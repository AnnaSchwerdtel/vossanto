Special Cases
=============

A collection of special cases of VA along different dimensions. (Some VA
fit into several dimensions.)

<!--

  Often we have several examples for each case. We probably should
  reduce that to a few cases each that show the diversity. Please do
  not remove such (proper) examples but comment them out.

- Willoughby is sometimes called the **Lake Lucerne** of *North
  America*

  who could capture the public's attention,'' he said.

  hasn't yet had*,'' said Michele Timms, a guard for Australia and a
  member of the Phoenix Mercury in the Women's National Basketball

  Scots who migrated to northwestern Montana before and after it

  Michelangelo** of *the Leica*," and her films assure her an enduring
  place in cinematic history.

  **Einstein**" and of Muhammad Ali as "the **Einstein** of *the Sweet
  Science*" hit the eye like a head-butt, and calling Ali's victory
  over George Foreman "an epic, a miracle, a revolution" throws
  rhetoric over the event while illuminating nothing.
- Some possible portents of doom: a recording that advertises
  Beethoven's Fifth Symphony as "the **'Star Wars'** of *symphonic
  music*" and Ludwig van B. himself as the **Kurt Cobain** of *his
  generation*; a famous young virtuoso playing "The Four Seasons" in a
  music video broadcast on the Weather Channel; arousing anthologies
