Special Cases
=============

A collection of special cases of VA along different dimensions. (Some VA
fit into several dimensions.)

<!--

  Often we have several examples for each case. We probably should
  reduce that to a few cases each that show the diversity. Please do
  not remove such (proper) examples but comment them out.

Hypothetical
------------

  Papermate, **the Chevrolet of** *pens*
- "New York State is **the Cadillac of** *social services*,"
  Mr. Alfonso said. "**Other states** have *Volkswagens*."
- A historian and journalist by training, he has nonetheless striven
  for years to bear witness to Montana history in fiction, and to
  become if not the Homer at least **the Virgil of** *generations of
  Scots who migrated to northwestern Montana before and after it
  became a state in 1889*.
- A noted French writer has called Leni Riefenstahl "**the Plato and
  Michelangelo of** *the Leica*," and her films assure her an enduring
  place in cinematic history.

  rhetoric over the event while illuminating nothing.
- Some possible portents of doom: a recording that advertises
  Beethoven's Fifth Symphony as "the **'Star Wars'** of *symphonic
  music*" and Ludwig van B. himself as the **Kurt Cobain** of *his
  generation*; a famous young virtuoso playing "The Four Seasons" in a
  music video broadcast on the Weather Channel; arousing anthologies
  of "Sensual Classics" aimed at heterosexual or homosexual listeners;
