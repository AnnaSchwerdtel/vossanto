Kemp of upstate New York formally announced that Edward J. Rollins, the former White House political director who headed President Reagan's re-election campaign in 1984, would serve as chairman of the Jack Kemp for President Exploratory Committee.+
6.  [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q51123][D. W. Griffith]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2D81738F93BA25752C0A961948260][1987/01/18/0004444]]) The former, *the D. W. Griffith of* /the avant-garde/, presents spectacular epics or ''operas,'' the latter, an autobiographical monologist, sits at a card table and tells stories from his life.
7.  +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q540087][Archibald James Campbell]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DA1730F93AA25752C0A961948260][1987/01/19/0005039]]) Who can identify the Campbell of Campbell's Fancy, the Wickham of Wickham's Fancy, the Greenwell of Greenwell's Glory?+
8.  [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q191499][Scott Joplin]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DE1538F933A15752C0A961948260][1987/01/20/0005135]]) High points of the show included the obscure Cole Porter bonbons, ''Two Little Babes In the Wood'' and ''Nobody's Chasing Me,'' Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle's ''I'm Just Wild About Harry'' (performed both as a waltz and as a one-step to show how a simple time change can alter a song's character), and piano compositions by Ernesto Nazareth, ''*the Scott Joplin of* /Brazil/,'' that blended ragtime and tango.
9.  [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1341644][Rich Little]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED61F3DF932A15752C0A961948260][1987/01/21/0005602]]) A backup quarterback is *the Rich Little of* /football/, spending the week before a game doing an impression of the opposing team's quarterback.
10.  +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q766166][Duncan Grant]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD8103CF932A15752C0A961948260][1987/01/21/0005631]]) When a Dufy of 1905 is hung next to a Duncan Grant of around 1916, we see at once how close was the best of Bloomsbury painting to certain rich, juicy procedures on the other side of the English Channel.+
11.  +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2960313][Charles Thomas Bingham]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DC1E39F930A15752C0A961948260][1987/01/23/0006189]]) According to Mr. Acevedo, Mr. Manoogian said in December that he had purchased the Bingham for $6 million from the Pell Trust, which is headed by Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island.+
12.  [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q93188][Errol Flynn]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DA173FF93AA15752C0A961948260][1987/01/29/0008167]]) He is also known by less flattering terms, such as the Aging Right Wing Actor, the Not So Favor-ite Son and *the Errol Flynn of* /the B's/.
13.  [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q34529][Bela Lugosi]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DA173FF93AA15752C0A961948260][1987/01/29/0008167]]) Mr. Reagan fares far better, nicknamewise, than some other Presidents in the compendium, including one known as Gloomy Gus, King Richard, *the Bela Lugosi of* /American Politics/, Richard the Chicken-Hearted, the Nero of Our Times, the Tarnished President, the Godfather, St. Richard the Commie Killer, President Truthful and Trickie Dick.
14.  [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1413][Nero]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DA173FF93AA15752C0A961948260][1987/01/29/0008167]]) Mr. Reagan fares far better, nicknamewise, than some other Presidents in the compendium, including one known as Gloomy Gus, King Richard, the Bela Lugosi of American Politics, Richard the Chicken-Hearted, *the Nero of* /Our Times/, the Tarnished President, the Godfather, St. Richard the Commie Killer, President Truthful and Trickie Dick.
15.  +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q335232][E. L. Doctorow]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7D71238F932A05752C0A961948260][1987/01/31/0008693]]) Just as the Czechoslovak composer incorporated such themes into his ''New World'' Symphony, so Mr. Skvorecky, a Czechoslovak author, brings to this ''first attempt at writing a historical and biographical novel'' echoes of American writers of the period from Bret Harte to William Dean Howells, with a nod to the E. L. Doctorow of ''Ragtime.''+
16.  +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5830724][Emerson Ellick Sterns]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D81E38F932A05752C0A961948260][1987/01/31/0008740]]) $10,000 Payment Was Planned Mrs. Whitehead was to have received $10,000 from the Sterns for bearing a baby after being artificially inseminated with Mr. Stern's sperm.+
17.  +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3320840][Monique F. Leroux]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3D71438F93BA35751C0A961948260][1987/02/08/0011228]]) 'I've been married to a business woman for 10 years,'' Mr. Simon said, ''and I've perceived that there are services that could entice her to a bank like this.+
18.  +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9358][Friedrich Nietzsche]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DC113BF93BA35751C0A961948260][1987/02/08/0011389]]) He is something like a parody of Nietzsche, not the Nietzsche of ''The Genealogy of Morals'' but of ''Ecce Homo.''+
19.  +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q91][Abraham Lincoln]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D6113BF93BA35751C0A961948260][1987/02/08/0011420]]) AT the Gettysburg cemetery, the Abraham Lincoln of Gore Vidal's novel barely gets through his first sentence - about the events in America ''four score and seven years ago'' - when the young Presidential secretary, John Hay, cynically observes that such rhetoric ''will please the radicals.''+
20.  [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1126679][The Scarlet Pimpernel]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDB1F3BF93BA35751C0A961948260][1987/02/08/0011467]]) The son of a banker, Salomon became *the Scarlet Pimpernel of* /photojournalism/ by virtue of the adroitness with which he could conceal his camera when necessary.
21.  [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q452206][Judith Krantz]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3D71F3BF93BA35751C0A961948260][1987/02/08/0011487]]) The heroine of the play is Diana Breed Latimer, a best-selling author of romantic fiction, *the Judith Krantz of* /her day/.
22.  +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3044][Charlemagne]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DF163AF93BA35751C0A961948260][1987/02/08/0011500]]) Mayor Marix, a travel consultant who counts the Emperor Charlemagne among her ancestors, complained of friction with Mr. Ilyinsky.+
23.  [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q128746][Irving Berlin]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DD163AF93BA35751C0A961948260][1987/02/08/0011525]]) Noel Gay was not, as some have claimed, *the Irving Berlin of* /England/.
24.  [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q209050][Jan Brueghel the Elder]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D6153DF930A25751C0A961948260][1987/02/13/0012870]]) Subjects like ''Flora'' and ''The Four Senses'' cause him to come on like *the Velvet Brueghel of* /his set/, putting his trust in multiplicity of subject matter and a high degree of finish.
25.  [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q762][Leonardo da Vinci]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DD103FF93BA25751C0A961948260][1987/02/18/0014363]]) Contending that Dr. Osborne had set himself up as judge, police expert and hand surgeon, Mr. Smirti called him *the Leonardo da Vinci of* /the Bronx/.
26.  +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3316590][Blue Angel]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DE163BF933A15751C0A961948260][1987/02/20/0014936]]) 'I started singing at the Blue Angel for two weeks and wound up being a resident there for quite a while,'' Ms. Stevens recalled recently.+
27.  +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5537484][George Bush]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DA133BF933A15751C0A961948260][1987/02/20/0014978]]) Today, in another of those developments, Mr. Bush announced the creation of the George Bush for President Committee, which he said would begin preparing for his ''likely campaign for President in 1988.''+
28.  [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1111386][Robert Moses]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDC173DF936A15751C0A961948260][1987/02/25/0016401]]) Why do so many prominent chefs and restaurateurs in New York and beyond describe him as the best-connected and most influential man in their business, in terms of influence sort of *a Robert Moses of* /culinary politics/?
29.  [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5443][Greta Garbo]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D7143DF93BA15751C0A961948260][1987/02/28/0017372]]) It was enough to make people wonder if McReynolds would adjust to the customary passion of the Mets or become *the Greta Garbo of* /New York baseball/, wanting to be alone in a city and business where it was not easy to be alone.
30.  [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q295107][Mr. T]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED9113CF932A35750C0A961948260][1987/03/01/0017607]]) President Reagan is said to be a great fan of the ''McLaughlin Group'' and has called Mr. McLaughlin ''*the Mr. T of* /TV journalism/.''
31.  +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q129937][Elephant Man]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DB163FF932A35750C0A961948260][1987/03/01/0017721]]) It focuses on the last seven years of Merrick's life, when Dr. Treves hospitalized the Elephant Man for further study.+
32.  [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q190152][Larry Bird]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DA1F3FF932A35750C0A961948260][1987/03/01/0017800]]) Peretta and other observers have so much respect for Pennefather's varied skills that round the league she has been dubbed ''*the Larry Bird of* /women's basketball/.''
33.  [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5237521][David Merrick]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DA1E3EF931A35750C0A961948260][1987/03/02/0018082]]) Mr. Mackintosh's credits include ''Side by Side by Sondheim,'' ''Little Shop of Horrors,'' ''Cats'' and ''The Phantom of the Opera,'' and some colleagues call him *the David Merrick of* /today's theater/.
34.  +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q152505][Leonard Bernstein]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5D91639F930A35750C0A961948260][1987/03/03/0018205]]) It began with Debussy-like textures, and integrated bits of Caribbean pop music in a style that recalled the Leonard Bernstein of ''West Side Story.''+
35.  [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1409][Caligula]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DB163CF93BA35750C0A961948260][1987/03/08/0019639]]) He's less well inclined toward such baseball personalities as Bill Veeck, who owned the Chicago White Sox during Mr. Kuhn's tenure and whom the commissioner considered something of a fraud (what really went on between the two men was a culture clash, the encounter of a banker and a street peddler); George Steinbrenner, the owner of the New York Yankees, whose antics unnerved Mr. Kuhn just as much as one would expect; August Busch Jr., the owner of the St. Louis Cardinals, whose decisions seemed dictated less by what was good for baseball than by how many cases of Budweiser it might sell; and various other owners - especially Charles O. Finley, *the Caligula of* /the Oakland A's/ -whose codes of style and behavior offended Mr. Kuhn's smothering sense of decorum.
36.  [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q327071][Paul Revere]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0DD1630F930A25750C0A961948260][1987/03/13/0021181]]) Mr. Blake, a retired businessman, became *the Paul Revere of* /Summit trash/.
37.  +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4355634][Nora Kaye]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D81639F936A25750C0A961948260][1987/03/15/0021484]]) While it is inaccurate to consider her as only a Tudor dancer, the Nora Kaye of every dance history book is epitomized by the image on this page - in her role as Hagar, the frightened spinster of ''Pillar of Fire.''+
38.  +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q296][Claude Monet]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D7123CF933A15750C0A961948260][1987/03/20/0022971]]) However, you can certainly get into the Andre Mayer galleries at the Met, where there is a Claude Monet of 1873 called ''Apple Trees in Bloom'' that will be the best possible substitute.+
39.  +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9960][Ronald Reagan]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DF153EF933A15750C0A961948260][1987/03/20/0023137]]) But after about a half-dozen questions, he seemed to hit his stride, answering at some length and with considerably more composure, even though he never oozed self-confidence like the Ronald Reagan of old.+
40.  +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21341309][Alan Orange]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DC123BF931A15750C0A961948260][1987/03/22/0023650]]) Adelphi, in beating the Orange for the first time since 1977, then got seven consecutive goals, three by Reh.+
41.  +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5537484][George Bush]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0DB173DF930A15750C0A961948260][1987/03/23/0024033]]) The error amused Mr. Mosbacher, who is not only chairman of the Mosbacher Energy Company but also financial adviser to the George Bush for President Committee and certainly worthy of the ''A'' list.+
42.  [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q158067][Vivienne Westwood]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3D9133CF937A15750C0A961948260][1987/03/24/0024133]]) AT one of the first and most energetic fashion shows here last week, a laugh-a-minute presentation at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts by *the Vivienne Westwood of* /Paris/, Jean-Remy Daumas, there were the town's most frivolous fashion trappings: Mohican fur headpieces and doggy-ear hoods, heart-shaped backpacks, pillowcases reading Oui!
43.  [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5592][Michelangelo]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D91E3CF937A15750C0A961948260][1987/03/24/0024161]]) Yet you have the gall to take up precious space between a mansard roof and a wood-and-leather lobby under the illusion that you can become *a Michelangelo of* /the art form known as living/?
44.  [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q937][Albert Einstein]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDD123DF934A15750C0A961948260][1987/03/27/0024878]]) If you are a fan of brains, you will no doubt get your fill with this enormous portion, which must come from *the Einstein of* /the calf world/.
45.  +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q966018][Frank Loesser]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED71039F93AA15750C0A961948260][1987/03/29/0025359]]) It originated in a much different form in Paris, and its principal authors, Claude-Michel Schonberg (music) and Alain Boublil (book) are Frenchmen, influenced as much by Bizet as by Kurt Weill, the Frank Loesser of ''The Most Happy Fella,'' and, in their use of pop-opera conventions, Mr. Lloyd Webber.+
46.  [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2857682][Clemente Susini]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DD1139F93AA15750C0A961948260][1987/03/29/0025364]]) In her sculptures of the last eight or 10 years she has, in effect, been both *the Clemente Susini of* /our day/ and -what is more difficult - the inventor of the anatomies that she puts together with such a dexterous hand.
47.  +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21341309][Alan Orange]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D9173BF933A05750C0A961948260][1987/03/30/0025820]]) The coaches in the Northeast who have watched the Orange for several years use words like ''brilliant'' and ''genius'' when describing his work.+

6064.  +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9458][Muhammad]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E1D9173FF931A25755C0A9619C8B63][2007/06/12/1854037]]) They are supposed to be issued by religious scholars who look to the Koran and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad for guidance.+

6067.  [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q162629][Simon Cowell]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E2DA153FF935A25755C0A9619C8B63][2007/06/16/1854714]]) (She is billed as *the Simon Cowell of* /matchmaking/.)
