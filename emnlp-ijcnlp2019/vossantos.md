    I sometimes feel like **the Anthony Quinn of** *my set*.\'\'
2.  [Madonna](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1744)
    ([1987/01/02/0000431](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D71F31F931A35752C0A961948260))
    Jimmy Johnson is **the Madonna of** *college football these days*.

    ([1987/01/18/0004444](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2D81738F93BA25752C0A961948260))
    The former, **the D. W. Griffith of** *the avant-garde*, presents
    spectacular epics or \'\'operas,\'\' the latter, an autobiographical
    monologist, sits at a card table and tells stories from his life.
4.  [Scott Joplin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q191499)
    ([1987/01/20/0005135](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DE1538F933A15752C0A961948260))
    High points of the show included the obscure Cole Porter bonbons,
    \'\'Two Little Babes In the Wood\'\' and \'\'Nobody\'s Chasing
    Me,\'\' Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle\'s \'\'I\'m Just Wild About
    Harry\'\' (performed both as a waltz and as a one-step to show how a
    simple time change can alter a song\'s character), and piano
    compositions by Ernesto Nazareth, \'\'**the Scott Joplin of**
    *Brazil*,\'\' that blended ragtime and tango.
5.  [Rich Little](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1341644)
    ([1987/01/21/0005602](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED61F3DF932A15752C0A961948260))
    A backup quarterback is **the Rich Little of** *football*, spending
    the week before a game doing an impression of the opposing team\'s
    quarterback.
6.  [Errol Flynn](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q93188)
    ([1987/01/29/0008167](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DA173FF93AA15752C0A961948260))
    He is also known by less flattering terms, such as the Aging Right
    Wing Actor, the Not So Favor-ite Son and **the Errol Flynn of** *the
    B\'s*.
7.  [Bela Lugosi](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q34529)
    ([1987/01/29/0008167](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DA173FF93AA15752C0A961948260))
    Mr. Reagan fares far better, nicknamewise, than some other
    Presidents in the compendium, including one known as Gloomy Gus,
    King Richard, **the Bela Lugosi of** *American Politics*, Richard
    the Chicken-Hearted, the Nero of Our Times, the Tarnished President,
    the Godfather, St. Richard the Commie Killer, President Truthful and
    Trickie Dick.
8.  [Nero](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1413)
    ([1987/01/29/0008167](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DA173FF93AA15752C0A961948260))
    Mr. Reagan fares far better, nicknamewise, than some other
    Presidents in the compendium, including one known as Gloomy Gus,
    King Richard, the Bela Lugosi of American Politics, Richard the
    Chicken-Hearted, **the Nero of** *Our Times*, the Tarnished
    President, the Godfather, St. Richard the Commie Killer, President
    Truthful and Trickie Dick.
9.  [The Scarlet Pimpernel](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1126679)
    ([1987/02/08/0011467](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDB1F3BF93BA35751C0A961948260))
    The son of a banker, Salomon became **the Scarlet Pimpernel of**
    *photojournalism* by virtue of the adroitness with which he could
    conceal his camera when necessary.
10. [Judith Krantz](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q452206)
    ([1987/02/08/0011487](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3D71F3BF93BA35751C0A961948260))
    The heroine of the play is Diana Breed Latimer, a best-selling
    author of romantic fiction, **the Judith Krantz of** *her day*.
11. [Irving Berlin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q128746)
    ([1987/02/08/0011525](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DD163AF93BA35751C0A961948260))
    Noel Gay was not, as some have claimed, **the Irving Berlin of**
    *England*.
12. [Jan Brueghel the Elder](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q209050)
    ([1987/02/13/0012870](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D6153DF930A25751C0A961948260))
    Subjects like \'\'Flora\'\' and \'\'The Four Senses\'\' cause him to
    come on like **the Velvet Brueghel of** *his set*, putting his trust
    in multiplicity of subject matter and a high degree of finish.
13. [Leonardo da Vinci](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q762)
    ([1987/02/18/0014363](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DD103FF93BA25751C0A961948260))
    Contending that Dr. Osborne had set himself up as judge, police
    expert and hand surgeon, Mr. Smirti called him **the Leonardo da
    Vinci of** *the Bronx*.
14. [Robert Moses](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1111386)
    ([1987/02/25/0016401](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDC173DF936A15751C0A961948260))
    Why do so many prominent chefs and restaurateurs in New York and
    beyond describe him as the best-connected and most influential man
    in their business, in terms of influence sort of **a Robert Moses
    of** *culinary politics*?
15. [Greta Garbo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5443)
    ([1987/02/28/0017372](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D7143DF93BA15751C0A961948260))
    It was enough to make people wonder if McReynolds would adjust to
    the customary passion of the Mets or become **the Greta Garbo of**
    *New York baseball*, wanting to be alone in a city and business
    where it was not easy to be alone.
16. [Mr. T](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q295107)
    ([1987/03/01/0017607](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED9113CF932A35750C0A961948260))
    President Reagan is said to be a great fan of the \'\'McLaughlin
    Group\'\' and has called Mr. McLaughlin \'\'**the Mr. T of** *TV
    journalism*.\'\'
17. [Larry Bird](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q190152)
    ([1987/03/01/0017800](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DA1F3FF932A35750C0A961948260))
    Peretta and other observers have so much respect for Pennefather\'s
    varied skills that round the league she has been dubbed \'\'**the
    Larry Bird of** *women\'s basketball*.\'\'
18. [David Merrick](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5237521)
    ([1987/03/02/0018082](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DA1E3EF931A35750C0A961948260))
    Mr. Mackintosh\'s credits include \'\'Side by Side by Sondheim,\'\'
    \'\'Little Shop of Horrors,\'\' \'\'Cats\'\' and \'\'The Phantom of
    the Opera,\'\' and some colleagues call him **the David Merrick of**
    *today\'s theater*.
19. [Caligula](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1409)
    ([1987/03/08/0019639](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DB163CF93BA35750C0A961948260))
    He\'s less well inclined toward such baseball personalities as Bill
    Veeck, who owned the Chicago White Sox during Mr. Kuhn\'s tenure and
    whom the commissioner considered something of a fraud (what really
    went on between the two men was a culture clash, the encounter of a
    banker and a street peddler); George Steinbrenner, the owner of the
    New York Yankees, whose antics unnerved Mr. Kuhn just as much as one
    would expect; August Busch Jr., the owner of the St. Louis
    Cardinals, whose decisions seemed dictated less by what was good for
    baseball than by how many cases of Budweiser it might sell; and
    various other owners - especially Charles O. Finley, **the Caligula
    of** *the Oakland A\'s* -whose codes of style and behavior offended
    Mr. Kuhn\'s smothering sense of decorum.
20. [Paul Revere](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q327071)
    ([1987/03/13/0021181](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0DD1630F930A25750C0A961948260))
    Mr. Blake, a retired businessman, became **the Paul Revere of**
    *Summit trash*.
21. [Vivienne Westwood](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q158067)
    ([1987/03/24/0024133](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3D9133CF937A15750C0A961948260))
    AT one of the first and most energetic fashion shows here last week,
    a laugh-a-minute presentation at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts by **the
    Vivienne Westwood of** *Paris*, Jean-Remy Daumas, there were the
    town\'s most frivolous fashion trappings: Mohican fur headpieces and
    doggy-ear hoods, heart-shaped backpacks, pillowcases reading Oui!
22. [Michelangelo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5592)
    ([1987/03/24/0024161](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D91E3CF937A15750C0A961948260))
    Yet you have the gall to take up precious space between a mansard
    roof and a wood-and-leather lobby under the illusion that you can
    become **a Michelangelo of** *the art form known as living*?
23. [Albert Einstein](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q937)
    ([1987/03/27/0024878](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDD123DF934A15750C0A961948260))
    If you are a fan of brains, you will no doubt get your fill with
    this enormous portion, which must come from **the Einstein of** *the
    calf world*.
24. [Clemente Susini](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2857682)
    ([1987/03/29/0025364](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DD1139F93AA15750C0A961948260))
    In her sculptures of the last eight or 10 years she has, in effect,
    been both **the Clemente Susini of** *our day* and -what is more
    difficult - the inventor of the anatomies that she puts together
    with such a dexterous hand.
25. [Basil O\'Connor](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q810041)
    ([1987/03/31/0025959](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D81F3AF932A05750C0A961948260))
    Where is **the Basil O\'Connor for** *AIDS*?\'\'
26. [Richard Pryor](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q294912)
    ([1987/04/08/0028366](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7D6103FF93BA35757C0A961948260))
    So Mr. Johnson moves through Harlem, clinical and profane in equal
    measure, acting as **the Richard Pryor of** *the safe sex set*.
27. [Grace Kelly](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3925)
    ([1987/04/11/0029124](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DD133FF932A25757C0A961948260))
    Local society columnists, much taken with her glamour and her new
    husband\'s social prominence, dubbed her \'\'**the Grace Kelly of**
    *Chicago*.\'\'
28. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([1987/04/12/0029177](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DE1039F931A25757C0A961948260))
    I saw myself as **the Johnny Appleseed of** *linguistics*,
    persuading hotel owners to put dictionaries in rooms everywhere,
    enabling weary travelers to look up the meanings and spellings of
    words used in late-night X-rated movies.
29. [George Steinbrenner](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q220210)
    ([1987/04/12/0029256](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D6133AF931A25757C0A961948260))
    They are **the George Steinbrenner of** *marathons* because they go
    out and buy as many names as they can, regardless of what the
    athlete\'s current condition is.
30. [Ingrid Bergman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q43247)
    ([1987/04/19/0031974](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4D81F30F93AA25757C0A961948260))
    He had called her Tiffany, which is fine for a call girl, but not
    right for **the Ingrid Bergman of** *dogs*.
31. [Duke Ellington](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4030)
    ([1987/04/22/0032772](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4D91F3CF931A15757C0A961948260))
    He has attributed some of his stylistic inspiration to Bud Powell
    and McCoy Tyner, but his creation of salsa concerto-style
    compositions led to his being regarded by some as **the Duke
    Ellington of** *salsa*.
32. [Horatio Alger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q453251)
    ([1987/04/30/0035452](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DF133FF933A05757C0A961948260))
    Mr. Chertoff called Mr. Massino \'\'**the Horatio Alger of** *the
    Mafia*.\'\'
33. [Horatio Alger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q453251)
    ([1987/05/03/0036349](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DF1338F930A35756C0A961948260))
    Mr. Fisher, of course, is the former chicken farmer who became **the
    Horatio Alger of** *undersea treasure hunters*.
34. [Oliver North](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q431223)
    ([1987/05/03/0036472](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DE133DF930A35756C0A961948260))
    In the Luce tradition, Mr. Malkin can coin a phrase: the economist
    Arthur Laffer is \'\'**the Oliver North of** *Reaganomics*\'\';
    Milton Friedman is \'\'one of those brilliant one-idea cranks\'\';
    and President Reagan\'s alma mater is the \'\'providentially named
    Eureka College.\'\'
35. [Napoleon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q517)
    ([1987/05/03/0036760](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD8133FF930A35756C0A961948260))
    This steady stream of income from the exploitation of a name
    synonymous with high fashion has earned him a sobriquet, **the
    Napoleon of** *licensors*.
36. [Howard Cosell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1472983)
    ([1987/05/07/0037931](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DC133EF934A35756C0A961948260))
    \'\'We need, as it were, **a Howard Cosell for** *the S.D.I.*,\'\'
    said Brig.
37. [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254)
    ([1987/05/10/0038761](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D81039F933A25756C0A961948260))
    Along with the thousands of failures, a few ritualistic pieces of
    musical consequence were produced, several by **the Mozart of** *the
    idiom*, George Crumb.
38. [Robert Wilson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q541526)
    ([1987/05/10/0038816](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DF1038F933A25756C0A961948260))
    Mr. Freyer, who is also a painter and is sometimes called **the
    Robert Wilson of** *Germany*, is best known for his stagings of
    Philip Glass\'s \'\'Satyagraha\'\' and \'\'Akhnaten\'\' in
    Stuttgart, but he has also directed and designed works as diverse as
    Mozart\'s \'\'Zauberflote\'\' for Hamburg, Weber\'s
    \'\'Freischutz\'\' for Stuttgart and Handel\'s \'\'Messiah\'\' for
    West Berlin.
39. [John F. Kennedy](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9696)
    ([1987/05/10/0039183](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DD1E3EF933A25756C0A961948260))
    In the 60\'s Mr. Bernstein looked like **the John F. Kennedy of**
    *culture*.
40. [Walter Johnson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q722059)
    ([1987/05/13/0039886](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED9113AF930A25756C0A961948260))
    So was Masaichi Kaneda, **the Walter Johnson of** *Japan* with 400
    career victories.
41. [Neil Simon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q315808)
    ([1987/05/15/0040577](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DD1730F936A25756C0A961948260))
    Cavalli\'s librettist, Giacinto Andrea Cicognini, was \'\'**the Neil
    Simon of** *Venetian comedy*,\'\' Mr. Echols said.
42. [Joe DiMaggio](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q297142)
    ([1987/05/16/0040728](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DF1F3BF935A25756C0A961948260))
    **the Joe DiMaggio of** *love*,\'\' he fantasizes while flexing a
    bicep that refuses to bulge
43. [Judas](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1710869)
    ([1987/05/17/0040949](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4D61638F934A25756C0A961948260))
    When the walkers dwindle to 11, he sees them as Apostles and himself
    as **a Judas for** remaining neutral. //
44. [Horatio Alger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q453251)
    ([1987/05/17/0041016](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DC1E38F934A25756C0A961948260))
    WHAT drives the marketers is the dream of finding the next kiwi,
    **the Horatio Alger of** *exotic fruit*.
45. [Bernhard Goetz](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q714892)
    ([1987/05/21/0042597](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4D8103FF932A15756C0A961948260))
    A former Navy official was quoted by The Baltimore Sun as saying the
    Stark\'s captain would have been seen as \'\'**the Bernhard Goetz
    of** *the Persian Gulf*.\'\'
46. [Walter Winchell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3097952)
    ([1987/05/22/0042798](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD9133EF931A15756C0A961948260))
    A recent historian has described Bald as \'\'the Boswell of the Lost
    Generation,\'\' but Root disagrees: \'\'In my opinion \'**the Walter
    Winchell of** *the Lost Generation*\' would have been more like
    it.\'\'
47. [Jackie Robinson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q221048)
    ([1987/05/22/0042958](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3D81130F931A15756C0A961948260))
    He added, \'\'In short, he is **the Jackie Robinson of** *the
    corporate world*.\'\'
48. [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([1987/05/23/0043074](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5D6153BF930A15756C0A961948260))
    What would Eddie Shore, known as **the Babe Ruth of** *hockey*, have
    said about this?
49. [George Plimpton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1508079)
    ([1987/05/24/0043458](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D91F3AF937A15756C0A961948260))
    In fact, he is more like an enthusiastic amateur trying to break
    into the major leagues, **a George Plimpton of** *international
    relations*.
50. [Woody Allen](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q25089)
    ([1987/05/24/0043683](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D6113EF937A15756C0A961948260))

    Compared to the younger smoothies, Mr. Altman, who called himself
    \'\'**the George Jessel of** *intellectuals*,\'\' addressed the
    audience from the standpoint of an embattled, aging hipster
    commenting amusingly on everything from the relationship between
    food and language to condom advertising.
52. [George Will](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1270178)
    ([1987/05/27/0044071](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2DF1339F934A15756C0A961948260))
    Some go back to Japan to become celebrities; for example, after six
    years in Washington, Yoshihisa Komori is now considered **the George
    Will of** *newspaper columnists in Japan*.
53. [John Henry](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2596171)
    ([1987/06/10/0048033](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D91238F933A25755C0A961948260))
    He\'s a horse who\'s had serious physical problems,\'\' said Dr.
    Lee, who treats human patients - including athletes from horse
    racing, basketball, football and boxing - at his office in South
    Orange, N.J. \'\'I call him **the John Henry of** *the trotting
    set*.

    She might be called **the Dan Rather of** *Shackelford County*,

    efficiency.
55. [Henry Miller](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q187765)
    ([1987/06/21/0050669](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DD1539F932A15755C0A961948260))
    Judging by the author\'s systematic peppering of his brief plot with
    gamey episodes of sexual improvisation, and by the hero\'s awesome
    arousability (a fleeting memory, an unseemly word, and he is in the
    manly state), one might think Mr. Faldbakken aspires to become **the
    Henry Miller of** *Norway*.
56. [Liberace](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q347528)
    ([1987/06/26/0052031](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2DA103AF935A15755C0A961948260))
    With a lot of flashy filigree and little swing or melodic
    inventiveness, Mr. Jordan threatens to become **the Liberace of**
    *guitar*.

    ([1987/06/28/0052404](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DF1138F93BA15755C0A961948260))

    The women had traveled 12,000 miles, all the way from Tokyo, and
    when they arrived in Manhattan yesterday, they had one man\'s name
    on their lips - Hiroshi Itsuki, **the Frank Sinatra of** *Japan*.
59. [Billy Martin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q508574)
    ([1987/07/03/0053903](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDD1F3AF930A35754C0A961948260))

    Andris Liepa, the son of Maris Liepa, is an exciting classical
    dancer with a very contemporary veneer, **the Patrick Dupond of**
    *Moscow* but with a poetic edge.
61. [Frank Sinatra](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40912)
    ([1987/07/05/0054412](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED91E3EF936A35754C0A961948260))
    Mr. Itsuki, who is known as **the Frank Sinatra of** *Japan*, was
    trailed by 180 of his most devoted Japanese fans, mostly unmarried
    middle-aged women, who paid \$5,500 each to make the trip.
62. [Buster Keaton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103949)
    ([1987/07/19/0057747](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2DC143BF93AA25754C0A961948260))
    As one person was overheard saying at a performance, \'\'He\'s like
    **a Buster Keaton of** *linguistics*.\'\'
63. [Henry Ford](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8768)
    ([1987/07/26/0059941](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2DC1F3BF935A15754C0A961948260))
    Mr. Safdie was described as **the Henry Ford of** *housing*.
64. [Jackie Robinson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q221048)
    ([1987/07/27/0060318](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2D8173EF934A15754C0A961948260))
    Venice reminds him of \'\'Othello,\'\' and prompts an analysis of
    the tragedy that ends: \'\'Othello was **the Jackie Robinson of**
    *his day*.
65. [Paul Harvey](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q772302)
    ([1987/08/15/0066105](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2DB1F39F936A2575BC0A961948260))
    Gabriel Heatter was **the Paul Harvey of** *his era*, but without
    Paul Harvey\'s understated subtlety.

    ([1987/08/18/0067049](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D91F3CF93BA2575BC0A961948260))

    Sort of **the Woody Allen of** *Hoboken*, Mr. Sayles uses many of
    his regulars -Maggie Renzi, David Strathairn, Josh Mostel, Nancy
    Mette - in \'\'Matewan,\'\' but he also makes maximum advantage of a
    deep-voiced newcomer named James Earl Jones, who does his best not
    to dominate the screen as the natural leader of the black miners.
68. [Pete Rose](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q739866)
    ([1987/08/23/0068626](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEED91331F930A1575BC0A961948260))
    Shays is **the Pete Rose of** *the Connecticut Republican Party*,
    hustle, hustle, hustle,\'\' said Robert S. Poliner, the Connecticut
    Republican state chairman, who called the win \'\'a tremendous shot
    in the arm\'\' for the Connecticut Republican Party and a \'\'good
    sign nationally\'\' for the party.
69. [Ralph Lauren](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q296647)

    ([1987/09/07/0072432](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2DE143BF934A3575AC0A961948260))
    What\'s more, Mr. Fryer added, the Governor is \'\'**the Bruce

71. [Walter Mondale](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49216)
    ([1987/09/07/0072470](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DC133BF934A3575AC0A961948260))
    It came from an unlikely source - Anker Jorgensen, an earnest but
    unexciting man usually cast as **the Walter Mondale of** *Danish
    politics*.
72. [Kitty Genovese](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q238128)
    ([1987/09/09/0072823](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D7143FF93AA3575AC0A961948260))

    Military officers were also offended by Mr. Arroyo\'s
    characterization of the army spokesman, Col. Honesto Isleta, as
    \'\'**the Goebbels of** *Aguinaldo*.\'\'
74. [Cecil Beaton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q697096)

    school of crime reporting; and a third, the novelist Michael
    Mewshaw, who, in \'\'Money to Burn,\'\' is so bent on making Steven
    Benson **the Alfred Dreyfus of** *southwest Florida* that he
    inflates what could have been a chapter of sharp-eyed criticism into
    a book-length orgy of nit-picking.
76. [Alice Cooper](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q332032)
    ([1987/09/16/0074975](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DE1730F935A2575AC0A961948260))
    What became an intergallactic dud was \'\'**the Alice Cooper of**
    *comets*,\'\' according to Mr. Schaffer\'s publicity.
77. [Roone Arledge](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3128961)
    ([1987/09/19/0075504](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDE1439F93AA2575AC0A961948260))
    Mr. Brandon, the 37-year-old founder of Cheerleader Productions, can
    be thought of as **the Roone Arledge of** *Britain*.
78. [Ray Kroc](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q319648)
    ([1987/09/20/0075758](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DA1739F933A1575AC0A961948260))
    THE vision that Mr. Zanker\'s energy serves is as simple as it is
    grandiose: He would like to be **the Ray Kroc of** *adult
    education*.
79. [Elvis Presley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q303)
    ([1987/09/20/0076210](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7D61530F933A1575AC0A961948260))
    If he is not exactly **the Elvis Presley of** *ballet*, Mr.
    Baryshnikov demonstrates a popular appeal that reaches far beyond
    the usual ballet audience.
80. [John Alden](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6218491)
    ([1987/09/20/0076271](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD71030F933A1575AC0A961948260))
    But you would not know that Senator Kennedy remains **the John Alden
    of** *American politics* unless you watched his part of the hearings
    in its entirety.
81. [Ozzie Smith](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q127494)
    ([1987/09/21/0076371](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DC153AF932A1575AC0A961948260))

    For Roger Miller, it\'s as much an electronic instrument as the
    electric guitar - and he\'s set out to become **the Jimi Hendrix
    of** *the electric piano*.

    ([1987/09/26/0077581](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2DE1330F935A1575AC0A961948260))
    Remember back when they were trying to tell us in certain areas of

    ([1987/09/27/0077678](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0DB1739F934A1575AC0A961948260))
    He was **the John Lennon of** *the Wailers*, sometimes abrasive and
    sometimes erratic and always outspoken, even when being outspoken
    didn\'t always serve his best purposes.
85. [Groucho Marx](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103846)
    ([1987/09/27/0077726](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDF1539F934A1575AC0A961948260))
    But the tide eventually shifted, partly because the supreme
    materialist of physics, Richard Feynman of the California Institute
    of Technology, a man once described as **the Groucho Marx of**
    *physics*, turned the quest for nuclear substructure into a cause
    celebre.
86. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([1987/09/27/0077905](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0DC1038F934A1575AC0A961948260))
    Dr. Allen, whose father is the entertainer Steve Allen, has in fact

    So while Marshall W. Mason commenced a long leave of absence from
    New York\'s Circle Repertory Company (he resigned last year), and
    Gordon Davidson did the same from the Mark Taper Forum in Los
    Angeles, Mr. Hall, at 55, began doing double duty, announcing with
    typical bravado that he planned to be \'\'**the Lenny Bernstein of**
    *the theater world*.\'\'
90. [Cassandra](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170779)
    ([1987/11/03/0089082](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D71139F930A35752C1A961948260))

    ([1987/11/11/0091723](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DC113AF932A25752C1A961948260))
    A letter to Ruth Sirkis - \'\'**the Julia Child of** *Israel*,\'\'
    according to Ms. Levy - led to a two-year stint as her assistant.
92. [Cecil B. DeMille](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q72267)
    ([1987/11/11/0091729](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2DF1E3AF932A25752C1A961948260))

    I don\'t think it is going too far to call Mr. Scanlon \'\'**the
    James Watt of** *consumer protection*.\'\'
95. [Barbara Walters](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q231417)
    ([1987/11/20/0094729](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3D81038F933A15752C1A961948260))
    She said she has been a television reporter for 22 years but
    disagreed with Mr. Moffett\'s description of her as \'\'**the
    Barbara Walters of** *Soviet television*.\'\'
96. [Elvis Presley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q303)
    ([1987/11/23/0095650](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDC1331F930A15752C1A961948260))

    To me the President has for years seemed to be **the Warren G.
    Harding of** *our time*, not the Herbert Hoover.
98. [Pete Rose](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q739866)
    ([1987/12/07/0099935](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DA1530F934A35751C1A961948260))
    Whatever the count, Mr. Wallace, 56 years old, still has a chance to

    ([1987/12/13/0101324](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DD1F3CF930A25751C1A961948260))
    But Mr. Schmidt, too, wonders about Mr. Adams\'s future role: \'\'I
    see him more as the facilitator, the introducer, kind of **the Ed

    If, as the author tells us, the deal is an art form, then the book
    makes clear that Mr. Trump sees himself as **the Michelangelo of**

    Kazantzakis and Nabokov\'s \'\'Lolita\'\' when others were too
    afraid of censorship to try.
50. [Lon Chaney](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q312656)
    ([1988/06/15/0153997](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE4DD123EF936A25755C0A96E948260))
    The notion has evidently got into his head that these high-class
    markings will harm him with the voters, for he seems intent on
    becoming **the Lon Chaney of** *politics*, the Man of a Thousand
    Faces.
51. [Connie Mack](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1126349)
    ([1988/06/24/0156226](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEED9113BF937A15755C0A96E948260))
    By contrast, Futch, 76, is a mellow type who speaks slowly and
    softly and carries himself more like an elder statesman, **the
    Connie Mack of** *the fight game*.
52. [Joe Namath](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q720558)
    ([1988/06/27/0157164](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE4D91030F934A15755C0A96E948260))
    We were a long way from earlier times when Mr. Nureyev was called
    \'\'**the Joe Namath of** *dance*.\'\'
53. [Pablo Picasso](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5593)
    ([1988/07/04/0158922](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEED91030F937A35754C0A96E948260))
    Is Joyce **the Picasso of** *letters*?
54. [Jackie Robinson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q221048)
    ([1988/07/10/0159990](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3DC1339F933A25754C0A96E948260))
    He is certainly **the Jackie Robinson of** *minority business*,\'\'
    Mr. Bellinger said of Mr. Lewis.
55. [Jesus Christ](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q302)
    ([1988/07/10/0160034](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEFD61139F933A25754C0A96E948260))
    More attractive though, is irony aimed at an obvious target, of
    which Jerome Witkin\'s \'\'Self-Portrait with **a Jesus for** *Our
    Time*\'\' is a striking example.
56. [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254)
    ([1988/07/17/0162061](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5DC123AF934A25754C0A96E948260))
    Gainsborough is **the Mozart of** *portraiture*.
57. [Eliza Doolittle](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q518503)
    ([1988/07/21/0163101](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DC143BF932A15754C0A96E948260))
    Gloriosa, **the Eliza Doolittle of** *Daisies*
58. [Norman Rockwell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q271884)
    ([1988/07/22/0163681](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEFDE1531F931A15754C0A96E948260))
    Mr. Paul, a 60-year-old Friar Tuck lookalike, is considered **the
    Norman Rockwell of** *television directors*.
59. [Marco Polo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6101)
    ([1988/07/26/0164793](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3DA1F3FF935A15754C0A96E948260))
    Marks was **the Marco Polo of** *the drug traffic*,\'\' said
    Thomas V. Cash, special agent in charge of the Miami Division of the
    Drug Enforcement Administration.
60. [Samuel Beckett](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37327)
    ([1988/07/31/0166391](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6D91538F932A05754C0A96E948260))
    He is a master of erasures and negations, a visionary of discomfort
    and reproof, **the Samuel Beckett of** *postwar American poetry*.
61. [Pat Boone](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q342778)
    ([1988/08/04/0167715](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE2DC1738F937A3575BC0A96E948260))
    If not for his experimental streak, Robert Palmer could be **the Pat
    Boone of** *the 1980\'s*.
62. [James Naismith](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q188962)
    ([1988/08/08/0168974](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1DA1338F93BA3575BC0A96E948260))
    That\'s because **the James Naismith of** *Hoover-ball* was the
    White House physician, Vice Admiral Joel T. Boone, who devised the
    game as a way to entice Hoover, who was notoriously lackadaisical
    about his health, into exercising.
63. [Wallis Simpson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q209417)
    ([1988/08/11/0169750](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5D71539F932A2575BC0A96E948260))
    And Janet Jones, the beautiful bride in what was built up as a royal
    wedding here July 16, was seen as **the Wallis Simpson of** *her
    time*, the wife who coerced her husband into leaving.
64. [Charles Ives](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q309648)
    ([1988/08/12/0170106](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5D6103AF931A2575BC0A96E948260))
    Mr. Scelsi, who was widely called **the Charles Ives of** *Italy*,
    was known for his choral and symphonic works.
65. [Mother Teresa](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30547)
    ([1988/08/14/0170859](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3DD1F31F937A2575BC0A96E948260))
    That willingness doesn\'t make him **the Mother Teresa of** *his
    time*, but it does make him a responsible businessman, a rare enough
    species in baseball.
66. [Lou Gehrig](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q357444)
    ([1988/08/17/0171750](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5D7123CF934A2575BC0A96E948260))
    The man who has won seven Daytonas and a total of 200 races -
    although none, Gary Carter, since July 4, 1984, which was 118 races
    ago - is already **the Lou Gehrig of** *racing*, about to start his
    500th straight race at Brooklyn International Speedway in Michigan
    on Sunday.
67. [Napoleon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q517)
    ([1988/08/21/0172829](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5D91338F932A1575BC0A96E948260))
    They were a completely different breed whose first confrontation
    with the North was not at Fort Sumter, but 38 years earlier, when a
    North Carolina colonel, known as \'\'**the Napoleon of** *the
    turf*,\'\' encouraged any and all Yankees to race their horses
    against the indomitable Sir Henry - for a stake of \$20,000.
68. [Marilyn Monroe](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4616)
    ([1988/08/28/0174823](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEFD81F3DF93BA1575BC0A96E948260))
    He\'s **the Marilyn Monroe of** *this industry*,\'\' said Bill
    Groak, editor of M.A.
69. [William Shakespeare](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q692)
    ([1988/08/28/0174916](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5DF113CF93BA1575BC0A96E948260))
    Sir Frederick Ashton was **the Shakespeare of** *ballet* - not the
    Shakespeare who wrote revenge tragedies but the poet who composed
    love sonnets.
70. [Herschel Walker](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q609950)
    ([1988/08/28/0174982](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7DC143FF93BA1575BC0A96E948260))
    Smith had been advertised as a rare, gifted combination of speed and
    power, **a Herschel Walker for** *his college generation*.
71. [Antonio Stradivari](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q182011)
    ([1988/09/04/0176939](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7D7133DF937A3575AC0A96E948260))
    It was made by W. Heckel, a German company that Mr. Segal described
    as \'\'**the Stradivarius of** *woodwind manufacturing*.\'\'
72. [The Hatter](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q864751)
    ([1988/09/11/0178234](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6DB1738F932A2575AC0A96E948260))
    They say it can\'t fly,\'\' whispers Hughes, **the Mad Hatter of**
    *capitalism*, \'\'but that\'s not the point.\'\'
73. [Barbara Walters](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q231417)
    ([1988/09/11/0178347](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6D6163BF932A2575AC0A96E948260))
    The tenor of this club is to denigrate, to humiliate,\'\' explains
    Freda Reeser, a member who calls herself \'\'**the Barbara Walters
    of** *the Hawaiian Jewish community*\'\' because she interviews
    visiting celebrities for a local magazine.
74. [Wayne Gretzky](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q209518)
    ([1988/09/11/0178517](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5DD1F3AF932A2575AC0A96E948260))
    No such distinction is made for women, and so Jeannie Longo of
    France, **the Wayne Gretzky of** *women\'s cycling*, will compete in
    the Games, as a heavy favorite.
75. [Henny Youngman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2586583)
    ([1988/09/12/0178948](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DC173CF931A2575AC0A96E948260))
    Mr. Dukakis is reveling in his new role; aside from the daily
    accusations and the angry speeches, he\'s becoming **a Henny
    Youngman of** *political snipers*.
76. [John F. Kennedy](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9696)
    ([1988/09/25/0182307](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE2DC1F39F936A1575AC0A96E948260))
    All told, the four years since he quit his corporate directorships
    on Bay Street to succeed Mr. Trudeau as Liberal leader have been
    shocking ones for Mr. Turner, whose supporters once hailed him as
    **the John F. Kennedy of** *Canadian politics*.
77. [Steve Jobs](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q19837)
    ([1988/09/28/0183345](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE4D71430F93BA1575AC0A96E948260))
    That Acer has come this far is something of a testament to the drive
    and unconventional approach of the 43-year-old Mr. Shih, who has
    become **the Steve Jobs of** *Taiwan*.
78. [P. T. Barnum](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766)
    ([1988/10/05/0185168](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEFD7163EF936A35753C1A96E948260))
    That was never more evident than at the opening ceremonies of our
    Olympics, staged by the longtime Hollywood producer David Wolper,
    **the P. T. Barnum of** *patriotism*.
79. [Muhammad Ali](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36107)
    ([1988/10/09/0186323](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5D9103BF93AA35753C1A96E948260))
    Until recently, the muscular, middleweight Ribbs, whom the racing
    press once labeled **the Muhammad Ali of** *auto racing*, might have
    reacted to such an incident by punching Pruett out in the pits
    afterward.
80. [Andrew Lloyd Webber](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q180975)
    ([1988/10/10/0186766](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7D81F3BF933A25753C1A96E948260))
    But more stems from Mr. Jobs\'s reputation as **the Andrew Lloyd
    Webber of** *product introductions*, a master of stage flair and
    special effects.
81. [Honoré de Balzac](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9711)
    ([1988/10/14/0187729](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3D7143AF937A25753C1A96E948260))
    Critics sometimes call Naguib Mahfouz **the Balzac of** *Egypt*
    because of the way his works express the pulsating energy of city
    life and because of their psychologically nuanced characters and
    broad social concern.
82. [Henny Youngman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2586583)
    ([1988/10/14/0187903](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0D7133CF937A25753C1A96E948260))
    The new revised Democratic Presidential candidate is exuding
    dazzling one-liners - **the Henny Youngman of** *American politics*.
83. [Bob Hope](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q94081)
    ([1988/10/16/0188478](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEFD81231F935A25753C1A96E948260))
    Comedy is Mr. Yoshida\'s specialty (\'\'I was once called \'**the
    Bob Hope of** *Bunraku*\' \'\'), and he has adapted a lot from
    Chaplin and Keaton.
84. [P. T. Barnum](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766)
    ([1988/10/17/0188726](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DF1139F934A25753C1A96E948260))
    It came from Joshua Evans, the hoopla-minded young proprietor of
    Lelands auction house in Allentown, Pa., who has emerged as **the P.
    T. Barnum of** *baseball cards*.
85. [Jay Howell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6128528)
    ([1988/10/17/0188734](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6D61E39F934A25753C1A96E948260))
    Giants Have **a Jay Howell of** *Their Own*
86. [George Marx](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1507864)
    ([1988/10/19/0189297](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5D9163FF93AA25753C1A96E948260))
    Someone noted that **a Marx for** *the 20th century*, an articulator
    of a new thesis and inspiration for social change, hadn\'t yet
    surfaced.
87. [Andy Warhol](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5603)
    ([1988/10/23/0190647](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6D6103EF930A15753C1A96E948260))
    He is **the Andy Warhol of** *opera production*, screaming at us to
    look at sleazy banality with tolerant eyes and recognize it as a new
    profundity.
88. [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([1988/11/04/0194523](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5DE1039F937A35752C1A96E948260))
    After all, who could ever again even challenge the 978 stitches (his
    count) earned by Eddie Shore, **the Babe Ruth of** *hockey*, during
    his 14-year N.H.L.
89. [Lorin Maazel](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q117710)
    ([1988/11/06/0195310](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5DA133FF935A35752C1A96E948260))
    As we have learned through his appearances at the New York City
    Opera, Mr. Siciliani is something like **the Lorin Maazel of**
    *Italian opera conductors*.
90. [Leo Tolstoy](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7243)
    ([1988/11/13/0197859](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEEDB1430F930A25752C1A96E948260))
    Although Mr. Chaudhuri may not be what Saul Bellow would call **the
    Tolstoy of** *the Bengalis*, he may remind many readers of
    Nabokov\'s Pnin.
91. [Juan Valdez](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2261466)
    ([1988/12/04/0203573](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE4DD1739F937A35751C1A96E948260))
    If **the Juan Valdez of** *catfish frowns*, the whole truckload is
    rejected and sent for a remedial swim in a fresh pond.
92. [Rod Laver](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q105550)
    ([1988/12/04/0203718](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2DD1726E233BC4A52DFBE6E958A))
    I was also nervous about joining **the Rod Laver of** *business* on
    his home court.
93. [Samuel Beckett](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37327)
    ([1988/12/04/0203748](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5DE173DF937A35751C1A96E948260))
    a master of erasures and negations, a visionary of discomfort and
    reproof, **the Samuel Beckett of** *postwar American poetry*.\'\'
94. [Joseph Stalin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q855)
    ([1988/12/06/0204254](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6DA133AF935A35751C1A96E948260))
    As a result, he is regarded as \'\'**the Stalin of** *Patchogue*,
    the Idi Amin of Long Island,\'\' which, along with many other
    aspects of the play, is a considerable overstatement.
95. [Idi Amin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q48231)
    ([1988/12/06/0204254](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6DA133AF935A35751C1A96E948260))
    As a result, he is regarded as \'\'the Stalin of Patchogue, **the
    Idi Amin of** *Long Island*,\'\' which, along with many other
    aspects of the play, is a considerable overstatement.
96. [Gilbert du Motier](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q186652)
    ([1988/12/12/0206044](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE2DB1E38F931A25751C1A96E948260))
    The next time troubles threaten in the Philippines or Pakistan and
    the urge to help is strong, you can suit up and say \'\'Lafayette,
    we are here\'\' in Manila or Islamabad and stand a chance of being
    welcome, says Representative Stephen Solarz, Democrat of New York,
    At a lunch in Mr. Solarz\' honor last year, President Corazon Aquino
    thanked him for his work on the House Foreign Affairs Committee on
    behalf of the \'\'Filipino struggle for freedom\'\' and addressed
    him as \'\'**the Lafayette of** *the Philippine revolution*.\'\'

    Keith Haring will be **the Peter Max of** *the future*.
99. [John Rambo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q951317)
    ([1988/12/25/0209560](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE4DD1F30F936A15751C1A96E948260))

1.  [Samuel Johnson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q183266)
    ([1989/01/08/0212236](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3DB1239F93BA35752C0A96F948260))
    That gets me back to legitimacy,\'\' Mr. Coogan explained, but his
    eyes lighted up when he added, \'\'I can be **the Samuel Johnson
    of** *comic books*: They are really just another form of
    literature.\'\'
2.  [Attila](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36724)

    Having read every word of Isabelle\'s book, I can only surmise
    either that she wishes to be immortalized as **the Lillian Hellman
    of** *the art world* or that the men with whom I spent every waking
    hour had, previous to our first meeting, collectively repented,
    reformed and miraculously transformed their characters without the
    benefit of any self-help programs.

    Mr. O\'Keefe, a playwright and actor whose surreal family drama

    president of the University of Tennessee and a former governor of

    Now it is Mr. Penderecki who is seen as having regressed into
    neo-Romantic recycling, Mr. Schnittke is prized as a, if not the,
    leading Soviet composer, and Shostakovich is **the Mahler of** *the
    80\'s*.

    Not only do we believe in that smooth and silent progress, but we
    recognize the canoe itself as one built by Remington\'s friend, J.

    And so we see his son, Reginald Jones, once again in pursuit of an
    absolute (this time justice), enlist in the Civil War in Spain and
    then again in the Second World War, where his experiences repeat,
    with little profit, those of his father; when demobilized, he is
    caught up in the Welsh nationalist cause, **the Groucho Marx of**

    The top-hatted statue will utter not a word about the American
    sucker, for the simple reason that Barnum - **the Michelangelo of**
    *buncombe, hokum, hoopla and ballyhoo* - was himself the victim of a
    hoax.

    The most Anglicized exercise may be IN TROUBLE AGAIN: A Journey
    Between the Orinoco and the Amazon (272 pp., Atlantic, \$17.95),
    Redmond O\'Hanlon\'s search for human or animal horrors between the
    Amazon and the Orinoco rivers, which serves to cement the
    Oxford-educated naturalist\'s reputation as **the Hunter S. Thompson
    of** *expeditionaries*.

    It was written by the title character of the book, the late Mary
    Swann, who is variously described as \'\'a poete naive\'\' and
    \'\'**the Emily Dickinson of** *Upper Canada*,\'\' and it reads in

    The British Prime Minister, who was described by Simon Jenkins of

    In a sense, they are **the Charles Ives of** *architects*; for just
    as Ives recaptured fragments of familiar American tunes within a

    One day he is acclaimed **the Einstein of** *the Diamond*, the next

    **the Rembrandt of** *Painters Ltd.*, saw her on this lovely October
    day.\'\'

6.  [Mike Wallace](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q325487)
    ([1990/01/26/0320277](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2D8113FF935A15752C0A966958260))

    It has often been remarked that the youthful-looking Clive Barker
    resembles the youthful-looking Paul McCartney; I\'d go a step
    farther and say that Clive Barker is **the Paul McCartney of**
    *horror fiction* - like the Cute Beatle, Mr. Barker creates popular
    art that is superficially cheerful yet melancholy, if not profoundly
    pessimistic, at bottom.
11. [Mike Tyson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q79031)
    ([1990/02/12/0325887](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3D6133DF931A25751C0A966958260))

    On both sides of the apartheid struggle, there are people wondering
    whether Mr. de Klerk will turn out to be **the Gorbachev of** *South
    Africa*, a reformer who sets out on a modest course of change only
    to find that he uncages forces that ripple through society in
    unpredictable ways, forces that even threaten to overwhelm him.
13. [Abraham Lincoln](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q91)
    ([1990/02/19/0328029](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6D7133BF93AA25751C0A966958260))
    PAUL TAGLIABUE, the commissioner of the National Football League,
    has freed college juniors for eligibility in the league\'s annual

    For several years now, Leo Durocher, who in some ways was both the
    Pete Rose and **the Billy Martin of** *his time*, has waited for a
    phone call that would tell him he had been elected to the Baseball
    Hall of Fame by its veterans committee.
16. [Pablo Picasso](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5593)
    ([1990/03/02/0330974](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5D71738F931A35750C0A966958260))
    Howard Finster: Man of Visions\'\' is a good straightforward report

    ([1990/03/04/0331531](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6D9133AF937A35750C0A966958260))
    As **the Steven Spielberg of** *knot-tying adventure*, Mr. Phillips
    spends most of his nonteaching hours armed with a video camera
    seeking out knot-tying people.
20. [Joe DiMaggio](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q297142)
    ([1990/03/04/0331905](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5D91131F937A35750C0A966958260))
    That achievement makes him a significant contributor to American
    mass culture, every bit as much as the 68-week winning streak makes
    him **the Joe DiMaggio of** *the Nielsen game*.
21. [Richard Nixon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9588)
    ([1990/03/04/0331905](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5D91131F937A35750C0A966958260))

    She is **the Michael Jordan of** *figure skating*, a dazzling
    athlete of uncommon skill who performs at a level unattained by many
    skaters, unattainable by most others.
23. [Maxwell Smart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1247268)
    ([1990/03/08/0332910](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7DB1031F93BA35750C0A966958260))

    But his insistence on replacing strikers with nonunion drivers, and
    retaining them after the strike, has made him **the Frank Lorenzo
    of** *the highways* in the eyes of Greyhound drivers, and raised the
    prospect of a long and bitter strike, Professor Shaiken said.
30. [Frank Perdue](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5488961)
    ([1990/03/28/0338652](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEEDB1E3BF93BA15750C0A966958260))

    Before Mr. Dinkins selected him, Mr. Schafffer said he dreamed that

    Today\'s sport for **the George Plimpton of** *the political world*

    A great many of our classic tales of travel and adventure (as
    bookstores customarily combine them) are ventures into the interior,
    explorations of the landscape of the self, even while they are
    advertised as treks across Antarctica or Arabia, assaults on snowy
    unreachable peaks, cockroachy crawls into the cracks of the earth,
    voyages alone around the world or those hunts that test **the
    Hemingway of** *the heart* - to mention some of our more popular
    ordeals.

    ([1990/05/13/0352759](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7DA1438F930A25756C0A966958260))

    The article on April 22 \[\'\'Elmont Seamstress Is **the Betsy Ross
    of** *Horse Racing*\'\'\] tells us that Antoinette Brocklebank sews
    25 percent of the silks at Belmont, so it\'s 4 to 1 that the winning

    Modernist principles and by the early 1930\'s was well on the way to
    becoming **the Mies van der Rohe of** *the genre*, particularly with

    \'\'baldness.\'\'
83. [Cassandra](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170779)
    ([1990/09/30/0387764](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6DE1631F933A0575AC0A966958260))

    But I have seen even greater perversities, if only on the movies or
    on TV; I saw Hitler waving in a friendly manner to fanaticized
    little girls of the Hitlerjugend; I saw mass murderer Stalin kissing
    a child with the red Communist youth organization scarf, a child
    whose parents ended up like so many in Gulag camps; I saw Gottwald,
    **the Stalin of** *Czechoslovakia*, smilingly joking with young
    miners, the builders of socialism and soon to be cripples; I saw the

    Having spent a good part of the last year and a quarter at the task
    of reading for an annual best-story collection, I\'ve begun to feel
    like **the Professor Irwin Corey of** *the short story* - the
    world\'s greatest living authority over a discipline that doesn\'t
    exactly exist, a professorship of nothing, tenured in the university
    without walls.
89. [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([1990/10/28/0396229](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDB133FF93BA15753C1A966958260))

    But teammates they are: Dooley, a fifth-year receiver, too slow and
    too small to be recruited, and Kirby, a sophomore running back who
    would only attend a school that would allow him to be **the Bo
    Jackson of** *autumn and winter*.
91. [Leonard Bernstein](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q152505)
    ([1990/11/04/0397821](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEEDE1439F937A35752C1A966958260))

    Emotionally speaking, Mr. Welliver is **a Clint Eastwood of**
    *landscapists*, and it is not unlikely that when he gets a museum
    retrospective, his clarity and competence will make him, too, a cult
    figure.
97. [Errol Flynn](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q93188)
    ([1990/11/18/0402002](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2D9133EF93BA25752C1A966958260))
    Nevertheless, Mr. Reagan was signed up and became \"**the Errol
    Flynn of** *the B pictures*,\" eventually making a couple of A films

    She is, as she says, a poet of \"serious play\" -- extravagant,
    large-spirited, querulous -- **a John Donne of** *the postwar
    American suburbs* who combines a breezy colloquial formalism with an
    underlying violence of feeling.

    He promised a three-day showcase of the newest and neatest
    brainstorms, a chance for inventors to rub elbows with other
    inventors -- including, of course, the man who bills himself as
    **the Thomas Edison of** *Japan*, a man who even invented his own
    name.
102. [Walt Whitman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81438)
    ([1990/12/02/0405597](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DB1F3DF931A35751C1A966958260))

    The souvenirs of Mascagni\'s opera \"Nero\" are 10 times as
    interesting if we remember that the year of the performance in
    question was 1934 -- a time at which Mussolini was shaping up to
    become **the Nero of** *his day*.
104. [Peter Pan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q107190)
    ([1990/12/07/0406630](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6D6163BF934A35751C1A966958260))
    Richard Tuttle may be **the Peter Pan of** *contemporary art*: the
    artist who refuses to grow up or old, or to settle down in any way.
105. [George Plimpton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1508079)
    ([1990/12/11/0407708](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDB163FF932A25751C1A966958260))
    Mr. Morgan also contended that \"Dr. Hammer presents himself as the
    architect of world peace, instrumental in arranging the 1985 Geneva
    summit between Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan\" while \"in
    fact, he is more like an enthusiastic amateur trying to break into
    the major leagues, **a George Plimpton of** *international
    relations*.\"
106. [Tennessee Williams](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q134262)
    ([1990/12/20/0409721](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5DF1F39F933A15751C1A966958260))
    I fancy myself, he said, \"**the Tennessee Williams of** *the dairy
    case*.\"
107. [Christopher Columbus](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7322)
    ([1990/12/23/0410524](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4D71F3DF930A15751C1A966958260))
    He\'d be considered **the Columbus of** *the art world*, only he
    wasn\'t even nearly the first European to claim others\' cultures.
108. [David Lynch](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2071)
    ([1990/12/23/0410588](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5D61631F930A15751C1A966958260))
    That meant, on Wednesday, eager introductory remarks by Mr. Kapilow
    that largely duplicated his own program notes, some silly
    overstatements (\"Beethoven, **the David Lynch of** *his times*.
109. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1990/12/24/0410716](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3DD1039F937A15751C1A966958260))
    But, in reality, I think I could be **the Michael Jordan of** *12th
    men*.
110. [Pat Boone](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q342778)
    ([1990/12/30/0411789](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDD1339F933A05751C1A966958260))
    How did **the Pat Boone of** *rap* -- slow, mediocre and
    unconvincing -- get the first No.
111. [Bear Bryant](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q278804)
    ([1990/12/30/0412106](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7DE1E30F933A05751C1A966958260))
    The reason Colorado is playing Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl is
    because Notre Dame (**the Bear Bryant of** *the times*), and not the
    Orange Bowl Committee, insisted a decision be made two weeks before
    pick-\'em day.

1991 {#section-5}
----

1.  [Willie Horton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8021572)
    ([1991/01/01/0412462](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE6D7103EF932A35752C0A967958260))
    But I think it\'s clearly a warning to us as Democrats that we
    cannot let them make quotas **the Willie Horton of** *1992*.
2.  [Shoeless Joe Jackson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q955322)
    ([1991/01/08/0413837](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE1D81E3AF93BA35752C0A967958260))
    He\'s sort of like **the Shoeless Joe Jackson of** *today*, isn\'t
    he?
3.  [Charles Dickens](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5686)
    ([1991/01/13/0414982](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4DB163CF930A25752C0A967958260))
    To make matters more peculiar, Mr. Ackroyd\'s is not exactly **a
    Dickens for** *the 90\'s*, at least not the 1990\'s.
4.  [The Hatter](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q864751)
    ([1991/01/20/0416604](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE6DC163FF933A15752C0A967958260))
    Thomas: Forget the hair club, she\'s **the Mad Hatter of** *rap*.

    ([1991/01/27/0418298](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEEDE1E3CF934A15752C0A967958260))

    But David Greenspan apparently aspires to be **the Richard Wagner
    of** *the genre*.
7.  [Stephen Sondheim](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q153579)
    ([1991/02/06/0420740](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7D81430F935A35751C0A967958260))
    In the elegant precision and savage acuity of lyrics for songs like
    Blizzard of Lies,\" \"The Wheelers and the Dealers,\" \"My Attorney
    Bernie,\" \"Can\'t Take You Nowhere\" and \"I\'m Hip,\" to name
    several of the roughly 100 songs he\'s written, Mr. Frishberg might
    be described as **the Stephen Sondheim of** *jazz songwriting*.
8.  [Elvis Presley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q303)
    ([1991/02/08/0421220](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE6D8173AF93BA35751C0A967958260))
    Vanilla Ice has been called **the Elvis Presley of** *rap*, but
    that\'s an insult to Presley, who transformed the blues and country
    music he drew on.
9.  [Emily Dickinson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4441)
    ([1991/02/10/0421854](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4DD123DF933A25751C0A967958260))
    -- becoming **the Emily Dickinson of** *the perfectly turned hem*.
10. [Dick Francis](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q314929)
    ([1991/02/17/0423942](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4DF133BF934A25751C0A967958260))
    Sam Llewellyn has been described as **the Dick Francis of**
    *sailing*, and for good reason, Newgate Callendar said here last
    year.
11. [Charles Keating](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5079691)
    ([1991/02/17/0423984](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2DF103AF934A25751C0A967958260))

    The students consider Mr. Sporney **the Vince Lombardi of**
    *model-bridge building*.
13. [Donald Trump](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686)
    ([1991/03/05/0427872](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2D71E38F936A35750C0A967958260))
    Mr. Tarasov reflects this history in wearing fine European suits and
    ties but hardly as **the Donald Trump of** *Moscow*.
14. [Margaret Thatcher](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7416)
    ([1991/03/17/0430682](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEFDB163DF934A25750C0A967958260))
    A front-runner for Ms. Vieira\'s \"60 Minutes\" job is Lesley Stahl,
    **the Margaret Thatcher of** *television news*.
15. [Napoleon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q517)
    ([1991/03/17/0430749](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DF1F3DF934A25750C0A967958260))
    The early compositions that established his credentials as **the
    Napoleon of** *the avant-garde*, like \"Le Marteau Sans Maitre\" and
    \"Le Visage Nuptial,\" caught attention for their Serial rigidity
    and the novel severity of their sonorities.
16. [Henry Ford](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8768)
    ([1991/03/24/0432181](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4DC1439F937A15750C0A967958260))
    My father, the Ford Motor Company\'s distributor for the entire

    ([1991/03/24/0432396](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DF103DF937A15750C0A967958260))

    He was **the Cardinal Richelieu of** *10 Downing Street*, a civil
    servant whose mastery of foreign affairs had made him so
    indispensable to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her successor,
    John Major, that in the end he become too notorious for his own
    good.
19. [Leo Tolstoy](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7243)

    Mr. Cantor, **the P. T. Barnum of** *the solo show*, is the producer

    Cheers seems to be **the Roger Clemens of** *prime-time television*,
    renewing its deal with NBC for top dollar.

    ([1991/04/11/0436543](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7D71038F932A25757C0A967958260))
    Mrs. Henry Parish 2d, as she prefers to be known professionally,
    could be called **the Queen Victoria of** *fabric swatches*.
23. [Clark Kent](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q79015)
    ([1991/04/12/0436865](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2DC153FF931A25757C0A967958260))
    Although the juiciest version of the story has Mr. Viertel, **the
    Clark Kent of** *Broadway*, flattening Mr. Freydberg, that one is
    untrue.
24. [Jackie Robinson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q221048)
    ([1991/04/14/0437373](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE0DC123CF937A25757C0A967958260))
    And as Augusta National\'s first black, Ron Townsend is a member
    under a microscope, **the Jackie Robinson of** *country-club golf*,
    a 15-handicap golfer with the corporate-honcho background that
    Augusta National prefers.
25. [George Burns](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q344793)
    ([1991/04/15/0437671](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3D71630F936A25757C0A967958260))
    And it was a fivegone conclusion that Mr. Borge -- who is becoming
    **the George Burns of** *the keyboard* -- would win a career
    achievement award at the convention.
26. [Kitty Kelley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6418571)
    ([1991/05/04/0442861](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE6DB1638F937A35756C0A967958260))

    Cartoons depict him with his hand caught in a cookie jar, and a
    local columnist has compared him to other haughty hoarders, calling
    him **the Leona Helmsley of** *the San Francisco Bay area*.
28. [Stan Musial](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1328142)
    ([1991/05/12/0444907](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE0DC153AF931A25756C0A967958260))

    ([1991/05/26/0448081](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEFDD103AF935A15756C0A967958260))
    In this history of the big top, John Culhane shows why P. T. Barnum
    was the Walt Disney and **the Steven Spielberg of** *his time*.
32. [Neil Simon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q315808)
    ([1991/05/28/0448667](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE0DF153DF93BA15756C0A967958260))

    Famed in her lifetime (1831-91) for her teachings as well as her

    Since Mr. Costner is \"**a Robin Hood for** *the 90\'s*,\" as the
    producers proclaim, this version of the medieval fable is violent,
    even though it has received a PG-13 rating.
38. [Klaas Storme](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2489036)
    ([1991/06/09/0451475](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE1DD133EF93AA35755C0A967958260))
    The most compelling performance was that of Mr. Weiss, **a Zaza
    for** *the ancien regime*, progressively transforming himself over
    the course of the evening into the ghastly porcelain figurine who
    wound up dancing decorously with Casanova at the ball.
39. [Nolan Ryan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q721948)

    If Mr. Greenberg can be described as **the Moses of** *the art
    world*, solemnly laying down the laws of painting, he is also its
    Ann Landers.
44. [Pat Riley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q335762)
    ([1991/06/24/0454960](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3D61739F937A15755C0A967958260))

    Leonard Humbrecht is **the Norman Schwarzkopf of** *Alsatian wine

    ([1991/06/29/0456236](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE5DD173FF93AA15755C0A967958260))
    Politics is one thing; sports is another, Toni Kukoc, a Croat
    nicknamed **the Magic Johnson of** *Europe*, said in an interview.
48. [Mary Martin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q285483)
    ([1991/07/03/0457223](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE5DA103DF930A35754C0A967958260))
    We call him **the Mary Martin of** *Off Broadway*, Ms. Kurtz says,
    referring to the actress who washed that man right out of her hair
    more than 40 years ago in \"South Pacific.\"
49. [Frank Lloyd Wright](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5604)
    ([1991/07/11/0458936](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4DC123AF932A25754C0A967958260))
    Many consider him **the Frank Lloyd Wright of** *industrial design*,
    not surprising since both men were born and raised in Wisconsin and
    did perhaps their most important work in the Middle West.
50. [Ken Russell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q55249)
    ([1991/07/12/0459273](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEFDC123FF931A25754C0A967958260))
    There are times when Mr. MacMillan can be mistaken for **the Ken
    Russell of** *British ballet*; like the film director, he would have
    us believe that true character can be revealed by the outrageous
    image.
51. [P. T. Barnum](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766)
    ([1991/07/13/0459422](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEFD7103CF930A25754C0A967958260))
    Tina Brown, who is **the P. T. Barnum of** *the magazine world*,
    obviously knows all this, even though she is originally from
    England, a country where journalism is not seasonal but schizoid,
    veering wildly between high dudgeon and women in thong swimsuits.
52. [Henry Kissinger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q66107)
    ([1991/07/14/0459865](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE0DB1031F937A25754C0A967958260))
    Mr. Roach\'s interest goes beyond aspirations to become **the Henry
    Kissinger of** *the audio industry*.
53. [Pablo Picasso](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5593)
    ([1991/07/17/0460751](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE1DC1130F934A25754C0A967958260))

    ([1991/07/21/0461868](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4D9133EF932A15754C0A967958260))
    But even if she turns out to be **the Liz Taylor of** *her day*,
    going through men like diamond necklaces, her audience is already
    lined up at theaters and newsstands and video stores.
55. [George Steinbrenner](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q220210)
    ([1991/07/21/0461989](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3DE1030F932A15754C0A967958260))
    In that history, Modell has been called **the George Steinbrenner
    of** *the Midwest*, another owner who meddles too much and hurts his
    team, and in the same breath he is praised as a man who provides the
    N.F.L., as it gears for the 90\'s and beyond, with continuity, a
    sense of history, intense loyalty and, judiciously, service.
56. [Moses](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9077)
    ([1991/07/21/0461993](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2DE1130F932A15754C0A967958260))
    Phrases like \"high priest\" and \"**the Moses of** *the art
    world*\" set the tone.
57. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1991/08/01/0464227](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3DE103DF932A3575BC0A967958260))
    I want to become **the Michael Jordan of** *golf*, said Woods, who
    prefers being called Tiger to Eldrick.
58. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1991/08/04/0465076](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4DD1231F937A3575BC0A967958260))
    I want to be **the Michael Jordan of** *golf*, said Mr. Woods after
    his victory on Sunday.
59. [Socrates](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q913)
    ([1991/08/09/0465813](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3D71239F93AA3575BC0A967958260))
    Saving the image of the game -- he fired Dave Pallone basically for
    being gay -- was his job, but as a man who saw himself as **the
    Socrates of** *sport*, that public-relations function would have
    eventually rubbed up against his higher conceits.
60. [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([1991/08/11/0466280](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3DF133BF932A2575BC0A967958260))
    Soon, Americans could immediately recognize an Eisenstaedt picture,
    and several generations of photographers, amateurs and professionals
    alike, tried to emulate their hero, **the Babe Ruth of**
    *35-millimeter photography*.
61. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1991/08/11/0466343](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEEDA1E3AF932A2575BC0A967958260))
    On a recent evening on the Upper West Side, Earl Manigault recalled
    the days when he was **the Michael Jordan of** *Harlem*, a man who
    jumped so high he once believed he could take off after a running
    start and end up sitting on the rim.
62. [Don Nelson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q375600)
    ([1991/08/14/0466892](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DA123BF937A2575BC0A967958260))

    ([1991/08/18/0467633](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE6D61E3BF93BA2575BC0A967958260))
    In The National Review, on the other hand, Jim Atkinson, referring
    to the comedienne as \"**the Hulk Hogan of** *feminism*,\" perceives
    her as \"a cunning marketeer who has figured out how to parlay a
    form of vulgar reverse sexism into stardom.\"
64. [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254)
    ([1991/08/20/0468225](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEFDB113EF933A1575BC0A967958260))
    Here was one of the great musical prodigies, a man who by the age of
    18 had composed major works for the chamber and orchestral
    repertory, who was responsible for the revival of interest in Bach
    in the 19th century, who was the acknowledged leader of German
    musical life before his death at 38 in 1847, a composer Schumann
    called **the Mozart of** *the 19th century*.
65. [David Souter](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q472547)
    ([1991/08/22/0468513](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE0DA153FF931A1575BC0A967958260))
    The nominee for health chief of New York State, Dr. Mark Chassin, is
    emerging as **the David Souter of** *gubernatorial appointees*, a
    man with little public record on major health issues and little
    freedom to stake out his positions.
66. [Henny Youngman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2586583)
    ([1991/09/08/0472147](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEFDB133AF93BA3575AC0A967958260))

    He is called **the Robin Hood of** *Patagonia*.
68. [Henry Ford](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8768)
    ([1991/09/15/0474006](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEFDB1131F936A2575AC0A967958260))
    Gates is **the Henry Ford of** *our generation*, and if you don\'t
    like it, go build a Honda.
69. [Stepin Fetchit](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1265202)
    ([1991/09/22/0475339](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DB1639F931A1575AC0A967958260))
    As a Caucasian who has seen just about every Charlie Chan movie
    there is, I must respond to the article by Gish Jen about
    stereotypes that perpetuate Charlie Chan as **the Stepin Fetchit
    of** *Orientals* \[ \"Challenging the Asian Illusion,\" Aug. 11 \] .
70. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([1991/09/24/0476016](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE1D8133FF937A1575AC0A967958260))
    What about news reports that Biosphere 2 is basically a survivalist
    cult built around the magnetic personality of John Allen, whom The
    Village Voice characterized as \"much more the Jim Jones than **the
    Johnny Appleseed of** *the ecology movement*?\"
71. [Robert Redford](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q59215)
    ([1991/09/27/0476549](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3D81F3DF934A1575AC0A967958260))

    at Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52d Street, on Oct. 9 and 10
    for the opening of its annual Octoberfest.

    Ms. Tandy is the 60th person to participate in the campaign, said

    Part of the reason for Mr. Brooks\'s success is marketing: with his
    meat-and-potatoes image, goony grin and virtuous all-American
    values, he is **the Kevin Costner of** *country*.
76. [Joyce Carol Oates](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q217557)
    ([1991/10/06/0478549](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE5D91E38F935A35753C1A967958260))

    They all called her aloof; yet J.C. Alvarez, a former aide to
    Senator John Danforth and staffer at the E.E.O.C., suggested that
    she might want to turn her experience before the Senate into a book
    or movie, saying she wanted to be \"**the Rosa Parks of** *sexual
    harassment*.\"

    I received a letter the other day which said the Governor has tried

    This will not come as a blow to many art critics and Conceptual
    Artists, who have long regarded Christo as **the Norman Rockwell
    of** *Conceptual Art*, and his wrapping projects as a one-note
    exercise.
89. [Johnny Carson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q310819)
    ([1991/11/13/0486648](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEFDD1E3CF930A25752C1A967958260))

    ([1991/12/08/0492265](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE6D8113AF93BA35751C1A967958260))
    Ted Nelson is an outspoken author and visionary described as
    everything from \"**the Thomas Paine of** *the personal computer
    revolution*\" to a \"madman extraordinaire.\"
100. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1991/12/08/0492282](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3DD163DF93BA35751C1A967958260))
    She\'s **the Michael Jordan of** *actresses*.
101. [Ernie Banks](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3051017)
    ([1991/12/09/0492566](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7D8163BF93AA35751C1A967958260))
    Sticking his hand in a glass bowl, Abedi Pele drew out the name of
    his own national team, Ghana, for an elimination round with seasoned
    Algeria and up-and-coming Uganda, making it possible for a star like
    Abedi Pele to become **the Ernie Banks of** *Africa*, never reaching
    the championship round in his sport.
102. [Willie Horton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8021572)
    ([1991/12/13/0493724](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE1D71E3EF930A25751C1A967958260))
    If the Governor decides to run, the Rochester serial murderer could
    become **the Willie Horton of** *1992*.
103. [Brandon Tartikoff](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2923786)
    ([1991/12/17/0494773](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2DA1730F934A25751C1A967958260))
    So in came the new executive producer, Al Harazin, trying to be
    **the Brandon Tartikoff of** *baseball*, turning around his series
    as Tartikoff overhauled NBC\'s prime-time schedule.
104. [Charles Barkley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q192707)
    ([1991/12/18/0494852](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DC133AF93BA25751C1A967958260))
    He\'s kind of like **the Charles Barkley of** *the Dolphins*.
105. [Robin Hood](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7352498)
    ([1991/12/19/0495009](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEFDD1238F93AA25751C1A967958260))
    The monthly bulletin of the International Foundation for Art
    Research dubbed Professor Feller **a Robin Hood of** *the arts*
    because he frequently stole from one museum or private collection
    and lent or donated the spoils to another.
106. [Thomas Paine](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q126462)
    ([1991/12/23/0495993](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4DB1F30F930A15751C1A967958260))
    MARTIN GARBUS, a Manhattan lawyer, said he feels like **the Thomas
    Paine of** *Prague*.
107. [Mikhail Gorbachev](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30487)
    ([1991/12/30/0497237](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE5DF1F31F933A05751C1A967958260))
    Will John F. Akers be remembered as **the Mikhail Gorbachev of**
    *I.B.M.*?

1992 {#section-6}
----

1.  [Paul Newman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41871)
    ([1992/01/09/0499117](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7DE1E3FF93AA35752C0A964958260))
    Although some in New York\'s Russian community have dubbed Mr.
    Solomin **the Paul Newman of** *Russia*, the bearded, 6-foot-tall,
    hazel-eyed performer bears more of a resemblance in person to the
    actor Robert Shaw, projecting the same on-stage gravitas and rugged
    introspection.
2.  [Amelia Earhart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3355)
    ([1992/01/17/0500887](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DC1F38F934A25752C0A964958260))
    In New York State, it seems, **the Amelia Earhart of** *women\'s
    courtroom dress* was one Carolyn Peck of Syracuse.
3.  [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1992/01/24/0502719](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3D91F39F937A15752C0A964958260))
    The Bills are not necessarily in trouble in Sunday\'s Super Bowl
    just because Thomas wants to be known as **the Michael Jordan of**
    *his team*, leaving the implication that Jim Kelly, the quarterback,
    is merely Scottie Pippen.
4.  [Bugsy Siegel](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q315487)
    ([1992/01/26/0503425](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFDF1F3CF935A15752C0A964958260))
    Then there\'s Jerry Tarkanian, the bald, towel-chewing coach at the
    University of Nevada-Las Vegas whose vision of populating the desert
    with jump-shooting urban nomads has made him, to the National
    Collegiate Athletic Association, **the Bugsy Siegel of**
    *basketball*.
5.  [Ronald Reagan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9960)
    ([1992/01/27/0503557](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE4D81639F934A15752C0A964958260))
    The two candidates who top voter opinion surveys -- Senator Joseph
    Estrada, a grade B movie star who is sometimes described as **the
    Ronald Reagan of** *the Philippines*, and Miriam Defensor Santiago,
    a former immigration commissioner who is portraying herself as a
    dogged corruption fighter -- are being written off because they lack
    the backing of a large political machine.
6.  [Hulk Hogan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q44176)
    ([1992/01/30/0504397](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7DB143DF933A05752C0A964958260))
    In the Delaware watershed, they say, the chinook salmon, a
    carpetbagger from the Pacific Northwest, would be **the Hulk Hogan
    of** *sport fish*, pursued with little finesse by anglers whose only
    goal is to land the biggest fish in the shortest time.
7.  [Willie Horton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8021572)
    ([1992/02/01/0504790](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7DD173AF932A35751C0A964958260))
    (All right, kiddies: Dr. Huer was the scientific genius with the
    lightbulb-shaped head without whom Buck Rogers would surely have
    lost outer space to dark-eyed Killer Kane, who was sort of **the
    Willie Horton of** *the 25th century*.)
8.  [Henry Higgins](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q637200)
    ([1992/02/09/0506507](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1DF1E3CF93AA35751C0A964958260))
    Mr. Easton, who likes to think of himself as **the Henry Higgins
    of** *Hollywood* -- he is even incorporated as such: \"The Henry
    Higgins of Hollywood Inc.\" -- is called upon several times a day to
    be just that.
9.  [Carl Lewis](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131237)
    ([1992/02/15/0507721](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DF173EF936A25751C0A964958260))
    But even if she did not, she has at least established herself as
    **the Carl Lewis of** *her sport*, its dominant sprinter.
10. [Neil Simon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q315808)
    ([1992/02/16/0507808](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7DE1438F935A25751C0A964958260))
    The association asked Fred Block, **the Neil Simon of** *Suffolk
    law*, to write a show, and, voila, the Island\'s first legal
    satirical revue was born.
11. [Norman Schwarzkopf](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q340137)
    ([1992/02/23/0509435](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE4D7133EF930A15751C0A964958260))
    When people here dubbed Eduardo Ieno **the Norman Schwarzkopf of**
    *Naples*, it was because, by this city\'s standards, he had achieved
    something as decisive, bold and gutsy as the American general did in
    Kuwait: He forced Neapolitans to pay their water bills.
12. [Jesse Jackson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q310586)
    ([1992/02/26/0509904](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6D81F39F935A15751C0A964958260))
    In some ways, he is sort of **the Jesse Jackson of** *the right*,
    said Mr. Gingrich of Mr. Buchanan in an interview.
13. [Diamond Jim Brady](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1680077)
    ([1992/02/26/0510044](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7DD1030F935A15751C0A964958260))
    He was **the Diamond Jim Brady of** *his day*, with more than a
    touch of the rock star thrown in, as he was pursued by mobs of
    adoring fans in the street.
14. [J. P. Morgan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q54168)
    ([1992/02/27/0510163](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE4DE143CF934A15751C0A964958260))
    Meanwhile, lending to blue-chip companies, which earned Mellon the
    sobriquet \"**the J. P. Morgan of** *the Alleghenies*,\" has fallen
    slightly since 1986, to about 46 percent of assets from 50 percent.
15. [Charles Bronson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36105)
    ([1992/02/29/0510431](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE2DE1638F93AA15751C0A964958260))
    And even his wife becomes \"**the Charles Bronson of** *organic
    gardening*.\"
16. [George H. W. Bush](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23505)
    ([1992/03/08/0512675](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFD81230F93BA35750C0A964958260))
    In that sense you are **the George Bush of** *New York City*, and
    what\'s going on here is not unlike what\'s going on in the
    Presidential races.
17. [Harold Stassen](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q887520)
    ([1992/03/08/0512675](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFD81230F93BA35750C0A964958260))
    And there\'s **the Harold Stassen of** *New York*, Herman Badillo,
    and the Paul Tsongas of New York, Richard Ravitch.
18. [Paul Tsongas](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q283884)
    ([1992/03/08/0512675](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFD81230F93BA35750C0A964958260))
    And there\'s the Harold Stassen of New York, Herman Badillo, and
    **the Paul Tsongas of** *New York*, Richard Ravitch.
19. [Galileo Galilei](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q307)
    ([1992/03/09/0512782](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1D8163AF93AA35750C0A964958260))
    Senator Daniel P. Moynihan is no defender of Mr. Mitchell as **the
    Galileo of** *welfare reform*.
20. [Phil Donahue](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1336253)
    ([1992/03/14/0514005](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE2D91530F937A25750C0A964958260))
    John V. Killen, an executive at Fidelity Bank, thinks of himself as
    **the Phil Donahue of** *the fair*.
21. [Arthur Murray](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2865273)
    ([1992/03/15/0514099](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1DB123BF936A25750C0A964958260))
    When it became evident that Ms. Ryan\'s jig had an extra jive, she
    was sent to a dance teacher, Donny Golden of Mineola, **the Arthur
    Murray of** *Irish jigging*.
22. [Che Guevara](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5809)
    ([1992/03/20/0515459](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DE1F3FF933A15750C0A964958260))
    Jerry Brown is going to be extremely dangerous, Mr. Hart said,
    \"because in essence he\'s going to be **the Che Guevara of** *the
    1992 Presidential election*.
23. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([1992/03/24/0516396](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE4DA133AF937A15750C0A964958260))
    Now it happens that generous, kindly and peaceful soccer may be
    **the Johnny Appleseed of** *sports*, carrying real grass to domes.
24. [Willie Horton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8021572)
    ([1992/03/30/0517697](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DE1339F933A05750C0A964958260))
    You editorialize March 3 that I am turning New York into **the
    Willie Horton of** *1992* by suggesting that \"New York and other
    large cities are responsible for their own dire fiscal straits
    because they are indifferent to rapacious unions.\"
25. [Charles Manson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q485508)
    ([1992/04/02/0518518](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5DD163EF931A35757C0A964958260))
    Mr. Rubino described Mr. Lehder, who is serving a term of life plus
    135 years in a Federal prison, as \"**the Charles Manson of** *this
    case*,\" and suggested that his history of drug use made him an
    unreliable witness.
26. [Marcel Proust](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7199)
    ([1992/04/05/0519231](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE2D6113FF936A35757C0A964958260))
    For some reason he has rejected the gold (there is nothing, for
    example, from Roger Kahn, **the Proust of** *the Brooklyn Dodgers*)
    for the dross -- including selections by Steve Howe about his drug
    problems and by Steve Garvey about his marital problems, as well as
    an interminable piece by Tommy Lasorda, which reflects the
    manager\'s amiable logorrhea.
27. [Cameron Mackintosh](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q712928)
    ([1992/04/12/0520605](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7D61638F931A25757C0A964958260))
    I want to be **the Cameron Mackintosh of** *Poland*, Mr. Kubiak said
    of the producer of \"Miss Saigon\" and other highly profitable
    musicals.
28. [Cinderella](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q13685096)
    ([1992/04/16/0521792](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5D9123DF935A25757C0A964958260))
    But the plain kitchen hutch was **the Cinderella of** *the show*.
29. [Mother Teresa](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30547)
    ([1992/04/26/0523892](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6DB133BF935A15757C0A964958260))
    To her fans, Annie Dillard is an avatar, or at the very least, as
    Bernays puts it, \"**the Mother Teresa of** *her particular
    genre*.\"
30. [Chuck Yeager](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q271939)
    ([1992/05/07/0526474](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6D91338F934A35756C0A964958260))
    But if Jordan is **the Chuck Yeager of** *basketball*, Julius Erving
    was its Charles Lindbergh and Connie Hawkins was its Wright
    Brothers.
31. [Al Capone](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q80048)
    ([1992/05/10/0527307](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFD8113AF933A25756C0A964958260))
    field agent was not your run-of-the-mill public servant, but a rabid
    zealot (\"**the Al Capone of** *the auditors*\"), Jill could use a
    traffic cop to sort out all the suspects eager to dance on the dead
    man\'s grave.
32. [Willie Horton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8021572)
    ([1992/05/11/0527805](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFD71F31F932A25756C0A964958260))
    If welfare emerges as **the Willie Horton of** *1992*, Mr. Cuomo may
    have wound up on the wrong side of it in a national campaign, even
    though he sought to curb the soaring costs of social spending
    programs.
33. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([1992/05/13/0528150](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6DB1638F930A25756C0A964958260))
    So Hall, who had earlier called himself **the Rodney Dangerfield
    of** *the American League* because he was omitted from the All-Star
    ballot, went searching for a little respect.
34. [Stanley Kramer](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q73136)
    ([1992/05/14/0528388](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFD91139F937A25756C0A964958260))
    Gordon is **the Stanley Kramer of** *theater producers*, said Steven
    Mikulan, the theater editor of The L.A. Weekly, referring to the
    film maker best known for his liberal movies of the 1950\'s and
    60\'s.
35. [Harry Houdini](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131545)
    ([1992/05/14/0528618](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE2D71630F937A25756C0A964958260))
    Over the past two years, Governor Florio has become **the Harry
    Houdini of** *state government*, he said, \"inventing one trick
    after another to disguise massive overspending.
36. [Leo Tolstoy](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7243)
    ([1992/05/17/0529227](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE4DB113DF934A25756C0A964958260))
    It is easy to sympathize with African resentment of the attitude
    epitomized by Mr. Trevor-Roper, or for that matter by Saul Bellow
    asking, \"Who is **the Tolstoy of** *the Zulus*?\"
37. [Dred Scott](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q480427)
    ([1992/05/22/0530662](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6D91F39F931A15756C0A964958260))
    Mr. Coleman\'s lawyer, Kathleen A. Behan, a member of Arnold &
    Porter who was not representing Mr. Coleman when the filing deadline
    was missed, said the case would be remembered as \"**the Dred Scott
    of** *death penalty law*.\"
38. [Jackie Robinson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q221048)
    ([1992/05/24/0531233](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6D8153EF937A15756C0A964958260))
    Though he dislikes the comparison because the rate of blacks
    entering professional golf has actually diminished, he is often
    called **the Jackie Robinson of** *golf*.
39. [Francis Scott Key](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q320633)
    ([1992/05/29/0532182](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DC173CF93AA15756C0A964958260))
    It was \"Country Joe\" McDonald, **the Francis Scott Key of** *the
    Vietnam era*, who dominated the movie, at one point leading 500,000
    fans in an obscene variant of a familiar high-school cheer.
40. [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([1992/06/01/0533054](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEEDF163CF932A35755C0A964958260))
    In those years he and the Grays\' catcher, the late Josh Gibson,
    were considered the Lou Gehrig and **the Babe Ruth of** *the team
    that won nine consecutive pennants in what are still called the
    Negro Leagues*.
41. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([1992/06/05/0533773](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DC1538F936A35755C0A964958260))
    Even today, the infomercial remains **the Rodney Dangerfield of**
    *advertising*, shunned and doubted for many reasons: state and
    Federal investigations of infomercial producers, complaints about
    product performance and, most crucial, a belief that a lengthy
    commercial disguised as a conventional program -- like a talk show
    complete with host, theme song and studio audience -- unfairly masks
    what is nothing more than a sales spiel.

    At the tip of the iceberg were several hundred Russian
    ultra-nationalists and Communist die-hards who gathered tonight

    No question that Sam Walton was **a Napoleon of** *merchandising*,
    keeping his troops lean and competitive, demanding 16-hour days of

    Mr. Keating, 48 years old, has been described as **the Lyndon B.

    However, Mr. Dragoul now has a new pro-bono lawyer -- Bobby Lee
    Cook, \"**the Ed Williams of** *the South*\" -- who is said to

    A sous-chef, in other words, is vice chef, sometimes shadow chef,
    frequently chef-by-fiat, often actually ghost chef, **the Cyrano de
    Bergerac of** *cuisine*.
97. [Ross Perot](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q313697)
    ([1992/10/29/0566366](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7D81E3BF93AA15753C1A964958260))
    The founder of the giant Hyundai industrial group and now this
    country\'s most outspoken presidential candidate, Chung Ju Yung, is
    tired of hearing himself described as **the Ross Perot of** *South
    Korea*.
98. [Winnie Madikizela-Mandela](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q239062)
    ([1992/10/30/0566594](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6DC103DF933A05753C1A964958260))
    They are closer to the assertive image that led an article in the
    conservative journal The American Spectator to label her \"**the
    Winnie Mandela of** *American politics*.\"
99. [Kennedy](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6389584)
    ([1992/10/31/0566750](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFDC1E3CF932A05753C1A964958260))
    (Her translation: \"Clinton is like **a Kennedy for** *the poor
    boys*.\")
100. [Pablo Picasso](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5593)
    ([1992/11/06/0568267](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DA1439F935A35752C1A964958260))
    The Metropolitan Museum of Art calls the great Chinese painter Tung
    Chi-chang (1555-1636) \"**the Picasso of** *the Ming Dynasty*.\"
101. [Arnold Schwarzenegger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2685)
    ([1992/11/06/0568296](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFD71438F935A35752C1A964958260))
    Sparks is **the Arnold Schwarzenegger of** *New York steakhouses*:
    big, brash and brawny.
102. [Donald Trump](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686)
    ([1992/11/06/0568315](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE2DD1138F935A35752C1A964958260))
    She describes herself as \"**the Donald Trump of** *the horse show
    world*,\" buying and selling horses like so many pieces of real
    estate, pocketing a profit and never shedding a tear as she watches
    her property being trucked away.
103. [Roger Maris](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q741023)
    ([1992/11/12/0569742](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE4DF133FF931A25752C1A964958260))
    It brought in more than \$50 million in pay-per-view billings from
    1.45 million homes, \"sort of **the Roger Maris of** *pay-per-view
    events*,\" Mr. Abraham said, mixing his sports.
104. [Stephen King](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q39829)
    ([1992/11/15/0570452](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE4DE123BF936A25752C1A964958260))
    It is almost an exact analogy to call Sir Walter Scott **the Stephen
    King of** *his day*.
105. [Pat Buchanan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q149127)
    ([1992/11/15/0570584](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7D6133DF936A25752C1A964958260))
    The first was from Barbara Ehrenreich, **the Pat Buchanan of**
    *radical feminism*, calling Mr. Buttafuoco a \"Guido-type person,\"
    and then, lest you miss the slur, asking pardon for \"the obnoxious
    ethnic reference.\"
106. [Madonna](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1744)
    ([1992/11/15/0570735](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE2DF1E30F936A25752C1A964958260))
    Didn\'t you once say you wanted to be **the Madonna of** *tennis*?
107. [Barry Bonds](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q314712)
    ([1992/11/19/0571427](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DB123DF93AA25752C1A964958260))
    The 27-year-old Hayes is not **the Barry Bonds of** *third basemen*,
    and he might have had a career season when he hit .257 and delivered
    18 homers and 66 runs batted in, but he silenced the criticism at a
    troubling position, and now the nagging questions will start again.
108. [Martin Luther King, Jr.](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8027)
    ([1992/11/26/0572900](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1DE143FF935A15752C1A964958260))
    Don\'t expect boilerplate Euro-bashing from Mr. Frank, who has been
    called **the Martin Luther King of** *American Indians*.
109. [Lord Byron](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5679)
    ([1992/11/29/0573421](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEEDF163EF93AA15752C1A964958260))
    Leonard Cohen, **the Lord Byron of** *Rock-and-Roll*
110. [Donald Trump](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686)
    ([1992/12/13/0576115](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5D7163AF930A25751C1A964958260))
    Father Ritter himself was often mentioned in the same sentence with
    Mother Teresa, but perhaps Charles M. Sennott\'s phrase, \"**the
    Donald Trump of** *Catholicism*,\" better captures the personal
    drive and entrepreneurial spirit that led to Covenant House\'s
    phenomenal growth.
111. [Bill Gates](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5284)
    ([1992/12/13/0576218](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DB123DF930A25751C1A964958260))
    I\'M **the Bill Gates of** *computer culture*, says Jeff Armstrong,
    who\'s been satirizing the Microsoft chairman and lesser members of
    the industry for six years as one of the world\'s first high-tech
    comedians.
112. [Tom Cruise](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37079)
    ([1992/12/13/0576330](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0D7143EF930A25751C1A964958260))

    It is perfectly in tune with revisionist French versions of \"Romeo
    and Juliet\" set on the Eastern side of the Berlin wall, Swedish
    productions like Mr. Ek\'s \"Swan Lake,\" which puts men as well as
    women in tutus just like \"The Hard Nut\" and the kind of
    \"Giselle\" with spoken text that Mr. Gallotta, **the Mark Morris
    of** *France*, threatens to put on next year.
114. [Red Adair](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q589905)
    ([1992/12/20/0577852](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DB1F3FF933A15751C1A964958260))
    LAWRENCE S. EAGLEBURGER doesn\'t look much like **the Red Adair of**
    *foreign policy*, flaunting his lame-duck status with a crippled
    bird pin stuck in his lapel.
115. [Vanilla Ice](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q313578)
    ([1992/12/27/0579154](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6DC113AF934A15751C1A964958260))

    Or will the waspish host of television\'s first post-modern talk
    show turn out to be **the Joey Bishop of** *the 1990\'s*?

    ([1993/01/15/0583131](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE3DA1F3DF936A25752C0A965958260))

    ([1993/01/24/0585396](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6DD123EF937A15752C0A965958260))
    In short, Leo Szilard was **the Rodney Dangerfield of**
    *20th-century physics*, an et al.
8.  [Ruth Westheimer](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q77688)
    ([1993/02/05/0588226](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE0DF1E31F936A35751C0A965958260))
    At one point Dr. Joyce Brothers, **the Dr. Ruth of** *yesteryear*,
    shows up as a coroner.
9.  [Bear Bryant](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q278804)
    ([1993/02/07/0588786](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEED61430F934A35751C0A965958260))

    ([1993/02/11/0589685](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5DB1530F932A25751C0A965958260))

    Less elaborate science-fiction than clever adventure caper, \"The
    Tomorrow People\" is lively and imaginative entertainment, its
    international cast featuring Kristian Schmid, an Australian
    18-year-old soap star who, Nickelodeon insists, has become **the
    Luke Perry of** *London*.
13. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)

    Wasn\'t she **the Grace Kelly of** *the Himalayas* who in 1963 went
    to live in a palace in Gangtok as the bride of the Chogyal, a man
    revered by his subjects as the reincarnation of an ancient Buddhist
    holy man?

    All the great Latin bands came through, from Oscar D\'Leon, **the
    James Brown of** *Latin music*, to Eddie Palmieri, the music\'s
    crazy, brilliant uncle; Mario Bauza, Tito Puente, Celia Cruz, El
    Gran Combo and Mongo Santamaria all showed up.
19. [Alain Marcel](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q18179336)
    ([1993/03/10/0595190](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE2DD1031F933A25750C0A965958260))
    First, it used a slightly adapted version of Tony Walton\'s set from
    the 1987 revival at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, with stage
    direction (by **the Alain Marcel of** *Berlin*, Helmut Baumann, who
    runs the Theater des Westens) that stuck closely to the New York
    version.
20. [Hillary Clinton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6294)
    ([1993/03/15/0596107](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE0DB143BF936A25750C0A965958260))
    Will Miss van Hamel, who has been Mr. McKenzie\'s partner offstage
    as well as on and who has a dance company of her own, become **the

    Lofton senses that the Cleveland Indians -- **the Rodney Dangerfield
    of** *major-league teams*, the perennial second-division dwellers of

    and big.

    The person pushing the bill is none other than Sir George Young, a
    gawky housing minister who fights for the poor and homeless in that
    traitor-to-his-class spirit and is lately lampooned by The Spectator
    as \"**the Che Guevara of** *the leaseholders*.\"
26. [Jerry Lewis](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q294927)
    ([1993/03/24/0597754](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6D6113DF937A15750C0A965958260))
    For himself, Mr. Lang leaves his options open, not precluding a run
    for the presidency after Mr. Mitterrand retires (a prospect that
    makes his detractors, those who see him as **the Jerry Lewis of**
    *politics*, cringe at his presumption).
27. [Jimi Hendrix](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5928)
    ([1993/03/26/0598111](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEEDB133CF935A15750C0A965958260))

    Thomas F. McLarty 3d, President Clinton\'s childhood friend whom
    they all call Mack and who is now White House chief of staff, was
    the chairman of the Arkansas Democratic Party for some of that time,

    Roger Corman, **the Louis B. Mayer of** *B Movies*, earned his

    romantically linked with all the cool guys.
32. [Albert Speer](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60045)
    ([1993/04/07/0600666](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6DB123CF934A35757C0A965958260))
    A former Peace Corps volunteer and the child of leftist Russian
    Jews, he now works for an American company that sells \"**the Albert

    is loaded with rap-related cameos that work only if you recognize
    the players (Fab 5 Freddy, Kid Capri, Naughty by Nature and **the

    of their own.

    new sitcom \"Church Windows\"; Tully Woiwode (Nick Mancuso), an

    When you\'ve got Steve Wynn involved, who I think is **the P. T.

    ([1993/06/02/0612641](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEEDE163BF931A35755C0A965958260))

    Fittingly, **the Patrick Henry of** *this drama* is an
    American-trained lawyer, Anselm B. Clouden, who by evoking the
    seafaring ways of his ancestors, and their descendants\' supposed
    mistreatment at the hands of Grenadians, has begun to arouse strong
    nationalist passions in his neighbors.
62. [Elvis Presley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q303)
    ([1993/06/11/0614470](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6D61139F932A25755C0A965958260))

    ([1993/06/12/0614699](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DB103CF931A25755C0A965958260))
    Mr. Barnicle, who has been called **the Jimmy Breslin of** *Boston*,
    joked in a recent column about buying an ascot and a hat in honor of
    his new employers from New York.
64. [Thurgood Marshall](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q312348)
    ([1993/06/15/0615573](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE3DB103EF936A25755C0A965958260))
    She is **the Thurgood Marshall of** *gender equality law*, said
    Janet Benshoof, the president of the Center for Reproductive Law and
    Policy, an abortion-rights advocacy group, repeating a common
    description of Judge Ginsburg.
65. [Dale Carnegie](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q230762)
    ([1993/06/20/0616689](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE4DB1631F933A15755C0A965958260))
    But Christopher Beach, director of the Performing Arts Center,
    described Dr. Lenz as \"no more than **a Dale Carnegie of** *the
    90\'s*.\"

    ([1993/06/22/0617020](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5D9103FF931A15755C0A965958260))
    In his place in the revival is Steve Blanchard, who may be **the
    Jean-Claude Van Damme of** *musical actors*.
67. [Donald Trump](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686)
    ([1993/06/24/0617369](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE2DD113DF937A15755C0A965958260))
    Before he became a Svengali to Boris Becker, a multimillionaire
    tennis manager, a touted prospect for high office in Romania and
    **the Donald Trump of** *fledgling Romanian capitalism*, Ion
    (pronounced Yon) Tiriac played here two decades ago against such
    stars as Rod Laver, Clark Graebner and Stan Smith.
68. [Madonna](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1744)
    ([1993/06/27/0618171](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7D71430F934A15755C0A965958260))
    Ms. Frank was **the Madonna of** *her day*, at least in breaking
    with tradition.
69. [Madonna](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1744)
    ([1993/06/28/0618352](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE3DD1E3DF93BA15755C0A965958260))
    Agassi, who is **the Madonna of** *his sport*, a sly marketer of his
    own flashy image, was more than up to the verbal duel.
70. [Michael Dukakis](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q319099)
    ([1993/07/04/0619263](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5D6123BF937A35754C0A965958260))

    ([1993/07/06/0619887](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEED7133EF935A35754C0A965958260))
    Let us not yet anoint John McEnroe as **the John Madden of**
    *tennis* on the strength of his Wimbledon analysis.
72. [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([1993/07/07/0620076](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDB1331F934A35754C0A965958260))

    ([1993/07/11/0620660](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE1DF1438F932A25754C0A965958260))
    She may not, as some of her activists-in-arms suggest, be **the
    Mother Teresa of** *progressive politics*, but she will, by all
    accounts, bring a steadying, working-person\'s perspective to an
    office that has suffered through a series of less-than-attentive,
    let-them-eat-cake administrators for roughly a dozen years.
74. [Liz Smith](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6660303)
    ([1993/07/11/0620690](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7D71238F932A25754C0A965958260))

    SOUNDING like **the Dr. Ruth of** *ballet*, David Richardson, a
    teacher and dancer at the American Ballet Theater, explained the art
    of partnering to a pas de deux class at the Y.M.-Y.W.H.A.
76. [Felix Unger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1889422)
    ([1993/07/13/0621332](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFD81E30F930A25754C0A965958260))
    Uecker went on to relate how Drysdale was \"**the Felix Unger of**
    *sports*,\" hated fingerprints on his bathroom mirror and \"if you
    slept at his house and weren\'t up by 5 or 6, he\'d make the bed no
    matter if you were in it.\"
77. [Dan Quayle](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49214)
    ([1993/07/14/0621422](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEEDC1E3DF937A25754C0A965958260))
    Others were less generous, portraying Mr. Cayne as **the Dan Quayle
    of** *Bear Stearns*, a consummate strategist in his career and his
    game but sometimes given to saying the wrong thing at the wrong
    time.
78. [Saddam Hussein](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1316)
    ([1993/07/22/0623263](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE0DE1F3EF931A15754C0A965958260))
    Until recently, General Aidid -- now defined as a war criminal,
    terrorist, **the Saddam Hussein of** *Africa* -- was Washington\'s
    best friend in Somalia.
79. [Frank Sinatra](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40912)
    ([1993/07/23/0623442](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DC1631F930A15754C0A965958260))
    After explaining that \"all the material has been satirized for your
    protection,\" Mr. Maher introduces his guests: the comics Larry
    Miller and Jerry Seinfeld (\"**the Frank Sinatra of** *nouveau
    comedians*\"); Robin Quivers, the longtime partner of the shock
    radio and television personality Howard Stern; and, from out of left
    -- or perhaps right -- field, the political consultant Ed Rollins.
80. [Salvador Dalí](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5577)
    ([1993/07/30/0625014](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7D71138F933A05754C0A965958260))
    Considerably more sensational are a startling photograph by the San
    Francisco artists Aziz and Cucher that shows a male nude whose
    genitals have been rubbed out through computer wizardry -- a kind of
    off-the-charts idealization -- and Alexander Hahn\'s \"Urbs
    Turrita,\" an installation consisting of three television tubes
    whose strange mix of old and new images, which include the tubes
    themselves set in interiors taken from German Romantic paintings,
    could establish the artist as **the Salvador Dali of** *television*.
81. [Nadar](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40116)
    ([1993/08/01/0625673](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7D71130F932A3575BC0A965958260))
    There never was a Mathew Brady or **a Nadar of** *the tintype*, but
    the pictures make up for any lack of mastery by their disarming
    earnestness and the charm that age has lent them.
82. [Bo Jackson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q887401)
    ([1993/08/08/0627283](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE4D7143CF93BA3575BC0A965958260))
    It is **the Bo Jackson of** *the bacteria world*, the
    bug-of-all-trades, and it made a reappearance last week in an

    One of his rare detractors paid him a backhanded compliment by

    But take a healthy dose of the man once characterized as **the Bart

    rhetorical form.
32. [Peter Sellers](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q177984)
    ([1994/03/13/0674080](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E1DA143DF930A25750C0A962958260))

    When one thinks, unavoidably, of a recently published diary of an
    11-year-old in Sarajevo, which some have perceived as a calculated
    attempt to manufacture **an Anne Frank for** *the 90\'s*, the
    genuineness of Anne\'s unshakable innocence and its compelling
    theatricalization is reinforced.
36. [Phidias](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q177302)
    ([1994/03/20/0675505](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E4DD163CF933A15750C0A962958260))

    As the Fairground Boy, Jon Marshall Sharp (late of \"The Red
    Shoes\") sports a bare torso under a black leather vest and has the

    His death at the age of 35 has turned him into **the James Dean of**

    that carried his photograph on its cover.
44. [Napoleon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q517)
    ([1994/05/01/0684057](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE1D91F31F932A35756C0A962958260))
    The inevitable memorial tablet, in English, at the lower terminal of
    the cableway reads: \"Across this \'dreadful cauldron\' occurred the

    In earlier years, he was **the Harold Pinter of** *dance*, largely
    because what he left unsaid in his studies of relationships was as
    important as what he expressed directly.
47. [Sol Hurok](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4535129)
    ([1994/05/08/0685821](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E5DB1739F93BA35756C0A962958260))

    As a veteran of the Congress Party governments led by Mr. Nehru\'s
    daughter, Indira Gandhi, and grandson, Rajiv Gandhi, the 72-year-old
    Mr. Rao has become, in effect, **the Deng Xiaoping of** *India* --
    an aging party leader who, in his sunset years, has abandoned many,
    if not all, of the economic precepts that had guided earlier
    governments, challenging not only the old orthodoxies but an
    entrenched network of vested interests that had built up under the
    old system.
49. [Aldrich Ames](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q452267)
    ([1994/05/08/0685978](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E4DA1539F93BA35756C0A962958260))
    Mr. Brock\'s role in the Paula Jones affair is curious indeed, so
    much so that some might take him for a Clinton mole in the
    conservative camp -- **the Aldrich Ames of** *The American
    Spectator*.
50. [Mathew Brady](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q187850)
    ([1994/05/08/0686097](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E4DB1130F93BA35756C0A962958260))

    ([1994/05/10/0686448](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E0DF1339F933A25756C0A962958260))
    Frazier is **the Bill Stern of** *basketball analysis*, an
    embellisher blindly dishing and swishing his Lesser Word Power in 20
    Minutes approach to broadcasting.
52. [Magic Johnson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q134183)
    ([1994/05/13/0687037](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E1DC1E39F930A25756C0A962958260))
    Once upon a time, Mason could have been **the Magic Johnson of**

    dribbling.

    (If there is a club worth going to, Mr. McGrath, **the Blaine Trump
    of** *lower Manhattan*, is on its permanent guest list.)
54. [Peter Lynch](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1156395)
    ([1994/05/22/0688898](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07EFDE1338F931A15756C0A962958260))

    At one point, Erik\'s lawyer, Leslie Abramson, **the Bette Midler
    of** *the criminal courtroom*, stuck tacks into the photograph of a
    naked child\'s torso for shamelessly vivid illustration.
56. [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([1994/05/25/0689494](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7D61F38F936A15756C0A962958260))
    He was the natural, **the Babe Ruth of** *jazz*, and before the word
    crossover had any meaning, he was one of very few black men who were
    listened to or watched by whites in an America so much whiter than
    it is now.
57. [Typhoid Mary](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q238948)
    ([1994/05/27/0689932](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE1DD143BF934A15756C0A962958260))
    Aside from a fondness for golf, Mr. Watkins will be remembered at
    1600 Pennsylvania as **a Typhoid Mary of** *travel arrangements*.

    ([1994/05/29/0690176](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00EFDE1F38F93AA15756C0A962958260))
    If Istanbul is **the T. E. Lawrence of** *world capitals*, sword
    unsheathed and racing on horseback toward another clash with
    history, then Washington is Indiana Jones -- handsome and dashing in
    its porkpie hat and bullwhip, but only playing a part.
59. [Anthony Trollope](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q318399)
    ([1994/06/05/0691458](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404EFDA163BF936A35755C0A962958260))
    If Raymond Carver, **the Anthony Trollope of** *American white
    trash*, had been just a little bit nuttier -- and was still alive
    and writing -- or if Stephen King could write at all, either one of
    them would be proud to produce something like \"Pluto, Animal
    Lover.\"
60. [Marcel Marceau](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q157191)

    ([1994/06/08/0692271](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E0DF153AF93BA35755C0A962958260))
    David Hobson, who I\'m told is sometimes referred to as **the Mel
    Gibson of** *opera Down Under*, is a dashing Rodolfo, even managing
    to look meltingly sensitive in a black leather jacket.
62. [Pat Boone](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q342778)
    ([1994/06/20/0694707](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07EFD6123DF933A15755C0A962958260))
    If Vanilla Ice is **the Pat Boone of** *hip-hop*, watering down a
    vibrant black musical form to make it appeal to a generic pop
    audience, then G. Love is its Elvis Presley.
63. [Norman Podhoretz](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q945011)
    ([1994/06/26/0695595](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE4DB163DF935A15755C0A962958260))

    A seasoned foreign correspondent, she often finds herself preceded
    by an eager James A. Baker 3d, then Secretary of State, as she
    grills people like Askar Akaev, \"**the John F. Kennedy of**

    what she sees as the only genuinely democratic new republic in the
    region, mountainous Kyrgyzstan.

    Over the years, this man, whom one of the Russian artists calls
    \"**the Lorenzo de\' Medici of** *Russian art*\" spent more than \$3
    million of his own money, operating under secretive and quasi-legal
    conditions that posed considerable risk both to himself and to the
    artists whom he befriended and patronized on his many trips to the
    former Soviet Union.
127. [George Mikan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q314185)

1.  [Steven Spielberg](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8877)
    ([1995/01/02/0734586](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEFDE1039F931A35752C0A963958260))
    FUTURE: Some industry executives call Mr. Knight **the Spielberg
    of** *hip-hop*, but they wonder if he can stay out of legal trouble.
2.  [Auguste Rodin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30755)
    ([1995/01/05/0735124](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DD1E3CF936A35752C0A963958260))
    His friend the Marquis de Lafayette recommended D\'Angers, **the
    Rodin of** *his time*, as anyone visiting the Louvre\'s Richelieu
    Court can see.
3.  [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([1995/01/05/0735173](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7D7113EF936A35752C0A963958260))
    The office of Rush Limbaugh, **the Babe Ruth of** *the talk-show
    circuit*, said Mr. Limbaugh was on vacation.
4.  [Willie Horton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8021572)
    ([1995/01/09/0735946](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DD143BF93AA35752C0A963958260))
    The need to cut either welfare or promised retirement benefits
    exists only in the political posturing that is **the Willie Horton
    of** *the 1990\'s*.
5.  [Camille Paglia](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q255463)
    ([1995/01/13/0736539](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEED91539F930A25752C0A963958260))
    Ms. Minter seems to be flirting with the idea that there is
    something glamorous as well as perverse about the sexual obsessions
    she chronicles; perhaps she wants to be **the Camille Paglia of**
    *the visual arts*.
6.  [Marco Polo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6101)
    ([1995/01/15/0737073](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE3DE123FF936A25752C0A963958260))
    A friend of his, he tells us, gave him a chronicle of the famous
    14th-century North African traveler Ibn Battuta (**the Marco Polo
    of** *Islam*, he has been called), who left his Moroccan birthplace,
    at the age of 21, on travels that took him, over the course of 30
    years, eastward to India and China, northward to Central Asia and
    deep into Africa.
7.  [Ted Turner](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q193368)
    ([1995/01/15/0737125](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7D91731F936A25752C0A963958260))
    He has been **the Ted Turner of** *his sport*, at times colorizing
    it unmercifully, but ever able.
8.  [Samuel Pepys](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q106143)
    ([1995/01/15/0737169](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE0DB1730F936A25752C0A963958260))
    Pugh presents himself as **the Samuel Pepys of** *the park*, witness
    to the eerie, violent goings-on.
9.  [Paul Revere](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q327071)
    ([1995/01/16/0737254](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE0DB1F39F935A25752C0A963958260))
    These days, Mr. Moorlach is making speeches, appearing on radio
    shows and trying to capitalize on his new image as **a Paul Revere
    of** *municipal finance*.
10. [Cornelius Vanderbilt](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q313721)
    ([1995/01/19/0737800](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE0D81E38F93AA25752C0A963958260))
    If the mild-mannered entrepreneur wants to become **the Cornelius
    Vanderbilt of** *late 20th-century Brazil*, his compatriots learned
    long ago not to laugh at his vision of a private railroad extending
    across Brazil\'s western frontier.
11. [Jackie Joyner-Kersee](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q209390)
    ([1995/01/20/0738148](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6DE113CF933A15752C0A963958260))
    Raschker, **the Jackie Joyner-Kersee of** *Masters track and field*,
    has won dozens of other national and world titles in the sprints,
    hurdles, jumps and heptathlon.
12. [Dizzy Gillespie](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49575)
    ([1995/02/01/0740755](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE4D91738F932A35751C0A963958260))
    One might doubt that the cheek of a halibut would constitute a
    substantial repast for a healthy adult, but the thick, meaty portion
    seems to have come from **the Dizzy Gillespie of** *the deep*.
13. [Joan Rivers](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q240933)
    ([1995/02/01/0740881](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5DF1131F932A35751C0A963958260))
    At age 59, Mrs. Fue looks and acts like **the Joan Rivers of**
    *Woodstown*.
14. [Philip Johnson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q183528)
    ([1995/02/05/0741684](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2DE103EF936A35751C0A963958260))
    Probably no one has profited more from this system than Josef
    Kleihues, who has become **the Philip Johnson of** *Berlin* -- an
    eminent architect with an unusual combination of political power and
    esthetic clout.
15. [Mother Teresa](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30547)
    ([1995/02/06/0741881](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2DB143EF935A35751C0A963958260))
    Mrs. Porter was once called \"**the Mother Teresa of** *Houston*,\"
    and she is no less experienced in dealing with the news media.
16. [Mario Cuomo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q521145)
    ([1995/02/09/0742308](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2DD1E3DF93AA35751C0A963958260))
    Is he going to be **the Mario Cuomo of** *1996*?
17. [Adolf Hitler](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q352)
    ([1995/02/10/0742588](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE4D71F30F933A25751C0A963958260))
    A recent editorial in The Hindustan Times, one of the country\'s
    most influential newspapers, described Mr. Seshan as \"**the Fuhrer
    of** *the Indian poll \'Reich\'* \" for his habit of issuing
    directives that his critics say reach far beyond election statutes.
18. [Robert Novak](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1954907)
    ([1995/02/11/0742594](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEFDC1539F932A25751C0A963958260))
    Mr. Will ventured so far as to try to get Ms. Rivlin to say
    something one could understand about the relation between the budget
    and interest rates, and even Sam Donaldson, **the Robert Novak of**
    *the middling left*, avoided treating the subject as if it were a
    wrestling match.
19. [Ron Rosenbaum](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1241100)
    ([1995/02/12/0742770](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE4DA1339F931A25751C0A963958260))
    As a society, we simply cannot afford to wait until **a Ron
    Rosenbaum of** *the 21st century* unearths the racist and
    misogynistic horror of the paradigm of behavioral genetics.
20. [Ed Asner](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q154421)
    ([1995/02/12/0742777](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6D61039F931A25751C0A963958260))
    Characters that never saw the light of day include Nipsy and Russell
    (either two possums or two raccoons), Bossy Beaver and Doyle (\"sort
    of **the Ed Asner of** *beavers* and his moronic sidekick\") and the
    amoeba stars of \"As the Petri Dish Turns.\"
21. [Franz Kafka](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q905)
    ([1995/02/12/0743054](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DB1430F931A25751C0A963958260))
    Robert Frank and Lee Friedlander may have racked up as many honors,
    and Richard Avedon may have gained wider name recognition, but none
    of them can claim to possess her black-crepe glamour as **the Kafka
    of** *American photography*.
22. [Frank Perdue](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5488961)
    ([1995/02/13/0743158](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE0D8143FF930A25751C0A963958260))
    I was once **the Frank Perdue of** *Leningrad*, he said.
23. [Magic Johnson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q134183)
    ([1995/02/14/0743308](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1DF123EF937A25751C0A963958260))
    With his black hair parted slightly to the right, Holman was the
    playmaker, **the Magic Johnson of** *his time*.
24. [Kurt Cobain](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8446)
    ([1995/02/19/0744055](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DA1539F93AA25751C0A963958260))
    Some possible portents of doom: a recording that advertises
    Beethoven\'s Fifth Symphony as \"the \'Star Wars\' of symphonic
    music\" and Ludwig van B. himself as **the Kurt Cobain of** *his
    generation*; a famous young virtuoso playing \"The Four Seasons\" in
    a music video broadcast on the Weather Channel; arousing anthologies
    of \"Sensual Classics\" aimed at heterosexual or homosexual
    listeners; disks of Arvo Part\'s music stamped with a descriptive
    blurb from Michael Stipe of R.E.M.
25. [The Scarlet Pimpernel](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1126679)
    ([1995/02/19/0744122](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE0DD1F39F93AA25751C0A963958260))
    Sometimes, however, Mr. Gore gets carried away in his role as **the
    Scarlet Pimpernel of** *American diplomacy*.
26. [George Washington](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23)
    ([1995/02/19/0744172](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DA143BF93AA25751C0A963958260))
    We Federalists were searching for **a George Washington of** *the
    atomic age* who would inspire nations to yield some of their
    sovereignty, like the states of America, to create a more perfect
    union than the United Nations.
27. [Bill Gates](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5284)
    ([1995/02/19/0744341](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6DA153EF93AA25751C0A963958260))
    They call him **the Bill Gates of** *Japan*.
28. [Tina Turner](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131814)
    ([1995/02/28/0745877](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE4DE133AF93BA15751C0A963958260))
    If Bill Blass has one more season as outstanding as his last two, he
    will have earned the right to be called **the Tina Turner of** *the
    fashion industry*.
29. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([1995/03/05/0746816](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DA1E3AF936A35750C0A963958260))
    But in 1974, Brent Musburger started broadcasting the college
    tournament for CBS and became **the Johnny Appleseed of**
    *alliteration*, using the phrase he had known as a high school
    reporter for the old Chicago American.
30. [Sol Hurok](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4535129)
    ([1995/03/13/0748567](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1DE103FF930A25750C0A963958260))
    Ralph Mercado, now **the Sol Hurok of** *Latin music in New York*,
    did the booking.
31. [Ralph Lauren](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q296647)
    ([1995/03/14/0748676](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE4DC143BF937A25750C0A963958260))
    The shift here from commercial power to the search for the creative
    was most apparent by the turnout for Fabio Piras, another recent St.
    Martin\'s graduate, who scheduled his runway show at the same time
    that Margaret Howell, considered **the Ralph Lauren of** *London*,
    was holding her first runway show in 15 years.
32. [Abdul Sattar Edhi](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q317465)
    ([1995/03/17/0749200](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7D71638F934A25750C0A963958260))
    No -- I\'d rather call Mother Teresa **the Abdul Sattar Edhi of**
    *Calcutta*.
33. [Madonna](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1744)
    ([1995/04/01/0752308](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6D81130F932A35757C0A963958260))
    With her pouting smile, suggestive clothing and theatrical command
    of a microphone, Selena was often described as **the Madonna of**
    *the Mexican-American world* and was an idol and heartthrob on both
    sides of the border.
34. [Madonna](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1744)
    ([1995/04/02/0752494](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1DE163DF931A35757C0A963958260))
    He was **the Madonna of** *his time*, especially by 1969, when he
    guaranteed a Super Bowl victory for his underdog team, and
    delivered.
35. [Homer](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6691)
    ([1995/04/02/0752494](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1DE163DF931A35757C0A963958260))
    Roone Arledge of ABC emerged as **the Homer of** *an enormously
    profitable televised mythology that brought us epic battles in
    slo-mo and instant replay*.
36. [Ralph Nader](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q193156)
    ([1995/04/09/0753814](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1D81738F93AA35757C0A963958260))
    In three hours of stepping in and out of a limousine and in and out
    of restaurants, some fancy, some less so, he was greeted by
    strangers who clearly saw him as a crusader for good in the world,
    **the Ralph Nader of** *food*, Our Man in the Public Dining Room.
37. [Augustine of Hippo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8018)
    ([1995/04/09/0754152](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DC1E3EF93AA35757C0A963958260))
    Now, for most of \"Me Against the World,\" 2Pac comes across as **a
    St. Augustine of** *gangster rap*: after leading a life of sin, he
    wants to steer others away from his own mistakes.
38. [Don King](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q344977)
    ([1995/04/11/0754496](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE3D7133CF932A25757C0A963958260))
    The ritual was like \"being **a Don King for** *the roosters*,\" he
    said, referring to the boxing promoter.
39. [Bill Bradley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q504025)
    ([1995/04/14/0755076](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5DF113AF937A25757C0A963958260))
    Here is Rebecca Lobo, **the Bill Bradley of** *the Nineties*, smart,

    Just a 19-year-old amateur, but disciplined, talented, and a social
    diplomat, Woods may be **the Arthur Ashe of** *the Nineties*.
41. [Paul Gauguin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37693)
    ([1995/04/19/0756313](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE4D7163FF93AA25757C0A963958260))

    ([1995/04/23/0757457](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE0DD173CF930A15757C0A963958260))
    The cause of all this fuss and feathers is that -- brace yourself --
    he fired one agent (the wife of his close friend, the novelist
    Julian Barnes), and hired another, Andrew Wylie, an American now
    referred to in the British papers as \"the Jackal\" and \"**the
    Robert Maxwell of** *agenting*,\" who got him a juicy advance for
    the British edition, rumored to be close to \$800,000.

    In a sense, this is a race to emerge as **the Marshall McLuhan of**
    *the 90\'s*, a popular interpreter of digital technology, the way
    Professor McLuhan served as the sage of the mass media in the
    1960\'s and 70\'s.
45. [Benedict Arnold](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q298237)

    But he has received a barrage of angry electronic-mail messages from
    cyberspace regulars, accusing him, Mr. Stoll says, of being \"**the
    Benedict Arnold of** *the computer world*.\"
46. [Cary Grant](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q83410)

    Siouxsie Sioux (originally Susan Janet Dallion), the leader of
    Siouxsie and the Banshees, is **the Annie Lennox of** *the
    gothic-rock underground*, whose denizens were in full force at
    Roseland in black gowns and capes, black eyeliner, black hair dye
    and white face powder.

    What this agreement tells us is that this Mayor is not **the
    Stonewall Jackson of** *labor relations*, said Edward F. Ott, the
    political director of Local 1180 of the Communications Workers of
    America, which represents about 10,000 city administrative
    employees.

    ([1995/05/14/0762368](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DB1E3BF937A25756C0A963958260))
    But in the last five years it has become something of **a Cinderella
    of** *the siding industry*, swept from its humble beginnings by
    consumer demand for maintenance-free living.
51. [Thomas Edison](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8743)
    ([1995/05/22/0764270](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2D8103FF931A15756C0A963958260))

    ([1995/05/23/0764448](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE0D6163CF930A15756C0A963958260))
    But Fumio Matsuda, who is head of the Japan Automobile Consumers
    Union and is often described as **the Ralph Nader of** *Japan*, said
    officials there simply did not care as much about safety as did
    officials in the United States.

    Walter Winchell, after all, branded his client, Mr. Cassidy, \"**the

56. [Willie Horton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8021572)
    ([1995/06/04/0766855](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE3D71E39F937A35755C0A963958260))
    The Senator seems less interested in evenhandedly addressing a
    cultural crisis than in anointing **a Willie Horton for** *\'96*.
57. [Honoré de Balzac](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9711)
    ([1995/06/11/0768089](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEED6153BF932A25755C0A963958260))
    The novelist who is fast becoming **the Balzac of** *the

    ([1995/06/14/0768829](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DB1E3FF937A25755C0A963958260))
    Long ago, Lindros was anointed by the system, declared to be **the
    Mark Messier of** *the 21st century*, and so his limited
    productivity was the most noticeable.
59. [Joyce Carol Oates](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q217557)
    ([1995/06/18/0769742](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEEDD123EF93BA25755C0A963958260))
    She is a veteran of the last years of Hollywood\'s studio system, an
    Academy Award-winning actress with more than 40 films to her credit,
    a touring hoofer-singer-headliner in her own lounge act, a
    reincarnation advocate who (at least in my local bookstore, where
    the New Age section shelf placards read \"The Unexplained,
    UFO-related, Wicca, Out-of-Body, Shirley MacLaine\") has created a
    whole new area of metaphysical study, and, given that \"My Lucky
    Stars\" is her eighth autobiographical work, she is by now
    practically **the Joyce Carol Oates of** *Hollywood memoirists*.
60. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([1995/06/21/0770285](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DD123DF932A15755C0A963958260))

    These shifts are so quick, yet so dramatic, that one observer has
    called her **the Meryl Streep of** *anchorwomen*.
62. [Ed Sullivan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q83807)
    ([1995/06/25/0771235](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEFD61531F936A15755C0A963958260))

    ([1995/07/02/0772688](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE0D81730F931A35754C0A963958260))
    Gallico, a columnist for The Daily News, was called **the Hemingway
    of** *the sports page* and reportedly was paid more than Grantland
    Rice, Damon Runyon, Westbrook Pegler and other oft-quoted writers.

    Judge Lance A. Ito must feel like **the Dan Quayle of** *the trial
    bench*, condemned by an early negative impression.

    In an opinion article published today in The Los Angeles Times, Mr.
    Jackson wrote that Mr. Wilson was \"**the Susan Smith of** *national

    Mr. Jacobs might be called **the William Safire of** *food writing*,

    Descriptions of Mr. King as \"a street Machiavelli, a ghetto
    Einstein\" and of Muhammad Ali as \"**the Einstein of** *the Sweet
    Science*\" hit the eye like a head-butt, and calling Ali\'s victory
    over George Foreman \"an epic, a miracle, a revolution\" throws
    rhetoric over the event while illuminating nothing.
93. [Walt Disney](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8704)
    ([1995/09/17/0789033](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEFDE113AF934A2575AC0A963958260))

    There are 78 hair salons for men, women or both, including an
    evocatively named pair -- Fantasy of Italy Hair Design just south of
    Dyckman, and Fantastic Unisex at 149th Street -- and the Broadway
    Barber Shop at 104th, where Kay Demetriou, apparently **the Cal
    Ripken of** *barbers*, has not missed a day of snipping and shaving,

    Mr. Ezsterhas, **the Andrew Dice Clay of** *screenwriting*,
    bludgeons the audience with such tirelessly crude thoughts that when
    a group of chimps get loose in the showgirls\' dressing room and all
    they do is defecate, the film enjoys a rare moment of good taste.
98. [Magnus Hirschfeld](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q57592)
    ([1995/09/24/0790586](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6DF173DF937A1575AC0A963958260))
    To the Editor: In his piece on Franz Schreker \[ \"Dastardly Doings
    In Elysium, Lavishly Scored,\" Sept. 3 \] , Jamie James refers to

    context of noting that a Nazi poster had slanderously called
    Schreker \"**the Magnus Hirschfeld of** *opera composers*.\"

    John W. Barr often jokes that his firm, Barr Devlin Associates,
    which is advising the Potomac Electric Power Company in its merger
    with the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company, is **the Rodney
    Dangerfield among** *advisers to the utility industry*.

    ([1995/10/16/0798921](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E3D91039F935A25753C1A963958260))

    Mr. Salinger, a vice chairman of the Burson-Marsteller public
    relations agency, knows or has known everyone -- he\'s **the Toots

    This is incredible, said Chief Scagnelli, the new head of the Police

    For the people who tracked the man known as **a Jesse James among**
    *culture thieves*, nothing makes them happier than the thought of
    Mr. Shumway\'s growing old in prison.
115. [Peter Lynch](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1156395)
    ([1995/11/05/0806816](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E0DC1739F936A35752C1A963958260))
    A former securities lawyer with a perpetually bemused look, he is
    **the Peter Lynch of** *litigation*, a bottom-up, kick-the-tires,
    taste-the-pudding kind of guy who aims to determine how investors
    might profit from pending litigation.
116. [Ross Perot](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q313697)
    ([1995/11/05/0807033](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805E7D91739F936A35752C1A963958260))

    The Likud party leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, has been doing his best
    to paint Yigal Amir, Mr. Rabin\'s assassin, as a lone gunman --
    **the Lee Harvey Oswald of** *Israel*.
118. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([1995/11/08/0807597](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00EFDE1439F93BA35752C1A963958260))
    As the NBC correspondent, John Larson, tells the story, that

    ([1995/11/10/0808051](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3D91439F933A25752C1A963958260))
    It is tempting, but too easy, to think of Ansel Adams as simply
    **the Norman Rockwell of** *landscape photography*: immensely
    popular but critically negligible.
121. [Colin Powell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q150851)
    ([1995/11/12/0808386](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E4DF1539F931A25752C1A963958260))

122. [Lou Gehrig](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q357444)
    ([1995/11/19/0810029](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE6D71239F93AA25752C1A963958260))
    Two years later, in a note to Mr. Carret, he said, \"You are **the

123. [John Travolta](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q80938)
    ([1995/11/20/0810374](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05EEDE1339F933A15752C1A963958260))
    Said Patrick Lang, a World Cup coordinator: \"I\'m sure he would

    In his first two-year term, Mr. Peters, a short, stocky man of 47
    with graying hair and graying mustache, has firmly established
    himself as **the Henny Youngman of** *the mayoral business*, the
    city hall king of the one-liners.
125. [Lord Byron](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5679)
    ([1995/12/03/0812887](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E4D71139F930A35751C1A963958260))
    MADAME, you will live, and you will be **the Lord Byron of**
    *France*,\" Francois-Rene de Chateaubriand wrote prophetically to
    George Sand after reading her novel \"Lelia\" in 1833.
126. [Thomas Edison](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8743)
    ([1995/12/03/0813152](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E1DE1E39F930A35751C1A963958260))
    Clearly, Mr. Gingrich was **the Thomas Edison of** *Gopac*, and he
    was comfortable with the language of the entrepreneurs on his team.
127. [King Kong](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q216810)
    ([1995/12/04/0813441](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE1DB1E39F937A35751C1A963958260))
    Like the light confetti snowfall that caps the 90-minute
    entertainment, this \"Christmas Carol\" lingers in the memory not so
    much for Dickens\'s sentimental sermon on human kindness or for the
    music and lyrics, but rather for the visual candies that abound:
    purple corpses with orange chains flying over the stage, ghosts
    emerging from smoky fireplaces, pale gray tombstones rising against
    the London skyline and **the King Kong of** *turkeys*.
128. [P. D. James](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q270648)
    ([1995/12/10/0815065](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E1D81F39F933A25751C1A963958260))
    Although the author has been called \"**the P. D. James of**
    *Japan*,\" the characters in this psychological suspense tale
    indulge in irrational behavior that would get them committed, if not
    arrested, in a James novel.
129. [Shirley Temple](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q182580)
    ([1995/12/10/0815068](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E0D81F39F933A25751C1A963958260))
    THIS enthralling, heartbreaking book restores to attention Philippa
    Schuyler, child prodigy of the 1930\'s, pianist, composer, Harlem\'s
    Mozart, \"**the Shirley Temple of** *American Negroes*.\"
130. [Jean Auguste Dominique

    *existentialism*\" for his meticulous drawings of anxious figures.
131. [Walter Cronkite](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q31073)
    ([1995/12/18/0816853](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E6DE1439F93BA25751C1A963958260))
    A Growth Industry Orion Samuelson, **the Walter Cronkite of** *farm
    broadcasting*, has come a long way from Green Bay, Wis., where he
    read livestock prices on local TV, to the Tribune Tower in Chicago,
    where he is at the forefront of an increasingly technology-driven
    field.
132. [Jane Austen](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36322)
    ([1995/12/19/0817116](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00EFDC1439F93AA25751C1A963958260))
    The writer Stephen King, noting Mr. Ross\'s gift for character and
    witty dialogue, once called him \"**the Jane Austen of** *the
    political espionage story*.\"
133. [T. R. Knight](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40032)
    ([1995/12/20/0817311](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407EFDA1439F933A15751C1A963958260))
    Maybe He\'s **the 007 of** *Hoops*
134. [Brandon Tartikoff](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2923786)
    ([1995/12/24/0818001](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401EEDD1539F937A15751C1A963958260))
    Now he is in a position roughly equivalent to head of programming at
    a television network or production chief at a movie studio; he finds
    it an apt comparison when it\'s suggested that he might become **the
    Brandon Tartikoff of** *cyber-space*.

    Ms. Kent has become **the Marie Taglioni of** *the 1990\'s*, but
    with spunk, a dancer whose poetic lyricism calls to mind
    descriptions of that great 19th-century ballerina.
62. [James Brown](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5950)
    ([1996/05/08/0849224](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE4DD1539F93BA35756C0A960958260))
    He\'s **the James Brown of** *salsa*, with a tightly choreographed
    set and precise pop arrangements for his tunes.
63. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1996/05/10/0849554](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E0DA1539F933A25756C0A960958260))
    Mr. Burry is **the Michael Jordan of** *integrating insurance and
    health care*, so he commands a pretty big salary, said William
    Silverman, a spokesman for Blue Cross.
64. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([1996/05/14/0850533](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806EEDA1239F937A25756C0A960958260))
    In 1980, three years after he founded the Croquet Association, the
    governing body of the sport in the United States, Mr. Osborn said,
    \"I look forward to the time when I can go from one city to another,
    52 weeks a year, like **the Johnny Appleseed of** *croquet*.\"
65. [Genghis Khan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q720)
    ([1996/05/17/0851153](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE6DD1339F934A25756C0A960958260))
    At the fireside, Mr. Dlamini told the story of Shaka, **the Genghis
    Khan of** *the Zulus*, from his illegitimate birth in a minor clan
    to his leadership of armies that swept southern Africa in the early
    19th century.
66. [Dennis Rodman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q201608)
    ([1996/05/19/0851475](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E3DA1339F93AA25756C0A960958260))
    You could tell she was **the Dennis Rodman of** *mountain biking*.
67. [Donald Trump](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686)
    ([1996/05/19/0851798](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03EED71339F93AA25756C0A960958260))
    Mrs. Benenson, some of whose supporters see her as officious, even
    imperious, expresses responsibility to the tranquil oasis created in
    1831 by Samuel Ruggles, **a Trump of** *his time*.
68. [Golda Meir](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q42992)
    ([1996/05/21/0852275](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504EFDC1039F932A15756C0A960958260))
    Some people say Claire Shulman is **the Golda Meir of** *Queens*,
    said John S. Dyson, the outgoing Deputy Mayor for Economic
    Development and Finance, responsible for cultural financing.
69. [Claire Shulman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5125309)
    ([1996/05/21/0852275](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504EFDC1039F932A15756C0A960958260))
    I say Golda Meir was **the Claire Shulman of** *Israel*.
70. [Charlie Brown](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1168491)
    ([1996/05/26/0853475](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E6D91139F935A15756C0A960958260))
    Still, this is New Jersey, **the Charlie Brown of** *franchises*,
    where high expectations get tangled like a kite in a tree, where
    \"good grief\" is a normal post-game comment.
71. [John Robinson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q723274)
    ([1996/05/28/0853767](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E6D61139F93BA15756C0A960958260))
    If I could be remembered as **the John Robinson of** *my
    generation*, he said, \"that would be high praise.\"
72. [Adlai Stevenson I](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q310839)
    ([1996/06/02/0854862](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06E4DF1F39F931A35755C0A960958260))
    It should have been no great surprise that a significant majority of
    Israeli Jews would vote their fears in an anxious time, finding Mr.
    Peres, whose aloofness and political stumbles make him **the Adlai
    Stevenson of** *Israeli politics*, less credible on the issue that
    mattered most to them: security.
73. [Paul Revere](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q327071)
    ([1996/06/02/0855013](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CEFDE1F39F931A35755C0A960958260))
    In his role as **the Paul Revere for** *demographic dangers*, Mr.

    ([1996/06/09/0856237](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE3DB1639F93AA35755C0A960958260))
    He\'s **the Ross Perot of** *East Hampton*, said Bruce Moore, owner
    of Bruce\'s Seafood market.
75. [Thomas Edison](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8743)
    ([1996/06/09/0856351](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DA1639F93AA35755C0A960958260))
    It said that since there seems to be a general consensus that Gates
    is **the Edison of** *his day*, you ought to hit him up for money.
76. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([1996/06/12/0857201](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E4DB1739F931A25755C0A960958260))
    I call Lexmark **the Rodney Dangerfield of** *printer companies*,
    said Steve Milunovich, an analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company, which
    co-managed the company\'s November offering.
77. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([1996/06/12/0857282](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403E1D6173EF931A25755C0A960958260))
    I call Lexmark **the Rodney Dangerfield of** *printer
    companies*,\'\' said Steve Milunovich, an analyst at Morgan Stanley
    & Company, which co-managed the company\'s November offering.
78. [Robert Moses](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1111386)
    ([1996/06/13/0857512](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06EFDA1739F930A25755C0A960958260))
    Whatever their origin, it is unlikely the walks came about without
    the permission, if not the involvement, of William H. Reynolds,
    **the Robert Moses of** *Long Beach*.
79. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1996/06/14/0857634](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE7D81739F937A25755C0A960958260))
    He said he would bid on free agents \"if **the Michael Jordan of**
    *hockey*\" becomes available.
80. [Virgil](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1398)
    ([1996/06/16/0858002](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DEFDF1439F935A25755C0A960958260))
    A historian and journalist by training, he has nonetheless striven
    for years to bear witness to Montana history in fiction, and to
    become if not the Homer at least **the Virgil of** *generations of
    Scots who migrated to northwestern Montana before and after it
    became a state in 1889*.
81. [P. T. Barnum](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766)
    ([1996/06/23/0859503](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504EFDB1539F930A15755C0A960958260))
    But Kevin J. Kinsella, known as **the P. T. Barnum of** *biotech*,
    has come very close to living the myth.
82. [Christopher Columbus](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7322)
    ([1996/06/26/0860266](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E0DD1239F935A15755C0A960958260))
    Our goal is to be **the Christopher Columbus of** *doner*.\"
83. [Millard Fillmore](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12306)
    ([1996/06/26/0860364](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DC1239F935A15755C0A960958260))
    Ayh lived only a few more years and seems to have been **the Millard
    Fillmore of** *Pharoahs*.
84. [Thurgood Marshall](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q312348)
    ([1996/07/03/0862081](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07EED61339F930A35754C0A960958260))
    Her decision, in fact, can be read in several ways, and not all of
    the interpretations are easy to reconcile with the vision of
    equal-treatment feminism that she championed as **the Thurgood
    Marshall of** *the women\'s movement in the 1970\'s*.
85. [John Barrymore](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q95034)
    ([1996/07/05/0862461](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE0DC1039F936A35754C0A960958260))
    FOR most of this century, the Hudson has been **the John Barrymore
    of** *rivers*, noble in profile but a sorry wreck.
86. [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([1996/07/06/0862685](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E7D91039F935A35754C0A960958260))
    Precious is her name, but at the plate she is the power lady, **the
    Babe Ruth of** *a no-nonsense league*.
87. [Paul Revere](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q327071)
    ([1996/07/06/0862725](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E5DB1E39F935A35754C0A960958260))
    Ms. Turock, 59, blond, with a voice like honey, has been called
    \"**the Paul Revere of** *the Information Age*\" by the Librarian of
    Congress, James Billington.
88. [Thomas Jefferson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11812)
    ([1996/07/09/0863379](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E4DC1139F93AA35754C0A960958260))
    And I guess you could say Frank Thomas is **the Thomas Jefferson
    of** *baseball*.\"
89. [Sam Walton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q497827)
    ([1996/07/14/0864251](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E6DD1E39F937A25754C0A960958260))
    Though little known to the general public, Dobson is **the Sam
    Walton of** *the family values movement*, a distributor with
    unparalleled reach.
90. [Mark Twain](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7245)
    ([1996/07/21/0866407](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE1D61F39F932A15754C0A960958260))
    The image I always have is, this is a river town, and he\'s like
    **the Mark Twain of** *early music*.
91. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([1996/07/25/0867025](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E7DF1739F936A15754C0A960958260))
    meetings and bridge parties, folding chairs, **the Rodney
    Dangerfield of** *the home-furnishings world*, are stashed in a
    closet when not in use.
92. [Michael Johnson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q190924)
    ([1996/07/27/0867603](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07EEDA1739F934A15754C0A960958260))
    Godina, competing in his first Games, considered himself **the
    Michael Johnson of** *shot-putters*.
93. [Frank Gifford](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1261570)
    ([1996/07/28/0867931](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE4D61739F93BA15754C0A960958260))
    There were potshots at other commentators, most notably John Tesh,
    whom Todd called \"**the Frank Gifford of** *gymnastics*.
94. [Margaret Thatcher](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7416)
    ([1996/07/31/0868645](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E1DA1439F932A05754C0A960958260))
    For Benjamin Netanyahu, the conservative new Prime Minister, cutting
    those subsidies and slashing that work force rank high in a quest to
    become **the Margaret Thatcher of** *Israel*.
95. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1996/08/03/0869199](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06EEDD103FF930A3575BC0A960958260))
    And, of course, **the Michael Jordan of** *Brazilian basketball for
    the past 20 years*, has simply been known as Oscar.
96. [Michael Johnson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q190924)
    ([1996/08/04/0869687](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03EEDF1E3FF937A3575BC0A960958260))
    It\'s one thing to win a gold medal, but the way he dominated, he
    was **the Michael Johnson of** *the tennis field* today.\'\'
97. [Martha Stewart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234606)
    ([1996/08/05/0869846](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E5DD163EF936A3575BC0A960958260))
    And like **a Martha Stewart of** *the classroom*, she had tips for
    any occasion: dividing up the teachers for an exercise, she noted
    that a quick way to place children in groups is to deal out a deck
    of cards and then call out a grouping based on cards drawn.
98. [King Kong](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2171232)
    ([1996/08/08/0870148](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E2DB143EF93BA3575BC0A960958260))
    CLIFF is tethered at three angles, **a King Kong among**
    *Rottweilers*.
99. [Charlie Parker](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103767)
    ([1996/08/09/0870295](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E4DF123EF93AA3575BC0A960958260))
    But for all its admiration, \'\'Basquiat\'\' winds up no closer to
    that assessment than to the critic Robert Hughes\'s more jaundiced
    one: \'\'Far from being **the Charlie Parker of** *SoHo* (as his
    promoters claimed), he became its Jessica Savitch.\'\'
100. [Aesop](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q43423)
    ([1996/08/09/0870300](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E0DF123EF93AA3575BC0A960958260))
    Eric Rohmer\'s \'\'Rendezvous in Paris\'\' is an oasis of
    contemplative intelligence in the summer movie season, presenting
    three graceful and elegant parables with the moral agility that
    distinguishes Mr. Rohmer as **the Aesop of** *amour*.
101. [Billy Graham](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213550)
    ([1996/08/09/0870316](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E1DC123EF93AA3575BC0A960958260))
    As in the past, the preponderance are Venetian pictures: Tiepolos,
    Guardis, Canalettos and a Jacopo Bellini that is surgically precise,
    and movingly so: a small depiction of the sallow, toothless and
    hollow-eyed St. Bernardino of Siena, who as a popular preacher was
    something like **the Billy Graham of** *Bellini\'s day*.
102. [Cinderella](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q13685096)
    ([1996/08/11/0870605](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E0DA163EF932A2575BC0A960958260))
    The scullery maid was the lowest position,\'\' Ms. Maher said,
    \'\'like **the Cinderella of** *the place*.\'\'
103. [Ayn Rand](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q132524)
    ([1996/08/11/0870785](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E2DA133EF932A2575BC0A960958260))
    That would probably be bearable if the books weren\'t getting
    progressively less readable; but she\'s **the Ayn Rand of** *the
    spirit realm*.
104. [Michelangelo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5592)
    ([1996/08/13/0871265](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03EFDF1731F930A2575BC0A960958260))
    The people who ran things four years ago are out, and people who
    made Republican images in happier days are back -- people like
    Michael J. Deaver, **the Michelangelo of** *the balloon drop*, and
    the joint impresarios here, William I. Greener 3d and Paul J.
    Manafort, who both made their names in the 1980\'s, heyday of Ronald
    Reagan.
105. [Oprah Winfrey](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q55800)
    ([1996/08/16/0871746](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E3DB1E31F935A2575BC0A960958260))
    They bemoaned its dearth of fresh ideas and its reliance on the
    technological and dramatic capabilities of television, epitomized by
    Elizabeth Dole\'s performance as **the Oprah Winfrey of**
    *nominating night*.
106. [Jimi Hendrix](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5928)
    ([1996/08/19/0872309](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E7DC1730F93AA2575BC0A960958260))
    He even tried to be **the Jimi Hendrix of** *the harp*, performing a
    distorted solo version of \'\'The Star-Spangled Banner,\'\' complete
    with modulated feedback.
107. [Jim Carrey](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40504)
    ([1996/08/22/0872803](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6D81030F931A1575BC0A960958260))
    America\'s flashiest extrovert, **the Jim Carrey of** *capitalism*,
    has gone existential on us.
108. [Tommy Hilfiger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q136687)
    ([1996/08/25/0873205](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E6DB1639F936A1575BC0A960958260))
    We consider Mossimo **the Tommy Hilfiger of** *Generation X*.\'\'
109. [Jack Kemp](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q357676)
    ([1996/08/25/0873229](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E1DC1739F936A1575BC0A960958260))
    Throw in his stocky build and silvery hair, and Mr. Mandl comes
    across almost like **a Jack Kemp for** *the Rotary Club crowd*.
110. [John Grisham](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q106465)
    ([1996/08/25/0873390](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403E7D71530F936A1575BC0A960958260))
    And this was before, of course, I knew that Jane Austen was going to
    turn out to be **the John Grisham of** *the Romantic novel set*.\'\'
111. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([1996/08/25/0873426](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE1DD1330F936A1575BC0A960958260))
    But alas, **the Rodney Dangerfield of** *Saddle River* got no
    enduring respect from the Clintons.
112. [Betsy Ross](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234952)
    ([1996/08/26/0873568](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE3D61439F935A1575BC0A960958260))
    Sometimes called **the Betsy Ross of** *the personal computer*, Ms.
    Kare did path-breaking work on the original Macintosh in the early
    1980\'s, including the image of a miniature Mac with a smiley face
    that greets users when the machine is turned on, and the trash can.
113. [Ravi Shankar](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103774)

    ([1997/01/18/0902375](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1DC143BF93BA25752C0A961958260))
    It also isn\'t known why the local Shona people weren\'t living in
    cities when the hunter-explorer Adam Renders arrived in 1868,
    although this slice of Africa was in turmoil from droughts, disease,
    slavers and invasions by whites and by rival tribes fleeing the
    fierce empire-building of Shaka, **the Attila of** *Zululand*,
    hundreds of miles to the south.
10. [Clint Eastwood](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q43203)
    ([1997/01/26/0904614](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02EEDA123AF935A15752C0A961958260))
    As Mr. Dowlin arrived in San Francisco nine years ago, a local
    newspaper columnist suggested that the city would need **the Clint
    Eastwood of** *librarians* to deal with its lawless athenaeum.
11. [Bob Dylan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q392)
    ([1997/01/30/0905330](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E5DD163DF933A05752C0A961958260))
    In the late 1960\'s and early 70\'s, the English folk and rock
    singer Roy Harper was set to burst out of the underground and become
    **the Bob Dylan of** *the United Kingdom*.
12. [Perry Como](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q333405)
    ([1997/01/31/0905488](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E0D7173DF932A05752C0A961958260))
    Kenny G. (whose last name is Gorelick) is **the Perry Como of**
    *saxophonists*, a crooner of comforting melodies, the musical
    equivalent of warm milk.
13. [Eddie Vedder](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q221535)
    ([1997/02/09/0907512](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E7D91E3DF93AA35751C0A961958260))
    On the stark black-and-white cover of his next album, he is seen
    hunched over, staring grimly; its songs bemoaned his fame, making
    him **the Eddie Vedder of** *his day*.
14. [Chris Mullin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q289398)
    ([1997/02/10/0907989](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E2DA103CF933A25751C0A961958260))
    He was going to be St. John\'s savior of the 90\'s, **the Chris
    Mullin of** *color*, except that Lopez\'s jump shot was never as
    feathery and he had no way of knowing that the tribe he was joining
    was about to be leveled by storm.
15. [Don Mattingly](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q679120)
    ([1997/02/15/0909011](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E4DC123FF936A25751C0A961958260))
    Kyle Clifton, a gifted middle linebacker who never realized his
    dream of helping the Jets win a championship -- **a Don Mattingly
    of** *sorts*, in a helmet and shoulder pads -- announced his
    retirement yesterday after spending 13 seasons in the National
    Football League.
16. [Shelby Foote](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q714250)
    ([1997/02/16/0909196](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4DC1E3CF935A25751C0A961958260))
    I gradually began to conjure up the image of Joseph Ellis as **the
    Shelby Foote of** *the film*, recalling that sales of Mr. Foote\'s
    books had gone up exponentially after his bravura performance in the
    landmark Burns film on the Civil War.
17. [Lana Turner](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q201034)
    ([1997/02/16/0909383](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507EEDD153FF935A25751C0A961958260))
    This is **the Lana Turner of** *the 1990\'s*?
18. [Typhoid Mary](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q238948)
    ([1997/02/16/0909447](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01EEDF133FF935A25751C0A961958260))
    And unlike Riley, he isn\'t trying to divert us with Hamptons hair
    and Soho suits while he babbles pop sports psych (ironically, Riley
    may have been **the Typhoid Mary of** *the Knicks\' \'\'Disease of
    Me\'\'*) that distances all messages.
19. [Wynton Marsalis](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q273076)
    ([1997/02/16/0909448](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E7DE133FF935A25751C0A961958260))
    Cornicelli, who is a masterful caller, honked like **the Wynton
    Marsalis of** *goose hunting*.
20. [Regis Philbin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q463673)
    ([1997/02/17/0909645](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804E1DA103FF934A25751C0A961958260))
    Some of this, of course, stems from the fact that 1996 was **the
    Regis Philbin of** *recent campaigns*: politics was omnipresent but
    so bland as to pass unnoticed.
21. [Harold Stassen](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q887520)
    ([1997/02/18/0909767](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E2DD113FF93BA25751C0A961958260))
    He\'s **the Harold Stassen of** *Daytona*.
22. [Pablo Picasso](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5593)
    ([1997/02/23/0910736](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7D81E3FF930A15751C0A961958260))
    Bihzad was one: the Raphael, the Rembrandt, **the Picasso of**
    *Persia in his day*, the artist whose name was synonymous with art
    itself.
23. [Paul Gauguin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37693)
    ([1997/02/23/0910763](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02E4DB163EF930A15751C0A961958260))
    Now she is **the Gauguin of** *Great Neck*.
24. [Oprah Winfrey](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q55800)
    ([1997/02/23/0910902](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504E4D8123EF930A15751C0A961958260))
    He was apparently forgetting that Ms. Winfrey is already **the Oprah
    Winfrey of** *literature*.
25. [Rosa Parks](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41921)
    ([1997/03/03/0913050](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7D71F31F930A35750C0A961958260))
    Ms. Haley said she found herself contemplating the contrast between
    such derisive comments with the more common praise for her mother,
    whom experts called **the Rosa Parks of** *the affordable housing
    movement*.
26. [Joe Namath](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q720558)
    ([1997/03/09/0914501](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE6D91E30F93AA35750C0A961958260))
    It\'s not just winning for us,\'\' said Mr. Sherwood, who has begun
    to fancy himself **the Joe Namath of** *bid whist*.
27. [Rosa Parks](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41921)
    ([1997/03/19/0916691](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E6DD1138F93AA25750C0A961958260))
    Considered **the Rosa Parks of** *Cheyenne\'s anti-bomb movement*,
    Mrs. Laybourn was the lone voice of protest over the arrival of
    Atlas missiles at Warren\'s nuclear command in 1958.
28. [Bill Clinton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1124)
    ([1997/03/23/0917392](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E6D81139F930A15750C0A961958260))
    The story of \'\'Dashing Sally,\'\' as Mr. Ellis writes, is \'\'the
    longest-running mini-series in American history\'\' -- making
    Jefferson **the Bill Clinton of** *his time*.
29. [Cornelius Ryan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q463975)
    ([1997/03/23/0917504](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5DB1E38F930A15750C0A961958260))
    He might be called **the Cornelius Ryan of** *the Civil War*,
    producing the same sort of history-as-drama Ryan created with World
    War II books like \'\'The Longest Day\'\' and \'\'A Bridge Too
    Far.\'\'
30. [Ernest Hemingway](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23434)
    ([1997/03/27/0918474](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02E2DC163AF934A15750C0A961958260))
    They were led by Ms. O\'Neill, **the Ernest Hemingway of** *bargain
    hunters*, whose militarily precise organizational abilities cause
    her husband to describe her as \'\'a force of nature.\'\'
31. [Michelangelo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5592)
    ([1997/03/29/0918913](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E7DD133AF93AA15750C0A961958260))
    And when he\'s referred to as **the Michelangelo of** *coaching*, I
    really think that\'s a very appropriate term.\'\'
32. [Ed McMahon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q555370)
    ([1997/04/06/0920768](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03EED91F3AF935A35757C0A961958260))
    Hank, **the Ed McMahon of** *the fictional talk show at the center
    of HBO\'s popular \'\'Larry Sanders Show,\'\'* suddenly became a
    devout Jew in one episode and angered his colleagues by insisting on
    wearing a yarmulke.
33. [Leslie Caron](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q230023)
    ([1997/04/13/0922363](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E5D6143CF930A25757C0A961958260))
    I would have a beautiful little atelier, meet **the Leslie Caron
    of** *my life*, sit in a cafe and meet artists.
34. [Bill Gates](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5284)
    ([1997/04/13/0922555](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E4D8103CF930A25757C0A961958260))
    This remarkable man became **the Bill Gates of** *his era* by
    electrifying streetcars, and went on to invent the railroad air
    brake system used today, and the modern elevator.
35. [Andy Warhol](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5603)
    ([1997/04/13/0922638](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401EFDF1E3CF930A25757C0A961958260))
    In blue slacks, polo-style shirt and white sneakers, Mr. Harris
    looks more like an off-duty accountant than **the Andy Warhol of**
    *Silicon Alley*, New York\'s new-media mecca.
36. [George Burns](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q344793)
    ([1997/04/15/0922983](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE1DD163FF936A25757C0A961958260))
    That is not to say that Dr. Mayr cannot be charming, even pointedly
    humble, making practiced jokes about himself and his age, sounding
    like **the George Burns of** *evolutionary biology*.
37. [Jackie Robinson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q221048)
    ([1997/04/19/0923823](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE5DC1E3FF93AA25757C0A961958260))
    But the 21-year-old who is often described as **the Jackie Robinson
    of** *golf* blew off Jackie Robinson -- and the Fan in Chief.
38. [Leonardo da Vinci](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q762)
    ([1997/04/20/0924355](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E7DF163EF933A15757C0A961958260))
    Mr. Fuente is widely considered **a da Vinci of** *the art car
    movement*.
39. [Ernie Banks](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3051017)
    ([1997/04/20/0924364](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805E3DD163EF933A15757C0A961958260))
    On Sunday, he would like to become **the Ernie Banks of** *soccer*
    with a let\'s-play-two approach to a doubleheader in Foxboro, Mass.
40. [Tiger Woods](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q10993)
    ([1997/04/20/0924370](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1DB163EF933A15757C0A961958260))
    Some want to bill her as **the Tiger Woods of** *the L.P.G.A.*
41. [Nolan Ryan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q721948)
    ([1997/04/23/0924920](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE5DC133EF930A15757C0A961958260))
    Yanks Obtain Rights to Irabu After weeks of negotiations, New York
    acquired the rights to pitcher Hideki Irabu, who has been called
    **the Nolan Ryan of** *Japan*.
42. [Eugene O\'Neill](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q93157)
    ([1997/04/27/0925650](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DD123EF934A15757C0A961958260))
    Theater columnists called him \'\'**the O\'Neill of** *the
    30\'s*.\'\'
43. [Mahatma Gandhi](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1001)
    ([1997/04/30/0926511](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806EFD61331F933A05757C0A961958260))
    He\'s become **the Gandhi of** *Cuba*..\'\'
44. [P. T. Barnum](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766)
    ([1997/05/02/0926963](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE4D71F31F931A35756C0A961958260))
    As Doby tells it, Veeck was more than just **the P. T. Barnum of**
    *baseball*, more than just exploding scoreboards and novelty acts,
    despite the indelible image of the midget Eddie Gaedel at bat.
45. [Jil Sander](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q69066)
    ([1997/05/06/0927940](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06E2DE1330F935A35756C0A961958260))
    It\'s **the Jil Sander of** *bridal* versus the Christian Lacroix of
    bridal.\'\'
46. [Christian Lacroix](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q350844)
    ([1997/05/06/0927940](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06E2DE1330F935A35756C0A961958260))
    It\'s the Jil Sander of bridal versus **the Christian Lacroix of**
    *bridal*.\'\'
47. [Dennis Rodman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q201608)
    ([1997/05/11/0929079](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE5D71239F932A25756C0A961958260))
    Naturally, he likes Howard Stern, **the Rodman of** *radio*, much
    more than he likes David Stern, the National Basketball Association
    daddy figure, who will eventually be judged by how well he controls
    the stars who test him; maybe those box-office Roman candles needed
    hugs and spankings earlier.
48. [Knute Rockne](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1770885)
    ([1997/05/25/0932244](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E2D9153BF936A15756C0A961958260))
    Sexton was **the Knute Rockne of** *debate*.
49. [Mr. Chips](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3268056)
    ([1997/05/25/0932244](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E2D9153BF936A15756C0A961958260))
    He might well have spent his life as **the Mr. Chips of**
    *Brooklyn*, but in 1974 he applied to law school and accepted at
    Harvard after Laurence Tribe, an old friend from his debating days,
    intervened.
50. [Tiger Woods](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q10993)
    ([1997/05/25/0932541](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E0D81E3BF936A15756C0A961958260))
    Or if you could, find **the Tiger Woods of** *auto racing*: someone
    who could capture the public\'s attention,\'\' he said.
51. [Hubert Humphrey](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q209989)
    ([1997/05/26/0932624](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E2DE1F3BF935A15756C0A961958260))
    I\'m taking my watch off because we\'re on a very tight schedule and
    I have the reputation of being **the Hubert Humphrey of** *the
    Republican Party*.
52. [James Bond](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2009573)
    ([1997/06/01/0933674](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E4D7153BF932A35755C0A961958260))
    The marathon culminates Sunday/ Early Monday at 2:30 A.M. with
    \'\'Tarzan and the Jungle Boy,\'\' a 1968 epic starring the sleek
    Mike Henry, billed as **the James Bond of** *the ape men*.
53. [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254)
    ([1997/06/01/0933739](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6D9153AF932A35755C0A961958260))
    Edison was **the Mozart of** *invention*, at a time that was the
    heyday of American inventors.\'\'
54. [Anwar el Sadat](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q42013)
    ([1997/06/04/0934646](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06EFD6133DF937A35755C0A961958260))
    And Mr. Scruggs describes Mr. Myers as \'\'**the Anwar Sadat of**
    *the public health community*.\'\'

    ([1997/06/06/0934955](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE4D91E3DF935A35755C0A961958260))
    The complex aural and visual style of \'\'The Pillow Book\'\'
    involves rectangular insets that flash back to Sei Shonagon (a kind
    of Windows 995) and illustrate the imperious little lists that made
    her sound like **the Diana Vreeland of** *10th-century tastes*.
56. [Jerry Della Femina](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6183474)
    ([1997/06/08/0935419](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E2DB103DF93BA35755C0A961958260))
    He is becoming **the Jerry Della Femina of** *the western Hamptons*.
57. [Tiger Woods](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q10993)
    ([1997/06/09/0935919](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E6D8123CF93AA35755C0A961958260))
    Jeff Gordon is considered **the Tiger Woods of** *Nascar*, if only
    for his success at a relatively young age (25).
58. [Cal Ripken](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q731168)
    ([1997/06/14/0936888](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E0DB123FF937A25755C0A961958260))

    Thalassa Cruso, an authority on plants who was known as \'\'**the
    Julia Child of** *horticulture*\'\' for her common-sense if often
    loopy gardening programs on television in the 1960\'s, died on June
    11 at Newton and Wellesley Alzheimer Center in Wellesley, Mass.
61. [Faust](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q76918)

    Jacques Chirac -- that guy is **the Janet Reno of** *diplomacy*.
113. [Isaac Newton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q935)
    ([1997/10/15/0965140](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E6DC1139F936A25753C1A961958260))
    Bob Merton is **the Isaac Newton of** *his field*,\'\' Mr. Samuelson
    said.
114. [Joe DiMaggio](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q297142)
    ([1997/10/16/0965519](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E7DC153FF935A25753C1A961958260))
    He was **the Joe DiMaggio of** *legislators*,\'\' said his friend
    Thomas Lyons, the chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party.
115. [Tiger Woods](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q10993)
    ([1997/10/19/0966116](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E5D6163FF93AA25753C1A961958260))
    When will we see **the Tiger Woods of** *skiing* make an appearance?
116. [Al Sharpton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q380433)
    ([1997/10/19/0966241](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE3D9123FF93AA25753C1A961958260))
    He\'s **the Al Sharpton of** *his people, of the Asian Indian
    community*,\'\' said Officer Allen A. Sabo, of the Edison Police
    Department.
117. [George Lucas](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q38222)
    ([1997/10/20/0966567](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E1DC1F3FF933A15753C1A961958260))
    He is, in fact, quickly becoming **the George Lucas of** *a business
    that is capturing an increasingly mainstream following*.
118. [Goddard Lieberson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5576257)
    ([1997/10/26/0967785](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E1DD123FF935A15753C1A961958260))
    He has said the compliment he most cherishes is one that called him
    \'\'**the Goddard Lieberson of** *publishing*\'\' -- a reference to
    the president of Columbia Records who in the 1950\'s helped pioneer
    the recording of Broadway musicals and spoken word, spurred John
    Hammond\'s talent scouting and supported the signing of the
    blacklisted Pete Seeger, among other accomplishments.
119. [Albert Einstein](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q937)
    ([1997/10/29/0968855](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00EED71231F93AA15753C1A961958260))
    This has nothing and everything to do with Charles Barkley, **the
    Einstein of** *the Houston Rockets*, who was not enraptured with a
    man at a bar in Orlando, Fla., the other night and, by witnesses\'
    account, picked him up and threw him like a football through a
    plate-glass window.
120. [Robin Hood](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7352498)
    ([1997/11/04/0970453](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E5D61230F937A35752C1A961958260))
    This national logo is the brainchild of John Krimsky, the deputy
    secretary general of the U.S.O.C., who sees himself as **the Robin
    Hood for** *obscure biathletes, fencers and other endangered Olympic
    species*.
121. [Dorothy Parker](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q270707)
    ([1997/11/07/0971103](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02E6DA1639F934A35752C1A961958260))
    Syd Straw has long been **the Dorothy Parker of** *the downtown club
    world*, her self-deprecating charm and zany antics in counterpart to
    one of the biggest hearts and warmest voices in New York.
122. [Mother Teresa](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30547)
    ([1997/11/10/0972068](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E3DA1339F933A25752C1A961958260))
    In his homily yesterday, the Cardinal said he had received many
    letters as the centennial of Miss Day\'s birth drew near, one from a
    supporter who called her \'\'**the Mother Teresa of** *Mott
    Street*.\'\'
123. [George Hamilton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q359416)
    ([1997/11/12/0972502](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02EEDF1F39F931A25752C1A961958260))
    But on the other hand, he was **the George Hamilton of** *the
    Senate*, spending so much time bronzing on his Capitol balcony that
    it was dubbed \'\'Dole\'s Beach.\'\'
124. [Iggy Pop](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q182665)
    ([1997/11/14/0972790](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E3DA1738F937A25752C1A961958260))
    Tribe 8 is a self-proclaimed lesbian punk band whose lead singer
    Lynn Breedlove is **the Iggy Pop of** *the 1990\'s*: a shocking,
    brilliant performer in leather pants and no shirt, the definition of
    transgressive freedom.
125. [Rudolph Valentino](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q188692)
    ([1997/11/16/0973323](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E7DD1E39F935A25752C1A961958260))
    After his smoldering performance in \'\'The Mambo Kings\'\' in 1992,
    the Spanish-born actor was touted as **a Rudolph Valentino for**
    *the 90\'s*.
126. [Woody Allen](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q25089)
    ([1997/11/18/0973929](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE2DB1138F93BA25752C1A961958260))
    This exceptionally funny and clever episode of the series, about an
    intellectual named Maya (Laura San Giacomo) who works for her
    philistine father (George Segal) at a fashion magazine called Blush,
    is shaped as an \'\'Annie Hall\'\' parody and features a character
    who looks, talks and acts like **the Woody Allen of** *Maya\'s
    dreams*.
127. [Napoleon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q517)
    ([1997/11/23/0975066](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEFD8163BF930A15752C1A961958260))
    More memorable was **the Napoleon of** *vegetables* enlivened with
    preserved tomatoes and mustard leaves.
128. [George Clooney](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23844)
    ([1997/11/23/0975244](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6D8123BF930A15752C1A961958260))
    Call her **the George Clooney of** *26th Street*, but the Nikon-shy
    Sunday morning merchant may have a right to her hauteur.
129. [Julia Child](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q214477)
    ([1997/11/26/0975833](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E0DA163AF935A15752C1A961958260))
    Though she has some valuable old cookbooks -- including those by
    Isabella Beeton and Mrs. H. W. Beecher, **the Julia Childs of** *the
    mid-19th century* -- Ms. Slotnick\'s books are mainly 20th-century
    American volumes that are now out of print.
130. [Susan Lucci](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q242936)
    ([1997/12/02/0977304](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E0D9163DF931A35751C1A961958260))
    Since then, in almost every season, 14 of them in all, everyone has
    wondered, is this the year the A.F.C., **the Susan Lucci of**
    *football*, ends the streak?
131. [Paul Brown](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q968798)
    ([1997/12/07/0978705](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E2DE1F3DF934A35751C1A961958260))
    Jim Leyland is becoming **the Paul Brown of** *baseball managers*.
132. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([1997/12/08/0978823](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E3D71F3DF93BA35751C1A961958260))
    But if Mr. Dunifer\'s advocates see him as a free-speech crusader
    and **the Johnny Appleseed of** *low-power radio*, the F.C.C., the
    legal guardian of the common property of the airwaves, sees him as a
    radio \'\'pirate\'\' who is breaking the law, disrupting licensed
    broadcasters and posing a threat to public safety.
133. [Annie Osborn](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21847069)
    ([1997/12/09/0978983](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E2DA143DF93AA35751C1A961958260))
    But in a social season that crams 300 benefits into three months,
    turning City Opera\'s gala, a lavish dinner following a new
    production of \'\'Macbeth,\'\' into **a Cinderella of**
    *fund-raisers* took more than the wave of a wand.
134. [Ralph Lauren](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q296647)
    ([1997/12/11/0979456](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E2D8123CF932A25751C1A961958260))
    I\'m **the Ralph Lauren of** *Christmas*.\'\'
135. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([1997/12/12/0979823](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01EFD7113CF931A25751C1A961958260))
    IT is probably being way too glib to describe hepatitis B as **the
    Rodney Dangerfield of** *major infectious diseases*.
136. [William Shakespeare](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q692)
    ([1997/12/14/0980053](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06EFD7163CF937A25751C1A961958260))
    Viscount Melchoir de Vogue, a Frenchman, agreed, and regarded
    Dostoyevsky as its warden: \'\'He is **the Shakespeare of** *the
    lunatic asylum*.\'\'
137. [Bob Dole](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q319079)
    ([1997/12/14/0980084](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805E4D9143CF937A25751C1A961958260))
    Shimon Peres had already failed three times in national elections
    and, given his age and lifetime in politics, was perceived as **the
    Bob Dole of** *Israeli politics*.
138. [Lech Wałęsa](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q444)
    ([1997/12/21/0982159](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE7D9163EF932A15751C1A961958260))
    True, he is a legendary figure, **a Lech Walesa of** *Korea*, and
    his victory immediately made history, since it was the first time an
    opposition candidate was ever elected president in the country.
139. [Annie Oakley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q230935)
    ([1997/12/24/0982708](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7D6123EF937A15751C1A961958260))
    Running nearly as long as \'\'Pulp Fiction\'\' even though its
    ambitions are more familiar and small, \'\'Jackie Brown\'\' has the
    makings of another, chattier \'\'Get Shorty\'\' with an added homage
    to Pam Grier, **the Annie Oakley of** *1970\'s blaxploitation*.
140. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1997/12/26/0983138](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E0D91E3EF935A15751C1A961958260))
    No one wants his autograph, and no one asks him if he thinks of
    himself as **the Michael Jordan of** *tennis*, a question that makes
    Sampras lose his appetite wherever and whenever it is asked.
141. [Henry Ford](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8768)
    ([1997/12/28/0983749](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E3DB1731F93BA15751C1A961958260))
    Called **the Henry Ford of** *housing*, he spurned unions to
    organize an army of 15,000 workers into dozens of specialized crews,
    including one to apply red paint and another, white.
142. [Wynton Marsalis](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q273076)
    ([1997/12/29/0983855](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E4D71731F93AA15751C1A961958260))
    Moreover, Mr. Mosley is a kind of jazz musician, **a Wynton Marsalis
    of** *the printed page*, his themes subtly, obliquely, quietly
    stated, almost imperceptibly bubbling up from the rhythms of
    ordinary life.
143. [Studs Terkel](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q529276)
    ([1997/12/31/0984216](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E6DD1331F932A05751C1A961958260))
    A prolific writer of prose and poetry, he has also been called by
    literary critics **the Studs Terkel of** *Sicily*, although Mr.
    Dolci was the first of the two to chronicle the lives of workers.

1998 {#section-12}
----

1.  [Dwight D. Eisenhower](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9916)
    ([1998/01/01/0984416](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E0D81031F932A35752C0A96E958260))
    He reacted angrily to charges that he had become a caretaker chief
    executive, coasting toward retirement on a surging economy, **the
    Dwight Eisenhower of** *the baby boomers*.
2.  [Annie Oakley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q230935)
    ([1998/01/02/0984556](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E6D71131F931A35752C0A96E958260))
    Ms. Grier, **the Annie Oakley of** *1970\'s blaxploitation films*,
    makes a game comeback even if she struggles with the story\'s
    ensemble loafing.
3.  [Greta Garbo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5443)
    ([1998/01/03/0984733](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E0D71F31F930A35752C0A96E958260))
    Reclusive by nature and dubbed **the Garbo of** *the tennis tour* by
    Alice Marble, one of the many opponents who felt ignored by her,
    Wills nonetheless lived a most public and, at times, storybook
    existence.
4.  [Napoleon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q517)
    ([1998/01/05/0985423](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E5DC1430F936A35752C0A96E958260))
    Sherlock Holmes turns 144 tomorrow, but he and **the Napoleon of**
    *crime* are still at it.
5.  [Ruth Messinger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4291304)
    ([1998/01/06/0985708](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504E4DB1230F935A35752C0A96E958260))
    She\'s **the Ruth Messinger of** *1998*,\'\' Mr. Mahoney said,
    referring to the Democrat who lost to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani this
    year.
6.  [Madonna](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1744)
    ([1998/01/07/0985825](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E1DF1330F934A35752C0A96E958260))
    Alejandro Armengol, a critic for El Nuevo Herald, a Miami newspaper,
    dismissed Ms. Valdes last year as \'\'**the Madonna of** *Cuban
    literature*, with an equal capacity to transform self-assurance and
    the grotesque into spectacle, to show vulgarity and eroticism
    stripped of any mystery.\'\'
7.  [Samuel French](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7411423)
    ([1998/01/11/0987037](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE0DA1E30F932A25752C0A96E958260))
    Referring to the New York rights and royalties agency, he added,
    \'\'I\'m **the Samuel French of** *interactive theater*.\'\'
8.  [Felix Unger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1889422)
    ([1998/01/12/0987178](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807EFDD1539F931A25752C0A96E958260))
    I must have appeared shocked by his fastidiousness because he looked
    at me and said, \'\'I know, I\'m **the Felix Unger of** *the
    Sanitation Department*.\'\'
9.  [Ronald Reagan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9960)
    ([1998/01/20/0989011](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E5DF1038F933A15752C0A96E958260))
    Mr. Falwell referred to Mr. Netanyahu as \'\'**the Ronald Reagan
    of** *Israel*.\'\'
10. [Curt Flood](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5195372)
    ([1998/01/22/0989491](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E6D81F38F931A15752C0A96E958260))
    But Jack Newfield, who has written several New York Post columns
    lamenting the industry\'s neglect of Mr. Price, called him **the
    Curt Flood of** *rock-and-roll*, the rebel who showed a generation
    of musicians how to stand up for themselves.
11. [Mike Tyson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q79031)
    ([1998/01/24/0989937](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03EFD6153BF937A15752C0A96E958260))
    The faults of Mr. Nixon were far more serious, nor does Mr. Clinton
    deserve to be judged as **a Mike Tyson of** *politics and sex*.\'\'
12. [Lance Ito](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6483431)
    ([1998/01/24/0989958](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DEFDF123BF937A15752C0A96E958260))
    Given Kenneth Starr\'s record as **the Lance Ito of** *prosecutors*
    -- he\'s already spent three years-plus on Whitewater -- our new
    national soap opera could easily supply us with entertainment for as
    long as O. J. did.
13. [Cinderella](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q13685096)
    ([1998/01/25/0990204](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E0DF1F38F936A15752C0A96E958260))
    And the Bronx, no longer even entitled to a capital T in The Bronx,
    with its salutary high coastal elevation, is still regarded as a
    borough of cinders except when the Yankees triumph and it becomes
    for the moment **the Cinderella of** *boroughs*.
14. [Magic Johnson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q134183)
    ([1998/01/28/0991077](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01EEDF1F3BF93BA15752C0A96E958260))
    Lopez came to St. John\'s as the great Dominican hope from Rice
    High, maybe **the Magic Johnson of** *Manhattan*, and Hamilton came
    from Sewanhaka High in Nassau County, the 6-foot-11-inch sidekick
    for a potential romp to the Final Four.
15. [Garth Brooks](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q216288)
    ([1998/01/29/0991260](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E0DA163AF93AA15752C0A96E958260))
    But Grisham is **the Garth Brooks of** *popular literature*.
16. [Napoleon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q517)
    ([1998/02/01/0991925](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E6D9103BF932A35751C0A96E958260))
    But skip the small, nothing-special oysters in Creole butter and
    **the Napoleon of** *portobello mushrooms*, grilled vegetables and
    goat cheese made too sour by an overdose of balsamic vinegar.
17. [Wally Pipp](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7963465)
    ([1998/02/02/0992419](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7DF113AF931A35751C0A96E958260))
    But then, by some reckonings, Mr. Russell was **the Wally Pipp of**
    *show business*.
18. [George Orwell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3335)
    ([1998/02/04/0992795](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904E3D81F3AF937A35751C0A96E958260))
    She has been called **the Orwell of** *copy editors*, the Kasparov
    of syntax.
19. [Garry Kasparov](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q28614)
    ([1998/02/04/0992795](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904E3D81F3AF937A35751C0A96E958260))

    In many repertories they are no longer remarkable, but the
    fortepiano (**the Cinderella of** *period instruments*) inflames
    debates reminiscent of the early-music wars of 10 years ago.

    But the Chancellor has shown little inclination to bargain,
    prompting the union to dash off a news release the other day urging

    of** *municipal unions*.

    And that, Ms. Dolensek said with a slight roll of the eyes, would
    mean more irritation for City Island\'s 4,500 residents, who in a

    At a time when the young American writers were self-consciously

    Lilly, the Exes\' front woman, is all pouty smiles and sharp edges;
    Hank, their musical anchor, is a blend of unintended arrogance and

    Sam Schwartz, who writes the Gridlock Sam column for The Daily News,

    The question scientists are asking,\'\' says Lori Andrews, a
    professor of law at the Chicago-Kent College of Law, \'\'is does he
    want to be **the Bill Gates of** *the human genome*?\'\'

    So there was a certain logic in ending the series, and this concert,
    with John Zorn\'s \'\'Cat O\'Nine Tails\'\' (1988), because Mr. Zorn
    presents himself as **an Ives for** *the 90\'s*.
122. [Giotto di Bondone](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7814)

    I couldn\'t always tell the difference between the works of R.
    Madison Mitchell, a local funeral director, who was, I gather, **the

    Fortunately, being **the Buster Keaton of** *martial arts*, he makes

    ([1998/09/18/1047304](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E0DB1630F93BA2575AC0A96E958260))

    Mr. Stern, a traditionalist, has himself had a lifelong love affair

    Rocky as he was at first, Gehrig, whose fielding skills were still
    notoriously deficient when he joined the Yankees organization in

    While he\'s not exactly **the Mr. Chips of** *communications*, his

    ([1998/10/02/1050921](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E3DF1238F931A35753C1A96E958260))

    And that was fine with the Met\'s trustees, who looked upon
    photography, more or less, as **the Elvis of** *the visual arts*:
    fast, slick and indecently young, with a history going back only as
    far as 1839.
138. [Nelson Bunker Hunt](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q711333)

    This frees up Jonathan to sprinkle his acidic wit on art experts and
    thieves like Dan Menzies (\'\'**the Al Capone of**

    His advisers hope he could be a Vice-Presidential candidate or a
    Cabinet secretary in a Republican administration, and Mr. Rowland
    was tickled to see himself referred to as \'\'**the George W. Bush
    of** *the North*\'\' in a recent article in U.S. News & World
    Report.

    For starters, The Body\'s bad-guy persona, which included wearing

    By contrast, Mr. Clinton \'\'came in here and he trashed the

    Meanwhile, his wife, Sumitra, **the Pamela Harriman of**
    *post-independence New Delhi*, is out every night ministering to the

    Batali\'s shows on the Food Network, \'\'Molto Mario\'\' and

    The traditional pub decor of Tir Na Nog, where every furnishing,
    down to the last brick (straight from Belfast) has been imported

    Critics and contemporaries have called Mr. Curran **the Buster
    Keaton of** *dance*, because his style suggests a sad comedic
    reverie.
2.  [Mike Tyson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q79031)
    ([1999/01/03/1074221](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEEDE133FF930A35752C0A96F958260))

    He was **the James Herriot of** *New York City*,\'\' said a client,
    Michele Gover, referring to the British country veterinarian who

    ([1999/01/04/1074577](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E6D9163EF937A35752C0A96F958260))
    May there be **a Kevin Ward for** at least three of the dance
    luminaries who died last year: the incandescent Svetlana Beriosova,
    a star of Britain\'s Royal Ballet; Protima Bedi, the vibrant dance
    activist who founded the young Nrityagram Dance Ensemble of India,
    and Viola Farber, an early Merce Cunningham dancer who endowed
    eccentricity with rare grace. //

    HE was **the Fred Astaire of** *repartee*, a man whose tailoring
    seemed to precede his birth.
8.  [Neil Armstrong](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1615)
    ([1999/01/10/1075868](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E6DC153EF933A25752C0A96F958260))
    I think of him as **the Neil Armstrong of** *comedy*.
9.  [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([1999/01/10/1075993](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07EED6113EF933A25752C0A96F958260))
    If it works it will go down as **the Johnny Appleseed of**
    *radio*.\'\'
10. [Robert Moses](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1111386)
    ([1999/01/10/1076147](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E1DA1631F933A25752C0A96F958260))
    He was **the Robert Moses of** *CUNY*,\'\' said Jay Hershenson,
    CUNY\'s vice chancellor for university relations.
11. [Katharine Graham](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q435203)
    ([1999/01/11/1076310](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E2D61631F932A25752C0A96F958260))

    industry*.
12. [Mark Spitz](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q180748)
    ([1999/01/12/1076537](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E0D91431F931A25752C0A96F958260))
    Bibi is **the Mark Spitz of** *Israeli politics* -- no Israeli
    leader has ever crisscrossed the Rubicon faster or more often.
13. [Édith Piaf](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1631)
    ([1999/01/14/1077023](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E6DE1331F937A25752C0A96F958260))
    Call her **the Edith Piaf of** *Nafta*, this American-born,
    Spanish-speaking resident of Montreal is thoroughly modern in her
    syncretic approach to pop, and classic in her florid, imperious
    singing.
14. [Nebuchadnezzar II](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12591)
    ([1999/01/17/1077677](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00E5D81731F934A25752C0A96F958260))
    Although just six square miles, it is grand and bold, **a
    Nebuchadnezzar of** *Champagne* as opposed to the split that is
    Laguna Beach.
15. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1999/01/17/1077956](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE5D91F31F934A25752C0A96F958260))

16. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1999/01/17/1077956](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE5D91F31F934A25752C0A96F958260))
    But although Jordan retired from the Chicago Bulls and the game of
    basketball last week, there\'s still **a Michael Jordan of**
    *snowboarding*.
17. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1999/01/17/1077956](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE5D91F31F934A25752C0A96F958260))

    Terje Haakenson, a Norwegian, executes moves on a snowboard that
    nobody had ever seen before, so he\'s dubbed **the Michael Jordan
    of** *snowboarding* -- in every interview and article on him.
19. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1999/01/17/1077956](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE5D91F31F934A25752C0A96F958260))
    That makes him **the Michael Jordan of** *cricket*.
20. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1999/01/17/1077956](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE5D91F31F934A25752C0A96F958260))

21. [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([1999/01/17/1077956](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE5D91F31F934A25752C0A96F958260))
    The last time he retired, to play baseball, the Chicago Bulls\'
    owner, Jerry Reinsdorf, called him **the Babe Ruth of**
    *basketball*.

    ([1999/01/21/1078893](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E2DE1030F932A15752C0A96F958260))
    But it is Ms. Vega, 43, who has become **the Vanna White of** *the
    lottery drawings*, invited to more charity events and panel
    discussions and onto the Oprah Winfrey show for a makeover.
25. [Buster Keaton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103949)
    ([1999/01/22/1079076](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E2DE1130F931A15752C0A96F958260))
    It\'s fortunate that Jackie Chan is **the Buster Keaton of**
    *martial arts films* because Chris Tucker, his partner in Brett
    Ratner\'s comedic action film, talks many times too much for both of
    them.
26. [Robert Ryman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q640936)
    ([1999/01/22/1079251](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E0D81E30F931A15752C0A96F958260))
    Susanna Coffey could be called **the Robert Ryman of**
    *self-portraiture*.
27. [Wyatt Earp](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q44616)
    ([1999/01/23/1079361](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E0DA1639F930A15752C0A96F958260))
    That\'s why they call me **the Wyatt Earp of** *whales*, because
    I\'m just saying, \'Let\'s obey the law.\'
28. [Bob Costas](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2458861)
    ([1999/01/24/1079816](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E0DE1530F937A15752C0A96F958260))
    A prominent journalist is \'\'**the Bob Costas of** *literary
    criticism*, a fan.\'\'
29. [Larry Flynt](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223839)
    ([1999/01/24/1079942](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E5DB1130F937A15752C0A96F958260))
    In 1896 he began to illustrate literary classics for the publisher
    Leonard Smithers, whom Mr. Skemer describes as \'\'**the Larry Flynt
    of** *his day*,\'\' meaning his intentions were wider than merely
    purveying pornography; he wanted to challenge Victorian social
    standards.
30. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1999/01/24/1080017](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E2DB1F30F937A15752C0A96F958260))
    If you think that Mike will live forever, remember the role Johnny
    Carson played in the national culture (he was **the Michael Jordan
    of** *late-night TV*) and the enormous coverage of his retirement
    and his replacements.
31. [Joseph Cornell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q694774)
    ([1999/02/01/1081906](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E5DD1538F932A35751C0A96F958260))
    Variously described as a gadfly, an eccentric, a photographer\'s
    photographer and **the Joseph Cornell of** *photography*, Mr. Sommer
    worked in relative isolation in Arizona for more than a half-century
    and until the last several years was the medium\'s best-kept secret.
32. [Cinderella](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q13685096)
    ([1999/02/02/1082040](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02EFDF1238F931A35751C0A96F958260))
    Understandably, it began to seem like **the Cinderella of** *South
    Kensington*.
33. [Meryl Streep](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q873)
    ([1999/02/07/1083167](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E6D71338F934A35751C0A96F958260))
    For a quintessential supporting player like Joan Allen, who has
    become **the Meryl Streep of** *that category*, she seems primed for
    her third supporting nomination as the 50\'s sitcom wife in
    \'\'Pleasantville.
34. [Betsy Ross](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234952)
    ([1999/02/07/1083390](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E7D7173BF934A35751C0A96F958260))
    But he is not remembered as **the Betsy Ross of** *Arabia*.
35. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([1999/02/14/1084883](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E4DB123BF937A25751C0A96F958260))
    His practice boarded up, the 51-year-old Rosemond wanders the
    country eight months of the year, **the Johnny Appleseed of**
    *discipline*, putting on nearly 250 shows annually.
36. [Cinderella](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q13685096)
    ([1999/02/14/1085295](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E5DC123AF937A25751C0A96F958260))
    Savennieres, **the Cinderella of** *French whites*, rarely is
    invited to the ball.

    ([1999/02/18/1086058](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6DA1F3AF93BA25751C0A96F958260))
    And the strong sense of history prompts obvious parallels: Karen
    Cord Taylor, editor and publisher of The Beacon Hill Times, pointed
    out that Charles Bulfinch, the famed architect and developer whose
    gems, like the State House, crown Beacon Hill, was something like
    **the Donald J. Trump of** *his day*.
38. [Dan Biederman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5213152)
    ([1999/02/20/1086460](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805E1D7143DF933A15751C0A96F958260))
    It is this kind of grandiose talk that makes some people kid Mr.
    Russo about trying to be **the Dan Biederman of** *Brooklyn* -- a
    tongue-in-cheek comparison to the Manhattan BID president who got on
    the wrong side of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for wielding too much
    power.
39. [P. T. Barnum](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766)
    ([1999/02/23/1087326](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E2DC103DF930A15751C0A96F958260))
    He called the highly praised head of the city school system, Paul
    Vallas, a \'\'**the P. T. Barnum of** *education*\'\' and vowed to
    dismiss him if elected.
40. [Imelda Marcos](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q285536)
    ([1999/03/12/1091677](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E0D91F3FF931A25750C0A96F958260))

    Alfons Mucha was **the Andy Warhol of** *his era*, a decorative
    artist who defined a style -- Art Nouveau -- and became a media
    star.
42. [Frédéric Chopin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1268)
    ([1999/03/14/1092125](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E1DD103FF937A25750C0A96F958260))
    Nevertheless, the Concerto for Piano and Orchestra by Grieg, who was
    once called **the Chopin of** *the North*, opens the festival with
    Francois-Rene Duchable as soloist and Michael Schondwandt conducting
    the Collegium Musicum.
43. [Gertrude Stein](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q188385)
    ([1999/03/14/1092170](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E3DF1E3FF937A25750C0A96F958260))

    He is still booed in Fenway Park for the outcome of that season,
    many Red Sox faithful forever maintaining that Zimmer should\'ve
    rested his regulars more, should\'ve trusted the maverick
    left-hander Bill Lee -- **the David Wells of** *his time* -- in a
    crucial game against the Yankees.
45. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([1999/03/18/1093288](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9501E5D81631F93BA25750C0A96F958260))
    The condition has been called **the Rodney Dangerfield of** *modern
    ailments* because most patients never take it seriously enough to
    take it to their doctors\' attention and treat themselves with
    over-the-counter antacids, which may not be enough to prevent
    dangerous changes in the cells that line the esophagus.
46. [Dennis Rodman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q201608)
    ([1999/03/21/1094215](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E2DB1331F932A15750C0A96F958260))
    Still, he seemed extremely pleased by the welcome he received in New
    Hampshire, where he was front-page news in the local papers, one of
    which referred to him as \'\'**the Dennis Rodman of** *potential
    Republican candidates*.\'\'
47. [John Wooden](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q551032)
    ([1999/03/23/1094568](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901EFDC1131F930A15750C0A96F958260))
    Pushing hard is the ethic of Alamosa, a remote mountain city of
    12,000 with a thriving runners colony built around the success of
    Vigil, considered **the John Wooden of** *cross-country running*.
48. [Susan Lucci](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q242936)
    ([1999/03/24/1094796](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E5DF1F31F937A15750C0A96F958260))
    TOM WOLFE can no longer claim to be **the Susan Lucci of** *the
    American Academy of Arts and Letters*.
49. [Christian Lacroix](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q350844)
    ([1999/03/28/1095605](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DEEDF1E31F93BA15750C0A96F958260))

    ([1999/03/28/1095607](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E7DE1E31F93BA15750C0A96F958260))
    America today is **the Michael Jordan of** *geopolitics* -- the
    overwhelmingly dominant system.
51. [Warren Buffett](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q47213)
    ([1999/04/02/1097007](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6DB1539F931A35757C0A96F958260))
    One longtime media expert quipped that Mr. Malone saw himself as
    **the Warren Buffett of** *the media industry*, alluding to Mr.
    Buffett\'s strategy of taking large passive positions in other
    companies.
52. [Madonna](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1744)
    ([1999/04/04/1097313](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504EEDC1739F937A35757C0A96F958260))
    It is **the Madonna of** *Italian-American literature* in that it
    shows the transition from the Italian immigrant to American citizen
    like no other book of its genre.\'\'
53. [Dorothy Parker](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q270707)
    ([1999/04/11/1099068](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E7DD1539F932A25757C0A96F958260))
    Cuetara is a talented artist who clearly qualifies as **the Dorothy
    Parker of** *picture book repartee*.
54. [Leonardo da Vinci](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q762)
    ([1999/04/11/1099329](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06EED81238F932A25757C0A96F958260))
    Dr. Reddy\'s designs for condoms with built-in bulges are an attempt
    to rethink the way condoms work, prompting Adam Glickman, the
    founder of Condomania, a specialty retailer and Internet-based
    mail-order company, to call the taciturn Indian designer \'\'**the
    Leonardo da Vinci of** *the condom*.\'\'
55. [Mike Tyson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q79031)
    ([1999/04/18/1101096](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E1D6123BF93BA25757C0A96F958260))

    Zina is, of course, a fictionalized portrait of Nabokov\'s own wife,
    Vera, the woman he would call his \'\'first and best reader,\'\' the
    woman whom friends would hail as \'\'**the St. Sebastian of**
    *wives*,\'\' the \'\'international champion in the Wife-of-Writer
    Competition.\'\'
58. [Paul](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9200)

    Stashower reports the reactions of crowd and reporters -- the
    mixture of reverence, incredulity and ridicule that had become
    associated in his final years with the writer whom many saw as
    \'\'**the St. Paul of** *spiritualism*\'\' and many more as \'\'a
    sad and deluded old man who had squandered his greatness.\'\'

    If Wynton Marsalis is **the Steven Spielberg of** *the jazz scene*,
    the alto saxophonist Steve Coleman has a strong claim to being its
    Stanley Kubrick.
60. [Patrick Henry](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q311885)
    ([1999/05/03/1104902](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E0DA173CF930A35756C0A96F958260))
    The Massachusetts House Speaker, Thomas (\'\'No tribute or
    ransom\'\') Finneran, who took the heat for driving the Patriots
    away, now looks like **the Patrick Henry of** *football*, if only
    because he had the temerity to call Mr. Kraft \'\'a whiny
    millionaire looking for a bribe.\'\'
61. [Willie Mays](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q561852)
    ([1999/05/09/1106292](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E4D91E3CF93AA35756C0A96F958260))

    *boroughs*, preservationally speaking.
63. [Napoleon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q517)
    ([1999/05/16/1107816](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04EFD9133FF935A25756C0A96F958260))
    In the book \'\'Great Merchants of Early New York\'\' (The Society
    for the Architecture of the City, 1987) Joseph Devorkin calls him
    \'\'**the Napoleon of** *the Department Store industry*.\'\'
64. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1999/05/19/1108691](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE6D9133EF93AA25756C0A96F958260))
    Tropicana is **the Michael Jordan of** *orange juice*,\'\' said

    ([1999/05/22/1109265](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE7D91631F931A15756C0A96F958260))
    With eye-opening revisionist takes on \'\'Uncle Tom\'s Cabin\'\' and
    Tennessee Williams\'s \'\'Kingdom of Earth\'\' and such
    comparatively commercial fare as \'\'As Bees in Honey Drown,\'\'
    this young troupe has already established itself as **the Mark
    McGwire of** *new theater groups*.
66. [Rembrandt](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5598)
    ([1999/05/23/1109543](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEED9103EF930A15756C0A96F958260))

    ([1999/06/04/1112428](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E5DE1639F937A35755C0A96F958260))
    If Nelson Mandela is **the George Washington of** *this new
    democracy*, the kind of giant among men who turns down offers to be
    king, then Mr. Mbeki is its John Adams.
68. [Paul McCartney](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2599)
    ([1999/06/11/1114314](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CEFDC1638F932A25755C0A96F958260))
    Always **the McCartney of** *the group*, Mr. McLennan gracefully
    avoids that more famous tunesmith\'s weakness for banality by
    turning his sugar sharp without warning, as when a darkening chord
    progression turned the phrase \'\'I\'m gonna make you happy\'\' into
    a threat.
69. [Ricky Martin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q128799)
    ([1999/06/13/1114740](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E3D71039F930A25755C0A96F958260))
    Clancy is **the Ricky Martin of** *the United States military*, and

    ([1999/06/20/1116779](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE1DD1138F933A15755C0A96F958260))
    The ubiquitous hedge-fund manager Jim Cramer, **the Timothy Leary
    of** *the hour*, would later draw a line that transcended
    generation: \'\'In my business, there are two kinds of people, those
    who make money and those who critique those who make money.\'\'
73. [Burt Bacharach](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q212762)

    The lineup is intended to draw crowds from inside and outside Latin
    New York, with crossover bands like Inti Illimani of Chile and Noche
    Flamenco of Spain, as well as Armando Manzanero, the crooning
    balladeer regarded as **the Burt Bacharach of** *Mexico*.
74. [Mother Teresa](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30547)
    ([1999/06/27/1118924](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E2DA143AF934A15755C0A96F958260))
    Another, Diana Lemieux, described her as \'\'**the Mother Teresa

75. [Randy Moss](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q462925)
    ([1999/06/27/1119027](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905E2DD123AF934A15755C0A96F958260))
    If not, Odom will become **the Randy Moss of** *the N.B.A.*, a guy
    with a lot of question marks who may pay huge dividends.
76. [Vincent van Gogh](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5582)
    ([1999/07/04/1120682](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E3D71E3AF937A35754C0A96F958260))
    But I guarantee you, he will become **the Van Gogh of** *the 60\'s*.
77. [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254)
    ([1999/07/04/1120695](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E5DC1F3AF937A35754C0A96F958260))
    A model for this blending of formalism and freedom is the work of
    George Balanchine, whom Mr. Wilson calls \'\'**the Mozart of** *the
    20th century*.\'\'
78. [Rose Kennedy](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q236540)
    ([1999/07/04/1120723](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02EFDB163DF937A35754C0A96F958260))
    But in Glen Cove, a city where the name Suozzi has a Kennedyesque
    aura, Mrs. Suozzi is the quiet matriarch, **the Rose Kennedy of** *a
    political dynasty with a small-town cachet*.
79. [Forbes Burnham](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q718256)
    ([1999/07/11/1122398](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE7DD143DF932A25754C0A96F958260))
    The headmaster is described as **the Forbes Burnham of** \'\'*our
    schoolworld*,\'\' where the Government ordered children to learn
    agricultural skills and work in the fields.
80. [Mark McGwire](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q462481)
    ([1999/07/12/1122958](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E1D8103CF931A25754C0A96F958260))
    But even though Pedro Martinez is slight enough to be a tattoo on
    the biceps of Mark McGwire, he is **the Mark McGwire of** *pitchers
    in 1999*.
81. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([1999/07/15/1123603](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E2DA173FF936A25754C0A96F958260))

    As for Jem, he jumps ship early to enter the service of the war hero
    Gen. George Monk, **the Colin Powell of** *his day* in that he might
    have assumed power but didn\'t.
83. [Horatio Alger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q453251)
    ([1999/07/20/1124759](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E6DC1E3FF933A15754C0A96F958260))

    We might claim for Rand a minor place in art history: an interesting
    American modulation of European modernist sobriety into bouncy
    Brooklyn cheerfulness, **a Richard Feynman among** *the Einsteins of
    design*, taking a Klee doodle for a walk on a Mondrian Manhattan
    grid.
85. [Liz Smith](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6660303)
    ([1999/07/25/1125783](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805E2DF173EF936A15754C0A96F958260))
    Mr. Gaines, the best-selling author of \'\'Philistines at the
    Hedgerow: Passion and Property in the Hamptons,\'\' is the Hamptons
    insider of the moment, and although the comparison makes him cringe,
    **the Liz Smith of** *the rolling dunes*.
86. [Édith Piaf](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1631)
    ([1999/07/25/1125801](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E5DC173EF936A15754C0A96F958260))
    The pitch of the party suddenly went up: Diane Dufresne (\'\'**the
    Edith Piaf of** *all the French community*,\'\' Mr. Pelletier said)
    had arrived.

    People began referring to him as **the Wagner of** *contemporary
    art* because, like Wagner, Barney operated in a mythological

    Though his latest film explores one more urban inferno and
    colorfully reaffirms Mr. Scorsese\'s role as **the Dante of** *the
    Cinema*, creating its air of nocturnal torment took some doing.
123. [Brian Wilson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q313013)

    ([1999/12/05/1158279](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E4DE143FF936A35751C1A96F958260))

    Or when, during a heated practice, she\'s trying to outfox
    youngsters like Chamique Holdsclaw, the player she\'s pegged as the
    star for the new millennium and to whom she\'s prepared to bequeath
    her moniker as **the Michael Jordan of** *women\'s ball*.
142. [Jim Morrison](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q44301)
    ([1999/12/09/1159451](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804EEDC1F3EF93AA35751C1A96F958260))
    Here in his homeland Mr. Coelho first came to attention in the early
    1970\'s not as a novelist but as a pop music lyricist, writing more
    than 70 songs with the rock star Raul Seixas, described by Mr.
    Coelho as \'\'**the Jim Morrison of** *Brazil*.\'\'
143. [Bruce Springsteen](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1225)
    ([1999/12/11/1159942](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805E1D61531F932A25751C1A96F958260))

    One of the Island\'s more iconoclastic performers, James Yarsky
    performs emotionally charged, raging songs in highly theatrical
    stage performances that led one writer too call him **the David
    Lynch of** *folk music*.
145. [Martin Luther King, Jr.](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8027)
    ([1999/12/14/1160910](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE1D71131F937A25751C1A96F958260))
    Ms. Boone is so ambitious that she graduated from Michigan State
    University at 16, opened her gallery at 25 and was arrested on
    art\'s behalf at 47, a brouhaha that prompted a compliment from her
    son -- \'\'He said I was **the Martin Luther King for**
    *artists*\'\' -- and resolved itself last week when the district
    attorney asked that the charge against her be dropped.
146. [Jack Kerouac](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q160534)
    ([1999/12/17/1161636](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E0D81530F934A25751C1A96F958260)) W.
    Axl Rose is **the Jack Kerouac of** *hard rock*, embodying the myth
    of masculinity in all its beauty and horror.
147. [Britney Spears](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11975)
    ([1999/12/19/1161983](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E3D71E31F93AA25751C1A96F958260))
    From the cavalcade of come hither, \'\'Teen Beats\'\' photos to the
    completely predictable array of blockbuster classics like
    \'\'Crazy,\'\' \'Your Cheatin\' Heart\'\' and \'\'Lovesick
    Blues,\'\' this album feels like an attempt to become **the Britney
    Spears of** *country*.
148. [Florence Nightingale](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37103)
    ([1999/12/26/1163753](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E3D91639F935A15751C1A96F958260))

    ([1999/12/26/1163871](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07E6DF1239F935A15751C1A96F958260))
    It was given by her husband of the time, Michael Todd, **the P. T.
    Barnum of** *Hollywood*, and the event arguably ushered in the
    modern Hollywood era.
150. [Donald Trump](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686)
    ([1999/12/27/1164179](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E0D61139F934A15751C1A96F958260))
    They are people of such retiring natures that when one admits to
    being \'\'quietly confident\'\' about the competition, he comes
    across as **the Donald Trump of** *the sheep-dog world*.

2000 {#section-14}

1.  [Tiger Woods](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q10993)
    ([2000/01/02/1165313](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E0D91F39F931A35752C0A9669C8B63))
    He was **the Tiger Woods of** *his time* -- which is to say, Tiger
    Woods without all the handlers.
2.  [Quentin Tarantino](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3772)
    ([2000/01/02/1165360](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E7D91638F931A35752C0A9669C8B63))
    Webster was **the Quentin Tarantino of** *his age*, but he didn\'t
    invent this mixed style of drama.
3.  [Kennedy](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6389584)
    ([2000/01/02/1165503](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E7DD1238F931A35752C0A9669C8B63))
    Try to imagine an Eisenhower or **a Kennedy of** *the year 2000* --
    or even a Sam Rayburn or an Everett Dirksen.
4.  [Tony Robbins](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q380429)
    ([2000/01/07/1166580](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804EFDA153BF934A35752C0A9669C8B63))
    PLUSES: Tom Cruise as **the Tony Robbins of** *misogynistic sex*, in
    another role in which his phony, too-bright smiles match his
    character.
5.  [Calvin Klein](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q214800)
    ([2000/01/08/1166834](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E1D8133BF93BA35752C0A9669C8B63))
    Among them were Howard C. Fox, \'\'the Chicago clothier and sometime
    big-band trumpeter who claimed credit for creating and naming the
    zoot suit with the reet pleat, the reave sleeve, the ripe stripe,
    the stuff cuff and the drape shape that was the stage rage during
    the boogie-woogie rhyme time of the early 1940\'s,\'\' and Russell
    Colley, a mechanical engineer who became \'\'**the Calvin Klein of**
    *space*\'\' and was known to a generation of astronauts as the
    \'\'father of the space suit.\'\'
6.  [Henry Ford](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8768)
    ([2000/01/09/1166971](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E6DC1538F93AA35752C0A9669C8B63))
    He can be viewed as **the Henry Ford of** *religion*, with a
    uniquely American knack for enterprise and innovation, or a Jim
    Jones figure from the dark edge of the frontier, ready to take his
    followers off a cliff with him.
7.  [Norman Rockwell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q271884)
    ([2000/01/09/1167075](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E6D9173BF93AA35752C0A9669C8B63))
    Since his first coffee-table book about the state almost 20 years
    ago, he has become something of an unofficial state chamber of
    commerce, **a Norman Rockwell of** *a changing Jerseyana*.
8.  [Dave Douglas](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1173180)
    ([2000/01/13/1168186](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6DF143AF930A25752C0A9669C8B63))
    But there\'s a resourcefulness here: they use cheap electronics
    well, they mine a lot of feeling from single vamps, and the
    disciplined, versatile cornetist Rob Mazurek may yet become **the
    Dave Douglas of** *the Midwest*.
9.  [Cal Ripken](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q731168)
    ([2000/01/15/1168688](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E1DB103AF936A25752C0A9669C8B63))
    He\'s **the Cal Ripken of** *TV*,\'\' said Mr. Rubenstein, referring
    to the Baltimore Orioles shortstop with the stellar attendance
    record.
10. [Dorothea Dix](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q452469)
    ([2000/01/16/1168831](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E2D71F3BF935A25752C0A9669C8B63))
    Guiding the international entourage that chilly fall morning was
    Virginia Gonzalez, **the Dorothea Dix of** *Mexico*, that nation\'s
    leading advocate for the mentally ill and the country\'s No.
11. [King Kong](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q216810)
    ([2000/01/16/1169086](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E7D7133AF935A25752C0A9669C8B63))
    WHEN the Godzilla of the Internet decides to wed **the King Kong
    of** *content*, it is a natural time for the other denizens of the
    jungle to wonder what the future will hold for the colossal couple
    and the world they inhabit.
12. [Napoleon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q517)
    ([2000/01/19/1169686](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE6D9163DF93AA25752C0A9669C8B63))
    Conan Doyle persevered in his homicide, inventing **the Napoleon
    of** *crime*, Moriarity, who in \'\'The Final Problem\'\' plunges
    with Holmes into the seething waters of Reichenbach Falls in
    Switzerland.
13. [Liv Tyler](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q168763)
    ([2000/01/21/1170158](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E6DD123DF932A15752C0A9669C8B63))
    Meanwhile, almost every other man in town wants to marry young Anne
    Page, who is apparently **the Liv Tyler of** *14th-century Windsor*.
14. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([2000/01/23/1170707](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E4D6153DF930A15752C0A9669C8B63))
    Velvet paintings may be **the Rodney Dangerfield of** *the art
    world*, but Leeteg, who died in 1953, was known as the American
    Gauguin.
15. [John Madden](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q51516)
    ([2000/01/23/1170962](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DEFDB1E3DF930A15752C0A9669C8B63))
    He has the je ne sais quoi that will make him **the John Madden of**
    *racing*, said David Hill, chairman of the Fox Sports Television
    Group.
16. [Tom Hanks](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2263)
    ([2000/01/24/1171146](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE4DC1F3DF937A15752C0A9669C8B63))

    He has since established himself as **the Tim McCarver of**
    *tennis*, the undisputed master of his craft.
18. [Dan Marino](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q195367)
    ([2000/01/31/1172834](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE7D91F3CF932A05752C0A9669C8B63))
    Otherwise he runs the risk of being remembered as **the Dan Marino
    of** *the media business*, a great player who was unable to win the
    biggest prize in his chosen game.
19. [Gary Cooper](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q93957)
    ([2000/02/06/1174173](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E4DD143FF935A35751C0A9669C8B63))
    Ms. Bonnaire\'s greatest physical attribute is her walk, which is
    brisk and androgynously sexy -- she\'s **the Gary Cooper of**
    *French actresses* -- but what gives her a star\'s allure is her
    ability to hold her emotions suggestively in reserve.
20. [Stanley Kubrick](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2001)
    ([2000/02/09/1175017](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E1DA143EF93AA35751C0A9669C8B63))
    He is **the Stanley Kubrick of** *New York chefs* -- difficult to
    get a read on, by most accounts difficult to deal with, but always
    pointed in a direction that feels as though it will lead straight to
    the next big thing.
21. [Ricky Martin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q128799)
    ([2000/02/13/1176237](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E3DA1F3EF930A25751C0A9669C8B63))
    I used to wonder if the cocky strategist, **the Ricky Martin of**
    *dirty campaigning*, could have pulled President Bush through in
    \'92, as he did in \'88, when he zestfully turned Willie Horton into
    the bogyman.
22. [Tina Turner](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131814)
    ([2000/02/14/1176472](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06EFDB1731F937A25751C0A9669C8B63))

    Nobody wants to come off as **the John Rocker of** *hockey* and say
    no.
24. [Walter Lippmann](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q316568)
    ([2000/02/16/1176873](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1231F935A25751C0A9669C8B63))
    I once called him **the Walter Lippmann of** *the hydrant set*, and
    he loved it.\'\'
25. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([2000/02/18/1177372](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E3DF1E31F93BA25751C0A9669C8B63))
    Despite their deepest wishes, Gordy Sheer and Chris Thorpe know that
    the two-man luge is **the Rodney Dangerfield of** *winter Olympic
    sports*.
26. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([2000/02/22/1178469](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE7DB1530F931A15751C0A9669C8B63))
    It\'s very unique, though, to be able to bring **the Michael Jordan
    of** *baseball* home where he was raised in Cincinnati,\'\' said Jim
    Bowden, the Reds\' general manager, who tried to minimize how the
    contract favors the Reds.
27. [Moses](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9077)
    ([2000/02/24/1178852](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E4DD1030F937A15751C0A9669C8B63))
    Another Web site, www.nyhistory.com /harriettubman/life.htm, has a
    biography and links to other sites on Harriet Tubman, **the Moses
    of** *the railroad*, an escaped slave who is credited with making 19
    return trips to save more than 300 others.
28. [Alanis Morissette](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q130742)
    ([2000/02/27/1179735](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4D61530F934A15751C0A9669C8B63))
    Conservative Christianity has its own chaste heartthrobs, like
    Joshua Harris, the raffishly cute author of \'\'I Kissed Dating
    Good-Bye,\'\' and the singer Rebecca St. James, **the Alanis
    Morissette of** *the W.W.J.D.*
29. [Clark Kent](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q79015)
    ([2000/03/02/1180625](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E1D81039F931A35750C0A9669C8B63))
    The Tre-Piu Pavilion was designed by Antonio Citterio, **the Clark
    Kent of** *Italian design*, whose subtle way of making modern
    furniture a tad more sensual has been a huge success in attracting
    Americans to Italian high design.
30. [Tony Gwynn](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1145222)
    ([2000/03/08/1182251](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E1DA1038F93BA35750C0A9669C8B63))
    Junior had no desire to be **the Tony Gwynn of** *Seattle*: a
    lovable ancient staying put so he would not have to go through the
    trouble of redecorating another house in another baseball town.
31. [Martha Stewart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234606)
    ([2000/03/12/1183090](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05EFDB1238F931A25750C0A9669C8B63))
    I\'ll be **the Martha Stewart of** *travelers*, carrying a colorful
    supply of grosgrain ribbons to use as bookmarks: yellow for hotels,
    red for restaurants, green for the historical-cultural section, blue
    and purple for places of interest.
32. [Stevie Nicks](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234691)
    ([2000/03/12/1183115](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01EFD61338F931A25750C0A9669C8B63))
    At 46, Ms. Gillis is a bit like **the Stevie Nicks of** *the dance
    world* -- her name evokes cultlike enthusiasm or groans, but not
    much in between.
33. [Tiger Woods](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q10993)
    ([2000/03/12/1183194](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E1DC1E38F931A25750C0A9669C8B63))

    He is **the Mother Teresa of** *the wild bird world*,\'\' said Ward
    Stone, the wildlife pathologist for the State Department of
    Environmental Conservation, who has sent injured Canada geese and
    ducks to the sanctuary.
35. [Joseph Cornell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q694774)
    ([2000/03/13/1183591](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE4DA123BF930A25750C0A9669C8B63))
    Between the adored exotic birds, the boxlike space and the
    prevailing aura of innocence and obsession, you may leave this show
    feeling that you have met **the Joseph Cornell of** *the 19th
    century*.
36. [Paul](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9200)
    ([2000/03/14/1183782](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03E2D7133BF937A25750C0A9669C8B63))
    He understands how much trouble he\'s in -- witness his sudden
    re-emergence as a born-again reformer, **the Saul of Tarsus for**
    *campaign finance*.
37. [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([2000/03/14/1183800](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02E6DF103BF937A25750C0A9669C8B63))
    He is **the Babe Ruth of** *football*,\'\' Mr. Molinary said,

    Fortune magazine called Mr. Joy \'\'**the Edison of** *the
    Internet*\'\': he designed crucial system software and three of
    Sun\'s microprocessors as well as developing the Java programming

    So pity the poor 70\'s, **the Dangerfield of** *decades*, whose

    1970\'s Shere Hite, **the Cassandra of** *women\'s sex*, was
    criticized for choosing a sample that included too many women who

    Right now this presence hovers like a beautiful mist over \'\'The

    If it were possible to have met any one of them, it would probably
    be Goncharova, **the Damien Hirst of** *prerevolutionary Moscow*,

    One hopes this beautifully annotated five-CD set will lead to a
    resurgence of interest in Malvina Reynolds, **the Cole Porter of**

    fellow organist and admirer Carlo Curley, whose 1998 memoir, \'\'In
    the Pipeline,\'\' describes Fox and the scene: \'\'He looked like
    **the Elton John of** *the organ* with an outlandish bow tie,

    A quiet 43-year-old computer consultant who has been called

    But whereas Disney was primarily an impresario and an empire
    builder, **the Henry Ford of** *fantasy*, Dr. Seuss, who died in

    By the end of his 13-year tenure at Barney\'s, Mr. Chazen said, he

    IF you were **the Rodney Dangerfield of** *your profession*,
    fighting every day for respect and all too often falling short,
    would you go out of your way to do something that you know will make
    people think even less of you?
10. [P. T. Barnum](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766)
    ([2001/01/25/1265566](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E7D61F3CF936A15752C0A9679C8B63))

    developer, Dan Rosenfeld, affectionately.

    McAlister\'s teammate, defensive back Robert Bailey, calls him **the
    Mike Tyson of** *cornerbacks*, a physical, smothering cornerback who
    can frustrate and dominate.
12. [Greta Garbo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5443)
    ([2001/01/31/1267102](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE3D81E3FF932A05752C0A9679C8B63))
    To me the Menil is **the Garbo of** *museums* in its elegance and
    allure, and its seeming desire to be left alone,\'\' said Vance
    Muse, the collection\'s spokesman.
13. [Jack Paar](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1587581)
    ([2001/01/31/1267248](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01EED61F3FF932A05752C0A9679C8B63))
    Lured by the WFUV antenna (\'\'I thought magic was made there\'\'),
    Mr. Fornatale, whose father and grandfather delivered ice until
    refrigeration rendered the job obsolete, decided by the time he was
    6 or 7 to be a radio broadcaster, **a Jack Paar for** *the Buddy
    Holly generation*.
14. [Walter Cronkite](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q31073)

    Between phone calls to Warren Buffett and Michael Eisner, Mr.
    MacAdams said, Mr. Wenner had agreed with an epithet fit for a
    magazine editor, pronouncing Mr. Loder \'\'**the Walter Cronkite
    of** *MTV*.\'\'
15. [Fred Astaire](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q100937)

    At 7:30, Diane Sawyer did a teaser for the segment, using a handle
    made up by one of my editors: \'\'We are going to meet a woman who
    has been called **the Martha Stewart of** *Money*, and she\'s going
    to tell us secrets about your bank.\'\'

    A nasty drug habit pulled him from view, though, and he became **the
    Robert Downey Jr. of** *rock*.
18. [Ross Perot](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q313697)
    ([2001/02/14/1270741](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06E5DB1630F937A25751C0A9679C8B63))
    Bent will turn out to be the next Republican up-and-comer or **the
    Ross Perot of** *local politics*.

    ([2001/02/18/1271516](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E0D81131F93BA25751C0A9679C8B63))

    ([2001/02/25/1273726](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02EFDF1530F936A15751C0A9679C8B63))

    But Claesen was definitely **a Horatio Alger of** *the Colonial
    era*, having made it from indentured servant to wealthy town
    magistrate.
23. [Johann Sebastian Bach](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1339)
    ([2001/03/04/1275151](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E1DC1738F937A35750C0A9679C8B63))

    Less than a decade ago Gucci was an aging symbol of playboy
    plenitude and scandal, which was then entrusted to Mr. Ford, whose
    good looks and middle-of-the-road talent led people to refer to him
    as **the Kevin Costner of** *fashion*.
27. [Bob Fosse](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q313256)
    ([2001/03/07/1276052](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E3DE1E3BF934A35750C0A9679C8B63))
    And while he modestly demurs, Mr. Barker is widely regarded as **the
    Bob Fosse of** *the carefully choreographed event that consumes
    Midtown Manhattan with tin whistles, step dancers and some two
    million spectators on that invariably brisk March 17 morning*.
28. [Émile Zola](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q504)
    ([2001/03/09/1276449](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E0D6163AF93AA35750C0A9679C8B63))
    George P. Pelecanos arrives with the best possible recommendations
    from other crime writers (e.g., Elmore Leonard likes him), and with
    jacket copy praising him as \'\'**the Zola of** *Washington,
    D.C.*\'\' But what he really displays here, in great abundance and
    to entertaining effect, is a Tarantino touch.
29. [George Washington](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23)
    ([2001/03/09/1276451](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E7DF173AF93AA35750C0A9679C8B63))
    William the Silent, **the George Washington of** *the Netherlands*,
    was killed in Delft in 1584, and in the following decades his son
    and successor, Prince Maurits, moved the court to The Hague, three
    miles away.

    ([2001/03/11/1276853](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06EFD7103BF932A25750C0A9679C8B63))
    His hunger for data is so voracious that I once told him he could
    end up as **the Robert McNamara of** *the urban education war*.
31. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([2001/03/12/1277435](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E4D6133AF931A25750C0A9679C8B63))

    Mr. Weaver is **the Julia Child of** *long-lost vegetables*, a man
    who, with his passionate energy and globe-trotting discoveries, has
    transformed the field of heirloom vegetables and, along with it,
    rediscovered heirloom recipes.
34. [Lou Gehrig](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q357444)
    ([2001/03/16/1278194](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7DC173DF935A25750C0A9679C8B63))
    He\'s like **the Lou Gehrig of** *Stalingrad*: a wholesome young man
    thrust half-unwittingly into the big time.
35. [Laurie Anderson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q235066)
    ([2001/03/16/1278195](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E6DC173DF935A25750C0A9679C8B63))

    permatan and peroxide.

    ([2001/03/21/1279458](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805EFD8103DF932A15750C0A9679C8B63))

    *hoops*.
39. [Stephen King](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q39829)
    ([2001/03/30/1281715](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E6DB143FF933A05750C0A9679C8B63))
    For good measure there\'s a little of \'\'Willie Wonka and the
    Chocolate Factory\'\'; Mr. Rodriguez feels the sportive twist that
    Roald Dahl, **the Stephen King for** *kids*, drizzled over his
    bad-dreamscapes.
40. [Pablo Picasso](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5593)
    ([2001/03/30/1281740](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905E4D8143FF933A05750C0A9679C8B63))
    In Paris, where she had made her debut in 1934, this reconfiguring
    of the body reminded critics of Cubist forms, and Ms. Akesson was
    called \'\'**the Picasso of** *Dance*.\'\'
41. [Cleopatra](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q635)
    ([2001/04/01/1282085](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E5DD173CF932A35757C0A9679C8B63))
    While Diderot spends his mornings filling up notebooks with dazzling
    plans for how to improve Russia, \'\'**the Cleopatra of** *the
    age*\'\' busies herself with the nasty business of running an unruly
    country.
42. [Maria Callas](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q128297)
    ([2001/04/01/1282101](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03E2DE113CF932A35757C0A9679C8B63))
    And when the press writes \'**the Maria Callas of** *Cardiff*,\'
    I\'m like, that\'s a slightly dramatic comparison, since she was a
    great opera singer and I\'m this little girl from Wales.
43. [Clarence Thomas](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11142)
    ([2001/04/01/1282256](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E0DA143FF932A35757C0A9679C8B63))
    It\'s not as good as being attorney general, but it sounds better
    than being **the Clarence Thomas of** *the New Jersey Supreme
    Court*.
44. [Fred Astaire](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q100937)
    ([2001/04/01/1282371](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E4DC123FF932A35757C0A9679C8B63))
    The film calls Tony \'\'**the Fred Astaire of** *Brooklyn*\'\'; the
    star of the article is \'\'the very best dancer in Bay Ridge.\'\'

    ([2001/04/01/1282451](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE6DE103FF932A35757C0A9679C8B63))

    He became known internationally as **the Bob Dylan of** *Vietnam*,
    singing of the sorrow of war and the longing for peace in a divided
    country.
47. [Rothschild](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q76988)
    ([2001/04/06/1283439](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E4D8143EF935A35757C0A9679C8B63))

    He is sort of **the Jimmy Stewart of** *Vermont politics*,\'\' said
    Garrison Nelson, a political science professor at Tufts University
    and the University of Vermont.
49. [Caesar](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16202022)
    ([2001/04/08/1283883](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E6D9113FF93BA35757C0A9679C8B63))
    When Barnum died in 1891, The Times called Bailey \'\'**a Caesar
    among** *showmen*,\'\' describing him as \'\'a little man, slender
    and wiry, a perfect bundle of nerves.\'\'
50. [Rothschild](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q76988)

    One of the few professionally successful Jewish artists in early
    19th-century Europe, Oppenheim (1800-82) was known as \'\'the
    painter of Rothschilds and **the Rothschild of** *painters*.\'\'
51. [Art Tatum](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q109053)
    ([2001/04/14/1285385](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E1DE1331F937A25757C0A9679C8B63))
    Now and then he seems like **the Art Tatum of** *our own time*: once
    during Tuesday night\'s performance he played a single-note
    improvisation so fast and so long that you wondered if he\'d be able
    to wrap it up without exploding.
52. [Erin Brockovich](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q232019)
    ([2001/04/15/1285551](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03E1D6143EF936A25757C0A9679C8B63))
    Nicholson Baker never set out to become **the Erin Brockovich of**
    *the library world*, a crusader in the stacks.
53. [Marilyn Manson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q186327)
    ([2001/04/15/1285680](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E3DF1531F936A25757C0A9679C8B63))
    I\'m sorry, Mr. Rockwell, but von Trier is just **the Marilyn Manson
    of** *the art-film circuit*.
54. [Josef Mengele](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q57109)
    ([2001/04/22/1287579](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E3D71330F931A15757C0A9679C8B63))
    During a series of trials of coaches, doctors and sports officials
    that concluded last year, a lawyer shouted at Dr. Lothar Kipke, a
    senior doctor who helped administer drugs to numerous East German
    swimmers, \'\'You are **the Josef Mengele of** *the G.D.R.*

    They also feared that the reputation of Clara Hale, whom many
    thought of as **the Mother Teresa of** *Harlem*, would be forever
    tarnished.
57. [Brad Pitt](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q35332)

    He is also sort of like\'\' -- she paused, searching for the proper
    analogy -- \'\'**the Brad Pitt of** *Japan*.\'\'
58. [Clark Kent](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q79015)
    ([2001/04/29/1289018](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3D61439F93AA15757C0A9679C8B63))
    IT\'S easy to understand why Chuck Loeb is called \'\'**the Clark
    Kent of** *jazz guitar*.\'\'
59. [Maria Callas](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q128297)
    ([2001/04/29/1289186](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904E2D61039F93AA15757C0A9679C8B63))
    Though the protagonist, Thea, was modeled on Fremstad, **the Maria
    Callas of** *her day*, the book, said Mr. Maurer, is really a thinly
    disguised childhood biography of Cather.
60. [Typhoid Mary](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q238948)
    ([2001/04/29/1289366](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E7DE1F30F93AA15757C0A9679C8B63))
    Byrne was once called \'\'**the Typhoid Mary of** *the irony
    epidemic*,\'\' but that\'s a fundamental misreading of him.
61. [Martha Stewart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234606)
    ([2001/04/29/1289401](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E3DB1F30F93AA15757C0A9679C8B63))

    That the stupidity and cartoonlike performances of \'\'Inbred
    Rednecks\'\' are deliberate and consistent attests to the creative
    control of Joshua P. Warren, who wrote, directed, produced and
    scored the film besides playing the role of Clovis, one of the good

    virtue of their age and their commitment to the economic reforms
    begun by Deng Xiaoping in 1978.

    Charlie Bundrum was a hammer-swinging roofer, **a John Henry of**

    It is also the consuming passion of Ms. Ventre (pronounced
    VEN-tree), 58, a cheerful, raspy-voiced Brooklynite whose day job is
    in advertising and public relations but whose heart lies in being
    **the Abner Doubleday of** *dog dancing*.

    One intrepid traveler, Robert Sullivan, wrote a wonderful book,
    \'\'The Meadowlands\'\' (Scribner, 1998), in which he played **the

120. [Ronald Reagan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9960)
    ([2001/09/14/1324812](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506EFD91038F937A2575AC0A9679C8B63))

    I was kind of **the David Duchovny of** *the show*, a shadowy

    said.
123. [Bill Gates](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5284)
    ([2001/09/23/1327184](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E7D71738F930A1575AC0A9679C8B63))
    One of the weirder analogies that journalists have drawn to place
    Babyface in the culture is to call him **the Bill Gates of** *the

124. [Sally Field](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q187033)
    ([2001/10/03/1330428](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E5DD113DF930A35753C1A9679C8B63))

    In many ways he could be considered **the Stanford White of**
    *Beverly Hills*, catering to deep-pocketed film stars and executives
    who could well afford and appreciate his romantic architectural
    stage sets, in which their well-dressed and well-heeled lives are
    played out,\'\' Dunning says of Neff.
126. [Elvis Presley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q303)
    ([2001/10/14/1333507](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E0D81F3DF937A25753C1A9679C8B63))
    Posthumous albums coming from Tupac\'s estate continue to top the

    The parody lingers on: YUE-SAI KAN, whom People magazine once called
    **the Barbara Walters of** *China* because she was a mainstay of
    Chinese television for years, began by introducing herself.
130. [Ted Kaczynski](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q222134)
    ([2001/10/18/1334884](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E5DB153EF93BA25753C1A9679C8B63))

    It\'s Jack who becomes the poet-in-residence here, **the Stanley
    Kunitz of** *the playground*, and his evolution from resistance to
    grudging pride in his own abilities is thrilling to witness.
132. [Yogi Berra](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q367566)
    ([2001/10/21/1335824](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804E3DE113EF932A15753C1A9679C8B63))
    But because we cannot merely appreciate his supernatural skill,
    there has been a movement to make Ichiro **the Yogi Berra of**
    *these times*.
133. [Andy Warhol](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5603)
    ([2001/10/26/1337039](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE0DE1331F935A15753C1A9679C8B63))
    William Beckford (1760-1844) was **the Andy Warhol of** *his day*, a
    self-conscious aesthete, compulsive collector of art and furniture,
    an author, designer and famous style maven.
134. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([2001/10/28/1337997](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07EFDF1630F93BA15753C1A9679C8B63))

    A decade ago, Ms. Trevi, nicknamed **the Madonna of** *Mexico*, was
    one of Latin America\'s biggest pop stars, selling millions of
    records and racy posters and calendars, and talking of running for
    president.
136. [Curt Schilling](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q954975)
    ([2001/10/30/1338371](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05EFDE1430F933A05753C1A9679C8B63))
    Drysdale, **the Curt Schilling of** *his day*, shut out the Yankees,
    1-0, in Game 3 on three hits, which happened to have been the last
    time before Sunday evening that the Yankees had had as few as three
    hits in a World Series game.
137. [Rembrandt](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5598)
    ([2001/11/02/1339141](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E5DC1130F931A35752C1A9679C8B63))
    IN an uncanny boon for the Guggenheim, if you\'re cynically minded,
    the fortuitous arrival of the two-year-old Norman Rockwell traveling
    exhibition in New York after Sept. 11 gives everybody in town a
    chance to contemplate through altered eyes **the Rembrandt of**
    *Punkin Crick*, as a critic acidly dubbed him years ago.
138. [John Singer Sargent](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q155626)
    ([2001/11/02/1339281](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E7D91E30F931A35752C1A9679C8B63))
    Armstrong, for example, is featuring pictures of fashionable,
    late-19th-century beauties by Albert Belleroche, a virtuoso
    technician who was known as **the John Singer Sargent of**
    *lithography*.
139. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([2001/11/04/1339731](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E0DB1739F937A35752C1A9679C8B63))
    In their case, it\'s from wearing pin-striped shirts bearing the
    numbers of the most storied players in baseball history -- the Babe
    (now known as **the Michael Jordan of** *his time*), Lou Gehrig (if
    he hadn\'t died under contract, he would still be playing and nobody
    would know Cal Ripken), Joe DiMaggio (less mysteriously dignified
    but more interesting since the recent publication of a sour bio),
    Yogi Berra (in a deserved comeback as the role model for Yoda) and
    Mickey Mantle (redeemed by a gutsy death and Billy Crystal\'s movie,
    \'\'61\*\'\').
140. [Sylvia Plath](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q133054)
    ([2001/11/04/1339880](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03E2DB1731F937A35752C1A9679C8B63))
    But to devotees of Kahlo -- whom the writer Christopher Goodwin
    describes as \'\'feminism\'s premier art icon, **the Sylvia Plath
    of** *the canvas*\'\' -- the marriage to Rivera has all the
    ingredients of a heroic love story.
141. [Jerry Bruckheimer](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q217037)
    ([2001/11/04/1339882](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E1DB1731F937A35752C1A9679C8B63))
    When Robert accuses her of being **the Jerry Bruckheimer of**
    *cakes*, she responds that he\'s the Paul Thomas Anderson of cakes.
142. [Paul Thomas Anderson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q25132)
    ([2001/11/04/1339882](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E1DB1731F937A35752C1A9679C8B63))
    When Robert accuses her of being the Jerry Bruckheimer of cakes, she

    ([2001/11/05/1340214](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E1DC1439F936A35752C1A9679C8B63))
    Some at NBC see Mr. Brokaw\'s ratings edge on the evening news, and
    the fact that more Americans turned to him in that moment of
    national crisis, as evidence that he has become the leading network
    wise man, **the Walter Cronkite of** *his generation*.
144. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([2001/11/08/1340953](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E7DC1139F93BA35752C1A9679C8B63))
    The solo sensitively celebrates the gifts of Steve Humphrey, a
    longtime standout in the fine company and who, in a world that
    valued art more, would probably be **the Michael Jordan of**
    *dance*.
145. [Rembrandt](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5598)
    ([2001/11/09/1341232](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E2DA1139F93AA35752C1A9679C8B63))
    Coming after Sept. 11, the show gives everybody in town a chance to
    contemplate **the Rembrandt of** *Punkin Crick*, as a critic acidly
    dubbed him years ago, through altered eyes.
146. [Joseph Cornell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q694774)
    ([2001/11/11/1341765](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E6DC1339F932A25752C1A9679C8B63))
    (The critic Gary Carey once described him, perceptively, as
    \'\'**the Joseph Cornell of** *French cinema*.\'\')
147. [Phil Spector](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213793)
    ([2001/11/11/1341767](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE4DC1339F932A25752C1A9679C8B63))
    The songs by Max Martin, **the Phil Spector of** *current
    teeny-pop*, sound tougher than before, even if he does keep
    rewriting previous Spears songs: \'\'Bombastic Love\'\' transfers
    \'\'Oops!
148. [Bobby Orr](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q348017)
    ([2001/11/13/1342543](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E7DC1038F930A25752C1A9679C8B63))
    Fetisov, who has often been called **the Bobby Orr of** *European
    hockey*, was past his prime years as a player when he joined the
    N.H.L.
149. [Martha Stewart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234606)
    ([2001/11/18/1343937](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806EFD61F38F93BA25752C1A9679C8B63))
    She\'s **the Martha Stewart of** *the North Fork*,\'\' Mr. Combs
    said proudly, showing off the raspberry and green shaded dining room
    that was originally the parlor in Home Port, the oldest operating
    bed-and-breakfast in the town of Southold.
150. [Rudy Giuliani](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q212648)
    ([2001/11/18/1343943](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E0DE173BF93BA25752C1A9679C8B63))
    He was like **the Rudy Giuliani of** *his time*: he wanted tramps
    and convicted criminals put to work.
151. [Jack Welch](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q355314)
    ([2001/11/25/1345897](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E6DB123AF936A15752C1A9679C8B63))
    Wall Street and the news media had tagged Jacques A. Nasser of Ford
    Motor, an abrasive man who billed himself as **a Jack Welch for**
    *Detroit*, as the revolutionary chief executive who would shake up
    and reinvent the culture of that company; he was forced to resign in
    October.
152. [Aretha Franklin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q125121)
    ([2001/11/29/1346851](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E4D9173DF93AA15752C1A9679C8B63))
    Even as she produced hits that turned her into a soul matriarch, she
    wore her troubles on her sleeve, like **an Aretha Franklin for**
    *the hip-hop generation*.
153. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([2001/12/02/1347549](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E4D7153AF931A35751C1A9679C8B63))
    The Andrea Doria seems destined to go down in the annals of maritime
    history as **the Rodney Dangerfield of** *sunken ships*.
154. [Joe Torre](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q707804)
    ([2001/12/04/1348229](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E7D8173BF937A35751C1A9679C8B63))

    ([2001/12/04/1348238](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E7D61E3DF937A35751C1A9679C8B63))
    He is **the Pelé of** *Brazilian literature*, and he would do all of
    us a great service by publicizing Brazil abroad, so we have to have
    a space for him.\'\'
156. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)

    s 1998 entry draft, he was touted by the Tampa Bay Lightning as
    \'\'**the Michael Jordan of** *hockey*\'\' -- the ultimate sports
    mixed metaphor.
157. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([2001/12/05/1348659](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E2D7173CF936A35751C1A9679C8B63))
    But it\'s doubtful that the Lightning could justify trading
    \'\'**the Michael Jordan of** *hockey*\'\' for Gomez and White.
158. [Ingrid Bergman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q43247)
    ([2001/12/14/1351150](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E3DA133FF937A25751C1A9679C8B63))
    Molly Ringwald, **the Ingrid Bergman of** *Reagan-era American
    adolescence*, appears in a late cameo as a cynical, foul-mouthed
    flight attendant.
159. [Tab Hunter](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q725395)
    ([2001/12/14/1351150](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E3DA133FF937A25751C1A9679C8B63))
    Mr. Hughes\'s movies are scrambled with their more recent
    derivations, especially the towering oeuvre of Freddie Prinze Jr.,
    **the Tab Hunter of** *Clinton-era adolescence*, here impersonated
    by Chris Evans.

    Fitzhugh, though, writes like a man born to the genre -- he\'s a
    honky-tonk O. Henry, or **a Damon Runyon of** *the sour-beer
    circuit*.
162. [George Washington](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23)

    In the world of wealthy businessmen who have taken to running big

    A few weeks after Sept. 11, this column remarked that New York was

    Blair Sabol, from Villanova, Pa., future fashion guerrilla; a girl

    I drove out to a spot on the north side of the pier and stopped to

    Re \'\'Defector Indignant at President of Harvard\'\' (news article,
    April 16): Prof. Cornel West\'s description of Lawrence H. Summers,
    the president of Harvard, as \'\'**the Ariel Sharon of** *American
    higher education*\'\' reflects his lack of sensitivity toward the
    daily tragedy unfolding in the Middle East.

    Tony Monteiro, a councilman from Elizabeth, said he remembered that
    Mr. Free, the vice president of United Gunite, a sewer-repair and
    road-paving company, swaggered like he was \'\'**the Bill Gates of**

    It is important for our new faculty colleague Cornel West to know
    that even as we welcome him back in our midst, we look with strong
    disfavor upon his characterization of Lawrence H. Summers, the
    president of Harvard, as, in his words, \'\'**the Ariel Sharon of**

    Though Lawrence\'s memoir veers off in unexpected directions -- her
    discussions of spirituality and visions make her seem like **the
    Shirley MacLaine of** *Madison Avenue* -- she is generally frank and
    forthright about what made her and her peers tick and why it helped
    to have, as she did, training as an actress with Sanford Meisner

    In the depths, a young woman, Maria (Brigitte Helm, **the Kirsten
    Dunst of** *the Weimar Republic*), prophesies the coming of a
    messianic figure called the Mediator, whose name sums up the
    temperate, reformist message buried in the movie\'s sweep and
    bombast.
106. [Tiger Woods](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q10993)
    ([2002/07/16/1408731](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E0DE1130F935A25754C0A9649C8B63))

    They don\'t want to see a glossy, sympathetic \'\'Lifestyles of the
    Reich and Fascist\'\': a cute, brooding teenage Hitler painting away
    in a garret, listening to Wagner (**the Eminem of** *his age*),
    hanging at the cafes in Vienna with Wittgenstein and Freud,
    accumulating disappointments and rejections as raw material for
    \'\'Mein Kampf,\'\' roiled by sexual confusion, frightened by the
    advances of an amorous milkmaid, and like everyone else then and
    now, steamed at the French.
108. [John Grisham](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q106465)
    ([2002/07/18/1409060](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE2D71239F93BA25754C0A9649C8B63))
    In downtown Manhattan, for instance, it\'s the Beat poets and
    writers: Kerouac (**the John Grisham of** *the Beats*, when it comes
    to theft popularity), Bukowski, Burroughs, Ginsberg, Hunke.
109. [Julia Roberts](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40523)

    Protracted farewells are traditionally the province of opera
    singers, but as he has geared up to leave the directorship of the
    New York Philharmonic, Kurt Masur has become **the Barry Bonds of**
    *goodbyes*.
111. [Margaret Mead](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q180099)
    ([2002/07/21/1409735](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E3D61639F932A15754C0A9649C8B63))

    He segues from his comic impersonations (\'\'I\'m **the Robin
    Williams of** *child abuse*,\'\' Pelzer says) into stories of his
    own abuse and ends with the platitude, \'\'Everyone has issues.
115. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([2002/07/28/1411495](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E1DD1538F93BA15754C0A9649C8B63))
    The tens of thousands of songs Lomax recorded himself -- across the
    United States and in rural Italy, the Caribbean, Great Britain and
    Spain -- and the many others he worked to analyze and disseminate
    made him **the Johnny Appleseed of** *folk revivalists*.
116. [John Ashcroft](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q311141)
    ([2002/07/28/1411659](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E3D61E38F93BA15754C0A9649C8B63))

    With fortunes made and lost in recent years as capitalism has gone
    global, there has been no shortage of writers aspiring to be **the
    John Grisham of** *Wall Street*, everyone from old-timers like
    Michael Thomas to newcomers like Scott Lasser.
119. [Tito Puente](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q317122)

    ([2002/08/18/1416595](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DEFDD103AF93BA2575BC0A9649C8B63))

    The wry, sexy melancholy of his observations would be seductive
    enough in its own right -- he is **the Leonard Cohen of** *the spy
    genre* -- even without the sharp political acuity that accompanies
    it.
122. [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([2002/08/25/1418681](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01EFDF103CF936A1575BC0A9649C8B63))

123. [George Hamilton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q359416)
    ([2002/08/26/1418809](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01EEDD103CF935A1575BC0A9649C8B63))
    They can remember when **the George Hamilton of** *tennis*, the
    tanned Nick Bollettieri, could be spotted drinking in the sunshine
    as he eyed academy stars like Andre Agassi and Jim Courier during a
    golden era of paint-by-number instruction.
124. [Luther Burbank](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q333419)
    ([2002/08/29/1419367](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E2DD163FF93AA1575BC0A9649C8B63))

    Mr. Douglas, with his seething hostility, is **the Mike Tyson of**
    *actors*.

    ([2002/09/04/1420809](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E7DB1F3FF937A3575AC0A9649C8B63))
    He was the best -- **the Sugar Ray Robinson of** *comedy-drama*.

    ([2002/09/08/1421681](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00EFD7173FF93BA3575AC0A9649C8B63))
    I HAVE, you know, in my time been called -- in print -- **the
    Michelangelo of** *confectioners*,\'\' says the proprietor of a Los
    Angeles store where the movie star Kaye Wayfaring buys
    white-chocolate-dipped strawberries.
130. [George Orwell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3335)
    ([2002/09/08/1421694](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504E7D6173FF93BA3575AC0A9649C8B63))
    Hitchens was so good at this -- so forceful and ubiquitous -- that
    The New York Observer\'s Ron Rosenbaum called him **a George Orwell
    for** *our time*.
131. [Walter Chalmers Smith](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7964529)
    ([2002/09/08/1421694](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504E7D6173FF93BA3575AC0A9649C8B63))
    The second is a parlor game: identifying **an Orwell for** *our
    time*.
132. [Elvis Presley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q303)
    ([2002/09/08/1421800](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E2DB163EF93BA3575AC0A9649C8B63))
    With a mustache instead of sideburns, she has become **an Elvis of**
    *the art world*: disembodied from her real life and the most
    resonant qualities of her art, the Frida Kahlo of the early 21st
    century is now available in a handy, manageable key-chain size.
133. [Robert Moses](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1111386)
    ([2002/09/15/1423720](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805E5D61731F936A2575AC0A9649C8B63))
    The general assumption was, and remains, that Judson\'s mania for
    power -- with his empire of orchestras, soloists and conductors, he
    was **the Robert Moses of** *American classical music for half a
    century* -- predisposed him toward conductors he could mentor or
    otherwise control.
134. [Adolf Hitler](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q352)
    ([2002/09/19/1424847](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03EFDE1330F93AA2575AC0A9649C8B63))
    His semi-conservative opponent, Edmund Stoiber, tut-tuts about
    anti-Americanism but is afraid to take a stand against **the Hitler

    ([2002/09/20/1425037](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E5DD1030F933A1575AC0A9649C8B63))
    In addition to Oppenheimer, Mr. Herken has chosen to focus on two
    other prominent scientists who played crucial roles in nuclear
    research: Ernest O. Lawrence, the Nobel laureate, who invented the
    cyclotron and presided over Berkeley\'s Radiation Laboratory, which
    looked to benefit from lucrative government financing; and Edward
    Teller, the Hungarian émigré physicist, who helped invent the
    hydrogen bomb and whose dark, brooding personality caused Richard
    Rhodes to dub him \'\'**the Richard Nixon of** *American
    science*.\'\'
136. [Mick Jagger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q128121)
    ([2002/09/22/1425730](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE7DF1530F931A1575AC0A9649C8B63))
    But with his turbulent energy, penetrating gaze and wiry physique,
    Mr. Pendleton, 53, could be considered **the Mick Jagger of** *the
    dance world*.
137. [Peter Pan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q107190)
    ([2002/09/22/1425945](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03EFD81E30F931A1575AC0A9649C8B63))
    Slight of build with a preternaturally boyish face, Dr. Brandt, 53,
    is **the Peter Pan of** *cosmetic self-improvement*, a man whose
    puckish charm is rivaled only by his flair for self-promotion.
138. [Grandma Moses](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q260683)
    ([2002/09/26/1426646](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E6D91339F935A1575AC0A9649C8B63))

    Television is **the Johnny Appleseed of** *bad manners*, displaying
    assorted baiting, gesturing and mouthing off -- and that is just
    from the talk-show hosts in the studios.
140. [Percy Foreman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11212217)
    ([2002/09/28/1427197](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E6DC1638F93BA1575AC0A9649C8B63))
    He insisted that he was not **the Percy Foreman of** *Odessa*, but
    that Mr. Foreman, the famed lawyer, was the Warren Burnett of
    Houston.
141. [Bob Barker](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q381178)
    ([2002/09/29/1427456](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E1DB1039F93AA1575AC0A9649C8B63))
    Aside from his news job, Mr. Hoff is **the Bob Barker of** *a new
    reality game show*, \'\'Spend It Fast,\'\' produced by Atlas Media
    for the Jericho-based Women\'s Entertainment Network.
142. [Sylvia Plath](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q133054)

    More recently Franklin has become, as Maddox puts it, \'\'**the

    Bertarelli takes traditional Swiss discretion to new levels: as the
    only syndicate head who refuses to give interviews, he is **the J.
    D. Salinger of** *the docks*.
144. [Jane Austen](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36322)
    ([2002/10/07/1429887](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E6DC123BF934A35753C1A9649C8B63))
    Ms. Pearson does so well in capturing the funny, calculating aspects
    of her English heroine\'s life that The Guardian has called her
    \'\'**a Jane Austen among** *working mothers*.\'\'
145. [Leonardo da Vinci](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q762)
    ([2002/10/10/1430643](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E4DF163AF933A25753C1A9649C8B63))
    There is also a series of print ads, including a six-page magazine
    insert that thumbnails Mr. Earl\'s history and labels him \'\'**the
    da Vinci of** *Detroit*.\'\'
146. [Helen Keller](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q38203)
    ([2002/10/13/1431340](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E1D6103BF930A25753C1A9649C8B63))

    We know that Virginia\'s governor, Mark Warner, is bucking to be
    **the Rudy Giuliani of** *the crisis*; Kathleen Kennedy Townsend is
    trying to capitalize on her personal history with tragic gun
    killings to save her limp gubernatorial bid; Democrats in Congress
    tried to capitalize by rushing to pass a small-bore gun control
    measure that was going to pass anyway; President Bush and the G.O.P.
149. [Marco Polo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6101)
    ([2002/10/18/1432877](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E2DE133DF93BA25753C1A9649C8B63))
    Mr. Zurita, a professional chef who has clearly earned the title of
    **the Marco Polo of** *the mess hall*, gave it a moment\'s thought,
    then added Ethiopian, Greek, Israeli, Kenyan, Mexican, Portuguese,
    Dominican and Thai.
150. [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254)
    ([2002/10/20/1433170](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E4D6163AF933A15753C1A9649C8B63))
    If his autobiography, \'\'Memoirs,\'\' is to be believed, David
    Rockefeller is one such person, **a Mozart of** *modulated tones*.
151. [Bill Clinton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1124)
    ([2002/10/20/1433181](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E2D6163AF933A15753C1A9649C8B63))

    Robbins himself was a master of baggy-pants comedy in his Broadway
    days, and had it suited him, he probably could have become **the
    Buster Keaton of** *ballet* as well.
153. [Jane Goodall](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q184746)
    ([2002/10/20/1433275](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E5D71F3AF933A15753C1A9649C8B63))

    Only three years ago, he was derided as \'\'**the Elvis of**
    *hip-hop*,\'\' or a raw version of the 1980\'s flattopped performer
    Vanilla Ice (no comparison could be worse on these streets).
156. [Lech Wałęsa](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q444)

    group of intellectuals, labor leaders, Liberation Theology advocates
    and environmentalists soon thereafter founded the Workers\' Party.

    But there was no flag on the play, one of many that have fueled the
    belief in the Giants\' organization that in the first season after
    Strahan broke the record for sacks, rules do not seem to apply when
    it comes to stopping him -- as if Strahan has become **the Shaquille
    O\'Neal of** *the N.F.L.*
159. [Cassandra](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170779)
    ([2002/11/03/1437108](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E6DF133CF930A35752C1A9649C8B63))
    Is he **the Cassandra of** *our age*, prophesying disasters to which
    we, like the citizens of doomed Troy, willfully stop our ears?
160. [David Spade](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q298658)
    ([2002/11/03/1437138](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE6DF143FF930A35752C1A9649C8B63))

    Amitabh Bachchan, **the Paul Newman of** *Bollywood*, stars as one
    of six complete strangers who team up to commit the perfect crime.

    ([2002/11/04/1437699](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E0D8143EF937A35752C1A9649C8B63))
    I\'m not saying we\'ll be **the J. D. Power of** *corporate
    governance*,\'\' said Jack Kemp, the former Cabinet secretary and
    chairman of the new venture, referring to the reviewer of
    automobiles.
163. [Bill Buckner](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2903144)
    ([2002/11/07/1438644](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406EEDE1F3EF934A35752C1A9649C8B63))

    ([2002/11/08/1438902](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E6DC1731F93BA35752C1A9649C8B63))
    He\'s **the Cal Ripken of** *Japan*, but with more punch,\'\' said
    Marty Kuehnert, a sports broadcaster and longtime resident in Japan.

    Mr. Stephens is quick to say that he is **the Jackie Robinson of**
    *stickball*, having been the first white man to play on an otherwise
    all-black team.
166. [Martha Stewart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234606)
    ([2002/11/17/1441244](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07EFDA1F31F934A25752C1A9649C8B63))
    Over the roar of laughter and loud party prattle, Ms. Haan, whom

    ([2002/11/24/1443301](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04EFDE1039F937A15752C1A9649C8B63))
    They rhapsodize that his amazing vignettes of dysfunctional families
    make him **the Raymond Carver of** *hip-hop*.
170. [Donald Trump](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686)
    ([2002/11/24/1443485](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE6DB1130F937A15752C1A9649C8B63))
    (Already one player has become **the Donald Trump of** *the online

    ([2002/11/27/1444011](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E1DC1638F934A15752C1A9649C8B63))
    In the Hollywood pantheon of recycled heroes, he suggests **a Clark
    Gable for** *the new millennium*, without the raised eyebrow and
    rakish leer.
172. [César Tovar](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5202642)
    ([2002/11/27/1444117](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE4D71738F934A15752C1A9649C8B63))
    But there are nuances: a great team like the Atlanta Braves will
    cost more to watch on weekends than on weeknights, and a middling
    team like the Philadelphia Phillies has become a utilityman of
    sorts, **the César Tovar of** *the schedule*, moving through three
    ticket tiers depending on the date.
173. [Dick Clark](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q366563)
    ([2002/11/29/1444510](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DEEDE1238F93AA15752C1A9649C8B63))

    One might think of him as **the Barry Diller of** *Jackson Hole,
    Wyo.*, where Mr. Blum recently moved with his wife, Audrey, a former
    model, and their twins.
175. [Yves Saint Laurent](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q171556)
    ([2002/12/01/1444800](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2D81639F932A35751C1A9649C8B63))

    *American fashion*.
176. [J. D. Salinger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q79904)
    ([2002/12/03/1445460](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE4DD1F38F930A35751C1A9649C8B63))
    But Mr. Trudeau, who has not given a sit-down television interview
    in 31 years, is **the J. D. Salinger of** *comic strip artists*.
177. [Madonna](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1744)
    ([2002/12/07/1446605](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E4D9113BF934A35751C1A9649C8B63))
    The singer, known as **the Madonna of** *Mexico*, was an icon of
    rebellion among young girls until she was accused of luring girls
    into sexual relationships with her manager.
178. [Adlai Stevenson II](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q311719)
    ([2002/12/09/1447293](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E4D71F3BF93AA35751C1A9649C8B63))
    The administration is betting that Mr. Saadi and his colleagues
    together will ultimately prove to be **the Adlai Stevenson of**
    *this drama*, that they will unintentionally provide the road map to
    continuing weapons projects, or false claims that those projects
    have been dismantled.
179. [Igor Stravinsky](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7314)
    ([2002/12/15/1448831](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E0DC133AF936A25751C1A9649C8B63))
    Al, who is 42 and has two children and can often be found listening
    to sports radio as his car idles in a parking lot, fancies himself
    **the Stravinsky of** *excuses*.
180. [Wernher von Braun](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q57384)
    ([2002/12/19/1449879](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E1DD133DF93AA25751C1A9649C8B63))
    Approached by the Whirlpool Corporation two years ago to be a
    consumer \'\'pilot\'\' for a next generation of fabric-care
    appliances, Mrs. Bova quickly proved to be **the Wernher von Braun
    of** *duds-in-suds*, pushing the \$10 billion company toward
    imagining a braver future -- brighter, cleaner, fresher!
181. [Adolf Hitler](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q352)
    ([2002/12/20/1450289](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E3DD1E3DF933A15751C1A9649C8B63))
    The traditional idea is to stamp the feet to drown out any mention
    of Haman, **the Hitler of** *his Biblical day*; Mr. Borocz has
    worked up elaborate wooden toys in which shoes are activated by
    cranks to produce that result.
182. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([2002/12/21/1450439](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DEED81F3DF932A15751C1A9649C8B63))
    That is helping Gerald R. Ford, once parodied as **the Rodney
    Dangerfield of** *presidents*, to enjoy a rehabilitation of sorts,
    bringing new respect for his leadership skills.
183. [Ralph Fiennes](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q28493)
    ([2002/12/22/1450621](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E4DA153DF931A15751C1A9649C8B63))
    The elegant British baritone Simon Keenlyside is **the Ralph Fiennes
    of** *opera*, not just an affectingly restrained actor, but, as his
    recent Lincoln Center performances in the choreographer Trisha
    Brown\'s staging of Schubert\'s song cycle \'\'Winterreise\'\' made
    clear, an agile dancer.
184. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([2002/12/22/1450658](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E2DB133DF931A15751C1A9649C8B63))

    Take: Rushing to release this less than a year after his last album,
    Mr. Keith sings of vengeance, vacation and the rodeo, becoming **the
    Hank Williams Jr. of** *the moment*.

    Lee\'s vixeny style made her something like **the Madonna of** *her
    time* (an idea verified for me by, of all people, my neighborhood
    butcher, a New Deal baby who said of Lee, \'\'Oh, she was the bad
    girl\'\').
189. [Harry Cohn](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1586470)
    ([2002/12/29/1452280](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE2D71E3CF93AA15751C1A9649C8B63))

    Mr. Byrd has occupied an extraordinarily beautiful suite,
    resplendent with frescoes by Constantino Brumidi, the Italian artist
    often called **the Michelangelo of** *the Capitol*.

    ([2002/12/30/1452742](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02EFDA173FF933A05751C1A9649C8B63))
    Lord Byron was **the Mick Jagger of** *his time*, \'\'mad, bad, and

    The 19th-century explorer Richard Burton, **the Ernest Shackleton
    of** *sex*, wrote that if a woman can perform this technique,
    \'\'her husband will then value her above all women, nor would he
    exchange her for the most beautiful queen in the Three Worlds.\'\'

    Strolling into the main room, designed to resemble a Renaissance
    Spanish courtyard, you come face to face with \'\'The Duchess of
    Alba,\'\' Goya\'s memorable portrait of **the Ava Gardner of**
    *Spanish nobility*.
3.  [King Kong](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q216810)

5.  [Alex Rodriguez](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q558664)
    ([2003/01/12/1456006](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE2D71731F931A25752C0A9659C8B63))
    Last year, the Rangers acted as if they were signing **the Alex
    Rodriguez of** *relievers*, giving Jay Powell a three-year, \$9
    million contract and Todd Van Poppel a three-year, \$7.5 million
    deal.
6.  [John F. Kennedy](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9696)

    But how to reconcile those rumors with others that have him down as
    a world-class womanizer, **the Jack Kennedy of** *the Sahara*, or
    with the official line that lists him as a doting husband and father
    to his seven children?
7.  [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([2003/01/19/1457551](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504E5DD1531F93AA25752C0A9659C8B63))
    If Wilt Chamberlain was **the Babe Ruth of** *basketball*, the
    outsize figure who forever changed his game\'s frame of reference,
    then West was the sport\'s DiMaggio, its understated classicist.
8.  [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([2003/01/23/1458686](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E1D81130F930A15752C0A9659C8B63))
    It was Feb. 19, 2002 and Eric Bergoust, **the Babe Ruth of**
    *freestyle aerials*, stood at the crest of a snowy hill making the
    last preparations for his final jump at the Salt Lake City Olympic
    Games.
9.  [Evelyn Waugh](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q107002)
    ([2003/01/26/1459685](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E2DE1630F935A15752C0A9659C8B63))
    The result is a \'\'richly constructed and brilliantly
    ornamented\'\' roman-fleuve whose \'\'tinder-dry combustion of
    comic, indignant and elegiac suggests **an Evelyn Waugh of** *the
    left*,\'\' Richard Eder said in the Book Review last year.
10. [Nell Gwyn](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234163)
    ([2003/02/02/1461536](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E6D71438F931A35751C0A9659C8B63))
    One can almost imagine Mrs. Simpson in the court of Charles II, the
    Lady Castlemaine, if not **the Nell Gwyn of** *her day*.
11. [Julius Caesar](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1048)
    ([2003/02/06/1462734](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E6DD173BF935A35751C0A9659C8B63))
    Jim Irsay, the eccentric son of the erratic Bob Irsay, **the Caesar
    of** *sports carpetbaggers*, is now running the show for the Colts.
12. [Adolf Hitler](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q352)
    ([2003/02/07/1462973](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E5D6143BF934A35751C0A9659C8B63))
    The same was said of Egypt\'s Gamal Abdel Nasser, whom the West saw
    as **the Hitler of** *the 1950\'s and 1960\'s*.
13. [Adolf Hitler](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q352)
    ([2003/02/07/1462973](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E5D6143BF934A35751C0A9659C8B63))
    A better analogy is Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya, who used to be
    denounced as **the Hitler of** *the 1980\'s*.
14. [Martin Luther King, Jr.](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8027)
    ([2003/02/09/1463692](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E2DE103BF93AA35751C0A9659C8B63))
    He\'s like **the Martin Luther King of** *basketball*,\'\' Kevin
    Garnett of the Minnesota Timberwolves said.
15. [Walt Disney](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8704)
    ([2003/02/10/1463847](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E3DB103BF933A25751C0A9659C8B63))
    Another question is, Who will be **the Walt Disney of** *this era*?
16. [Azzedine Alaia](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2553832)
    ([2003/02/11/1464040](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07E2DF1E3BF932A25751C0A9659C8B63))
    asked the designer, who thinks of himself, broadly, as **an Azzedine
    Alaïa for** *the Almanac de Gotha set*.
17. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([2003/02/20/1466343](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E2D6143DF933A15751C0A9659C8B63))

    The virtuosic writing, grand gestures and extremes of volume, with
    antecedents in \'\'Solar Trilogy\'\' (1992-95), Mr. Ruders\'s
    sprawling symphonic drama, illustrate the British critic Stephen
    Johnson\'s often repeated description of Mr. Ruders as \'\'**the
    Richard Strauss of** *the computer-age orchestra*.\'\'
19. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([2003/02/23/1467070](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06E0DB153DF930A15751C0A9659C8B63))

    ([2003/02/23/1467291](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E6D7113DF930A15751C0A9659C8B63))
    Perhaps less flatteringly, Mr. Brewington also is sometimes called
    **the Johnnie Cochran of** *Long Island*.

    ([2003/02/25/1467644](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E6DA1F3DF936A15751C0A9659C8B63))
    One of these, Dr. Edward O. Wilson, called him in a memoir \'\'**the
    Caligula of** *biology*.\'\'
23. [Vanna White](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q442202)
    ([2003/02/26/1467976](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE4DE143CF935A15751C0A9659C8B63))
    She was **the Vanna White of** *the day* -- the person who spelled
    \'\'Herbert H. Lehman,\'\' letter by letter, on a sign announcing a
    symposium that looked at his place in history and his place in the
    participants\' memories.
24. [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254)
    ([2003/03/02/1468803](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E7DA143AF931A35750C0A9659C8B63))
    In 1964, the United States Congress authorized that land all along
    the Jacks Fork River (once described by a boater as **the Mozart
    of** *rivers*) would be part of the 80,000-acre park, the first of
    the national riverways.

    The Shanghai Cosmo at 66, which was created in character with the
    restaurant\'s Chinese theme, is **a Lucy Liu of** *a drink* -- it
    lowers its eyes and kicks, the Asian Charlie\'s Angel.

    ([2003/03/02/1468986](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E3DF103CF931A35750C0A9659C8B63))
    The cosmopolitan was a kind of fast debutante that showed up in the
    1980\'s and 90\'s -- **the Cornelia Guest of** *cocktails*.
27. [Matthew McConaughey](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q188955)
    ([2003/03/07/1470289](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E0DC133FF934A35750C0A9659C8B63))
    Rodney Gilfry, the strapping, blond baritone who has been called
    \'\'**the Matthew McConaughey of** *opera*\'\' (for good or bad),
    will star in this spring\'s Encores!
28. [Martha Stewart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234606)

    ([2003/03/09/1471019](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E2DC1F3FF93AA35750C0A9659C8B63))
    He\'s **the Michael Jordan of** *the game*,\'\' Bowden said.
30. [Alexander the Great](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8409)
    ([2003/03/18/1473251](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E1D71731F93BA25750C0A9659C8B63))
    That was in the reign of Pachacuti, considered **the Alexander the
    Great of** *the Incas*.
31. [Donald Rumsfeld](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q184650)
    ([2003/03/18/1473361](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E1D71431F93BA25750C0A9659C8B63))
    Agamemnon was **the Donald Rumsfeld of** *his day*, needlessly
    angering his key allies -- and outraging Achilles by swiping his

32. [Donald Trump](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686)
    ([2003/03/20/1473894](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E3DB1031F933A15750C0A9659C8B63))
    Capitalizing on generous Medicare payments for physical
    rehabilitation, he built enough personal wealth to become known as
    **the Donald Trump of** *Birmingham*.
33. [Ed McMahon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q555370)
    ([2003/03/23/1474775](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E7DA1730F930A15750C0A9659C8B63))
    We\'re **the Ed McMahon of** *the health business*,\'\' Mr. Freeman

34. [John James Audubon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q182882)
    ([2003/03/30/1476563](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E6D81539F933A05750C0A9659C8B63))
    For this skill, he has been hailed \'\'**the Audubon of**
    *trout*.\'\'
35. [Tom Ridge](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q559822)
    ([2003/03/30/1476699](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE7D61031F933A05750C0A9659C8B63))
    Reisner is **the Tom Ridge of** *the ecology*: he\'s put us all on
    red alert, but, short of vacating the state altogether, it\'s hard
    to know what to do about it; and never addressed is the question
    that, for all we know, Reisner might have tried to answer here had
    he lived, and that\'s what it is that continues to draw people to
    the continent\'s death row.
36. [Bill Gates](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5284)
    ([2003/03/30/1476700](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7D61031F933A05750C0A9659C8B63))
    One might well object that there is nothing representative about
    them: he talks to **the Bill Gates of** *India*; he manages to find
    a non-Coptic Christian family in Egypt (who complained that the
    Americans weren\'t as tough on Muslims as the Israelis were).
37. [Leonardo da Vinci](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q762)
    ([2003/03/30/1476728](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03E7DE1530F933A05750C0A9659C8B63))
    He\'s very knowledgeable about fine art but has no idea who Krazy
    Kat is, and he\'s like **the Leonardo da Vinci of** *the cartoon
    world*.
38. [Henri Matisse](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5589)
    ([2003/04/04/1477871](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5DC1638F937A35757C0A9659C8B63))
    Nadelman, who was born in Warsaw in 1882, one year after Picasso,
    and committed suicide in the Riverdale section of the Bronx in 1946,
    was in many ways **the Matisse of** *20th-century sculpture*.
39. [Wolfgang Puck](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q78893)
    ([2003/04/06/1478378](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E6DC1E39F935A35757C0A9659C8B63))

    ([2003/04/06/1478430](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE1D91738F935A35757C0A9659C8B63))
    In the prologue, high-decibel dissonance suggests a New Age \'\'West
    Side Story,\'\' with a fiesta-like rumble, as Joseph Urla struts as
    Petruchio, **the Casanova of** *the Barrio*.
41. [Jackie Robinson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q221048)
    ([2003/04/06/1478600](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E1DC1538F935A35757C0A9659C8B63))

    And Elizabeth has apparently found a way: while visiting an obscure
    museum on her freelance job doing research for a London travel
    guide, she stumbles upon the skeleton of the notorious criminal
    Jonathan Wild -- \'\'**the Al Capone of** *the 1720\'s*\'\' -- whom
    she regards as something of a kindred spirit.
43. [Kato Kaelin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6377737)
    ([2003/04/07/1478881](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06EED81238F934A35757C0A9659C8B63))
    Then he has settled in -- as \'\'a permanent house guest, **the Kato
    Kaelin of** *the wine country*,\'\' in the case of Alan Deutschman
    -- and tried to figure out what it all means.
44. [Robert Trent Jones](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1771239)
    ([2003/04/11/1479837](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E7DE173BF932A25757C0A9659C8B63))
    I would say he is **the Robert Trent Jones of** *tracks*.\'\'
45. [Spike Lee](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q51566)
    ([2003/04/12/1480088](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905E1D7143BF931A25757C0A9659C8B63))
    Now it is also becoming known as the territory of a former graffiti
    sprayer and youth gang member, Neco Celik, whose debut movie,
    \'\'Alltag,\'\' or \'\'Every Day,\'\' is gaining him a reputation as
    **the Spike Lee of** *his time and place*.
46. [Salvador Dalí](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5577)
    ([2003/04/13/1480261](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E2D91039F930A25757C0A9659C8B63))
    Tom Wolfe called him **the Salvador Dali of** *the car circuit*.
47. [Harvey Weinstein](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q531599)
    ([2003/04/13/1480281](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E7DF1638F930A25757C0A9659C8B63))
    Like Goldwyn and Selznick before him, but smarter than either of
    them, he was a maverick, though one with establishment tastes and
    goals -- **the Harvey Weinstein of** *his day*, making the kind of
    movie that seemed custom-designed to win Academy Awards.
48. [Mick Jagger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q128121)
    ([2003/04/13/1480317](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E1DF1138F930A25757C0A9659C8B63))
    And so by the time Jeff met Mara, in 1997, he was a wizened rock
    star, **the Mick Jagger of** *digital media*.
49. [Cecil B. DeMille](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q72267)
    ([2003/04/13/1480367](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E6D91138F930A25757C0A9659C8B63))
    As a result, too many people still think of him -- if they think of
    him at all -- as a cautionary tale, an epic of career wreckage,
    **the Cecil B. DeMille of** *Hollywood zombies*, a damaged survivor
    of some terrible accident at the intersection of self-loathing and
    self-regard.
50. [Norman Rockwell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q271884)
    ([2003/04/13/1480412](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E2DB163BF930A25757C0A9659C8B63))

    Mildred herself -- Mildred Goldstein, that is, the wife of Herbert
    Goldstein, a voluble man known as **the Mad Hatter of** *Utica
    Avenue* -- died several years ago.
52. [Hulk Hogan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q44176)
    ([2003/04/14/1480850](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02EEDF133BF937A25757C0A9659C8B63))
    Meanwhile, at 5 feet 10 tall and 115 pounds, Andy is **the Hulk
    Hogan of** *this food-phobic crowd*.
53. [Nora Roberts](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q231356)
    ([2003/04/17/1481531](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E1DC1F3BF934A25757C0A9659C8B63))
    For those who write like clockwork (i.e., Stuart Woods, **the Nora
    Roberts of** *mystery best-sellerdom*), a new book every few months
    is no surprise.
54. [Michelangelo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5592)
    ([2003/04/18/1481787](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E1D7163AF93BA25757C0A9659C8B63))

    ([2003/04/20/1482221](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E3DF133BF933A15757C0A9659C8B63))
    It was like **the Ben Johnson of** *goats*!

    ([2003/04/20/1482270](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03EFD7113BF933A15757C0A9659C8B63))
    Caushun says there were labels that wanted to turn him into a
    house-music artist or into **the RuPaul of** *hip-hop*, but he said
    no.
57. [Maurice Béjart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q217764)
    ([2003/04/21/1482749](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E2DD133AF932A15757C0A9659C8B63))

    He talks about fires of the past with a kind of melancholy
    nostalgia, like **a Harold Bloom of** *the fire buffs\' world*.
59. [Pablo Picasso](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5593)
    ([2003/04/27/1484223](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E4D7173DF934A15757C0A9659C8B63))
    Pierre Hermé, a Frenchman who was once called **the Picasso of**

    ([2003/05/01/1485294](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E7D81F3DF932A35756C0A9659C8B63))
    But at other times, the conversation was reminiscent of dinner
    parties with the high and mighty during which the hostess asks the
    powerful man to her left a fawning question -- \'\'Who is **the
    Barry Diller of** *the Democratic Party*?\'\'
61. [Richard Perle](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q966859)
    ([2003/05/04/1485914](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E4D9133DF937A35756C0A9659C8B63))
    Even Shingo Nishimura, a staunch parliamentary militarist who was
    described to me as \'\'**the Richard Perle of** *Japan*\'\' (he was
    once fired from the cabinet for lamenting Japan\'s nuclear
    impotence), said he does not favor Japan producing nuclear weapons.
62. [Jerry Springer](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q27214)
    ([2003/05/04/1485970](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E7D8113DF937A35756C0A9659C8B63))
    He\'s like **the Jerry Springer of** *rap*,\'\' said DJ Goldfinger,
    the host of a popular Friday night hip-hop party in Manhattan.

    But the manipulative and titanically smug Laingian therapist she
    runs off with in Vienna is **a Mr. Wrong of** *a variety* that, with

    One person who still has decidedly mixed feelings about the
    publicity is a 40-year-old photographer and filmmaker named Nate

    Isabella Beeton, **the Fannie Farmer of** *Britain*, used the terms

    ([2003/06/11/1495909](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03EFD91339F932A25755C0A9659C8B63))
    Mr. Ben-Israel is **the Manolo Blahnik of** *wedding cakes*, a
    high-priced craftsman who knows that just as beautiful shoes are

    Although Phillips cuts a sufficiently glamorous figure to earn him

    Aside from hotel renovations, Mr. Van Meter said other signs of
    growth were making the area more appealing to the kind of New
    Yorkers who pick and choose where to make cameo appearances as if
    they were Bill Clinton -- new restaurants with \'\'real chefs\'\'
    (\'\'When I read that chef Susanna Foo, considered **the David
    Bouley of** *Philadelphia*, is launching a restaurant in Atlantic
    City, I was floored -- in a good way,\'\' he said), and new clubs

    In such a situation, being a superstud -- **the Errol Flynn of**

    Gertrude Berg, the accentless, Columbia University-educated
    granddaughter of immigrants who created, produced, wrote and starred
    in the show (she played Molly), became **the Oprah Winfrey of** *her
    time*, a widely beloved entrepreneur who eventually branched into

    ability to touch everyone\'s common humanity.

    The show, which is the latest opus by David Simon, the journalist
    turned producer who has become, with \'\'Homicide\'\' and \'\'The
    Corner,\'\' **the Balzac of** *postindustrial Maryland*, takes what
    might have looked like an exhausted set of premises -- a motley
    squad of detectives investigating homicides, drug trafficking and
    union corruption -- and infuses them with surprising realism.
99. [Stephen King](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q39829)
    ([2003/07/21/1506165](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE6DB1F3CF932A15754C0A9659C8B63))
    She\'s like **the Stephen King of** *our genre*,\'\' Ms. Lynch said,
    and then amended that to \'\'Stephen King is the Nora Roberts of his
    genre,\'\' as her friend and writing partner, Cai Smith, from
    Wisconsin, nodded her head in agreement.

    He did it, rumbling down Fifth Avenue 100 years ago today and
    becoming what a transportation specialist at the Smithsonian
    Institution calls \'\'**the Charles Lindbergh of** *1903*, no
    question about it.\'\'
104. [Simon Cowell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q162629)

    (You might say he\'s **the George Steinbrenner of** *hip-hop*,
    except that P. Diddy insists on playing, too.)
107. [Michelangelo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5592)
    ([2003/08/02/1508990](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06E6D8133EF931A3575BC0A9659C8B63))

    Until Ms. Shwari makes good on her dream to be **the Janet Jackson

    For different reasons, a quick evening visit to the Chesapeake Club,
    the inn\'s informal restaurant, made us wish we\'d ordered less: the
    Caesar salad was fine, but the artichoke, spinach and crab fondue
    was lukewarm and bland, and half a dozen heavily breaded chicken
    fingers were so huge they must have come from **the King Kong of**
    *fowl*.
113. [Jesus Christ](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q302)
    ([2003/08/13/1511600](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E0DF1E31F930A2575BC0A9659C8B63))

    Based on the true story of Michael Alig, **the Peter Pan of** *the
    New York club kids of the 1980\'s*, this familiar tale of big-city

    decades, creating the ideology of Juche, or self-sufficiency, that
    was the bedrock of Kim Il Sung\'s regime and remains in place today

    The East Is Red,\'\' photographed in volcanic color, splashes its
    propaganda in terms so simple that the scenes become almost
    Brechtian; more specifically, it\'s a crude Minnelli musical

146. [Carl Sagan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q410)
    ([2003/10/26/1530026](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE7D8133EF935A15753C1A9659C8B63))
    Dr. Greene is **the Carl Sagan of** *this new multidimensional
    cosmos*, diving through wormholes to travel instantaneously the

    encountering multiple disconnected copies of himself in the quantum

    liquid instead.

    Not only has he managed to get himself talked about (\'\'Dale Peck
    is **the Michael Ovitz of** *the literary world*,\'\' says the
    literary agent Bonnie Nadell); he has managed to stir up a debate
    over the practice of book reviewing -- its status, its value, its

    The Guardian called Cameron \'\'**the Annie Leibovitz of** *her

    and The Independent said her portraits of the famous were
    \'\'publicity shots to die for.\'\'

    The Alamo was, as Steve Harrigan likes to say, a story of second
    chances: Crockett, **the Arnold Schwarzenegger of** *his time*, was
    moving from celebrity to politics; Travis, a young and untested
    lawyer turned soldier, was searching for gravitas.
155. [John Coltrane](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7346)
    ([2003/11/02/1531956](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E5D61630F931A35752C1A9659C8B63))

    ([2003/11/02/1532193](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E7DB1030F931A35752C1A9659C8B63))
    Donald Scarinci, a Hudson County attorney who was Mr. Doria\'s
    counsel in the speaker\'s office, described his former boss as

    legendary Texan who served as House speaker for all but four years
    from 1940 to 1961.
157. [Moses](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9077)
    ([2003/11/06/1533041](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E7DC1739F935A35752C1A9659C8B63))
    He is not just a beloved former president; he is **the Moses of**

    ([2003/11/09/1534152](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DEFDB1430F93AA35752C1A9659C8B63))
    Thus begins a love story that drives this new memoir (the second of
    what looks to be a series, initiated two years ago with the
    publication of \'\'Country Matters,\'\' which earned its
    British-born author the reputation of being **the Peter Mayle of**

    Also, Philadelphia had two giants in the fields of architecture and
    city planning: Kahn and the legendary Ed Bacon, **the Daniel Burnham
    of** *postwar American planning*.
160. [James Bond](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2009573)
    ([2003/11/09/1534208](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E6D61F30F93AA35752C1A9659C8B63))
    John Carpenter (Willem Dafoe), whom Crane calls \'\'**the James Bond
    of** *video nuts*,\'\' is a bad influence.
161. [Michelangelo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5592)
    ([2003/11/11/1534480](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE4D81E39F932A25752C1A9659C8B63))
    The prototype was Bill Parcells, who, while working for NBC after he
    left the Giants, was **the Michelangelo of** *saying he did not
    interview with clubs he had clearly interviewed with*.
162. [Harry Potter](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3244512)
    ([2003/11/14/1535125](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E6D81438F937A25752C1A9659C8B63))
    Aubrey (Mr. Crowe) is an ideal personification of modern executive
    authority -- **the Harry Potter of** *the managerial class*.
163. [Rich Little](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1341644)
    ([2003/11/16/1535536](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE5D71539F935A25752C1A9659C8B63))
    Happily, in the end he discovers a talent that sets him up as **the
    Rich Little of** *the elephant world*, and he wows his formerly
    scornful schoolmates with snorts that transform his trunk into a
    veritable menagerie.
164. [Holly Golightly](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q849930)
    ([2003/11/16/1535818](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403E4DC1038F935A25752C1A9659C8B63))
    Could the store that made Macaulay Culkin **the Holly Golightly of**
    *the under-12 set* disappear by Christmas?
165. [Oscar Wilde](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30875)

    ([2003/11/20/1536867](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E5D6173BF933A15752C1A9659C8B63))
    Tom Wolfe called Mr. Hartford \'\'**the Martin Luther of** *modern
    culture*,\'\' a zealot with \'\'the most flagrantly unfashionable
    taste anybody in New York had ever heard of.\'\'
167. [Johann Sebastian Bach](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1339)
    ([2003/11/27/1538569](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E2DD173AF934A15752C1A9659C8B63))
    Centenaries come and go, but celebrating the 100th anniversary of
    the birth of George Balanchine (Jan. 22, 1904) is not like an
    anniversary tribute to Bach (although Balanchine is certainly **the
    Bach of** *choreographers*).
168. [Martha Stewart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234606)
    ([2003/11/27/1538582](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E5DA173AF934A15752C1A9659C8B63))
    She was **the Martha Stewart of** *the pre-Civil War era*, filling
    up her hugely popular magazine, Godey\'s Lady\'s Book, with all
    sorts of advice about how to build a dream cottage, cook a
    seven-course dinner and decorate the perfect spring hat.
169. [D. H. Lawrence](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q34970)

    In its wake Perry is left feeling like \'\'**the D. H. Lawrence of**
    *not doing it*, the voice of all the would-be lovers who ached and
    squirmed.\'\'
170. [Napoleon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q517)

    When he died in 1904, The New York Times called him \'\'**the

    But this is not about Spurrier\'s view of himself as **the Picasso

    Love them all,\'\' Scrooge muttered emphatically; but would he ever
    cease to fret and worry, planning strategy and giving orders the

    ([2003/12/24/1545699](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E1DF1F3FF937A15751C1A9659C8B63))

    It is difficult to be loving and kind and generous, at this point,
    to Bob Knight, who, at the seemingly adult age of 63, envisions
    himself as **the General Patton of** *Hoops* and who still believes
    he can get away with any schoolyard obscene gesture simply because,
    well, he is Bob Knight, the General Patton of Hoops.

    The owner of Sumile, a Japanese pop star called Miwa Yoshida (Mr.

    The cliché of her as **the Sylvia Plath of** *photographers*,
    combined with the way her photographs direct your attention to her
    presence, can obscure the difference between what is in the pictures
    and what we might like to read into them.

    After thieves stole flowers from him recently, Mr. Price, who could

    ROBERTS -- That\'s a far cry from the man who was once called **the
    Muhammad Ali of** *dance*.

    ([2004/02/04/1556102](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0D7143BF937A35751C0A9629C8B63))

    ([2004/02/06/1556595](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E7DF103BF935A35751C0A9629C8B63))
    Eddie gets provocative lines, like \'\'The D.C. sniper is like **the

    Hailed in his time as \'\'**the Michelangelo of** *the
    menagerie*,\'\' and today as France\'s greatest animalier, or
    portrayer of animals, Antoine-Louis Barye (1796-1875) applied a

    ([2004/02/08/1557103](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E1D9153BF93BA35751C0A9629C8B63))
    And the answer is pretty much Linda Perry, the former 4 Non Blondes
    singer whose work on Pink\'s \'\'Missundaztood\'\' has turned Ms.
    Perry into **the Diane Warren of** *the edgy set*.
14. [Igor Stravinsky](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7314)
    ([2004/02/13/1558419](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E1DA103AF930A25751C0A9629C8B63))
    A screening of \'\'Off the Charts\'\' will be followed by NRBQ
    playing its favorite song-poems with the saxophonist Ellery Eskelin
    -- son of Rodd Keith, **the Stravinsky of** *song-poem composers* --
    and with the song-poem tunesmith David Fox.

    At that point, with her rafter-shaking alto and steamroller
    presence, she seemed destined to become **the Ethel Merman of** *her
    generation*, and it was fitting when she took the Merman part in a
    1987 revival of \'\'Anything Goes.\'\'
16. [Ernie Isley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5394549)

    To these eyes, Maddux has been **the Larry Bird of** *baseball*,
    unprepossessing-appearing until you had to go one-on-one with him,
    and then there was no bottom to his bag of wiles and talents.
19. [Philippe Starck](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q316906)
    ([2004/02/22/1560626](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3D7133BF931A15751C0A9629C8B63))
    Since 2001, Hardy has also created shoes for Balenciaga, in a close
    collaboration with the label\'s designer Nicolas Ghesquière that has

    But Arturo Gatti is **the Oscar De La Hoya of** *New Jersey*,\'\'
    Mr. DiBella continued, referring to the Los Angeles-based world

    ([2004/02/29/1562506](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04EFDE153CF93AA15751C0A9629C8B63))
    The Tevye of \'\'Fiddler\'\' is **the Yogi Berra of** *Anatevka*, a
    twinkly eyed, malapropism-spouting buffoon who carries on a running
    conversation with God that sounds like a monologue by a borscht belt
    comic.
25. [Michelangelo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5592)
    ([2004/03/03/1563330](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E2DA143FF930A35750C0A9629C8B63))
    Both elements enter a vastly broader and more complex world in the

    To a baby boomer, the Australian Gemma Ward, the Canadian teenager
    Heather Marks or the current Italian Vogue cover girl Lisa Cant also
    bear some resemblance to the waifs painted by the kitsch master
    Margaret Keane, as well as to subjects favored by the painter John
    Currin, whom some might call **the Margaret Keane of** *the Whitney
    Biennial set*.

    The architect of Puma\'s turnaround, its 40-year-old chief
    executive, Jochen Zeitz, said that Puma was poised to raise sales at

    shoes*.

    Ms. Minch, known by her staff as **the Imelda Marcos of** *Ryan
    Center* (her office décor is dominated by shoe-shaped ceramic

    destination whenever she takes a breather from the scramble for good
    health care for the underinsured, and in 35 percent of the cases,
    uninsured, patients who compose Ryan\'s client base.

    The portrait of Night-Shining White, from the idealizing brush of
    Han Gan, a leading horse painter of the Tang dynasty (active
    742-756) -- **the George Stubbs of** *his day*, so to speak -- is
    intended to evoke a dragon in disguise, a celestial being with
    supernatural powers.
35. [Sam Malone](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12334423)
    ([2004/03/21/1567972](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E4DA1231F932A15750C0A9629C8B63))

    In his own way, Ashton was **the Shakespeare of** *ballet*, less

    It\'s **the Pat Boone of** *energy drinks*, an upbeat, peppy blend

    But now that he is a finalist for the Hart trophy as most valuable

    That he isn\'t really a designer but a man of many parts -- rap
    artist, record producer, St. Tropez party animal and, most recently,
    Broadway star -- is probably one reason he was on his way to
    becoming **the Susan Lucci of** *fashion*.
70. [David Koresh](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q431015)
    ([2004/06/09/1588068](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE0D81630F93AA35755C0A9629C8B63))

    Ben Hogan played to win in cuffed trousers, argyle cashmere and
    bespoke spats; Arnold Palmer was **the Marlon Brando of** *golf* in

    Conceived as a dictionary encompassing 51 species, from alligator to
    zoomburb (a city in the suburbs growing faster than a boomburb) the
    guide may well establish Ms. Hayden as **the Roger Tory Peterson
    of** *sprawl*.
77. [Muhammad Ali](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36107)
    ([2004/06/18/1590211](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E2DB1639F93BA25755C0A9629C8B63))
    These two views have faced off in opposing corners of the art world
    boxing ring for the better part of a century, ever since Marcel
    Duchamp, **the Muhammad Ali of** *Western modernism*, came floating
    and stinging onto the scene and messed with the protocols and the
    expectations of the game.

    Though ingenious and witty and a fine teller of contemporary quips
    and quirks, Mr. Neate is closer to **the Cassandra of** *a doomed

    But I think she\'s getting stronger as the Olympics get closer,

    Shot on digital video by **the Rembrandt of** *the medium*, Anthony
    Dod Mantle (\'\'Dogville\'\'), the film runs a brief 75 minutes, but
    any more than that would definitely be overkill.

    Daniel Jackling has been called **the Henry Ford of** *minerals*,
    developing the process by which copper is extracted from low-grade
    ore and pioneering the open-pit copper strip mine.
88. [Tiger Woods](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q10993)
    ([2004/07/15/1596883](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06E6D8173AF936A25754C0A9629C8B63))

    And given the presence of the 1971 baby blue Volkswagen bus across
    the road, the wise bet would be Mr. Staab, something of **the Johnny
    Appleseed of** *environmental art*, who for two decades has been
    traversing the world, constructing loops, rings, stars and Mobius

    Now, many years later, Mr. McNeil has become something of **a Johnny

    would love the Carnegie International in Pittsburgh, in many ways
    **the Garbo of** *American invitational art surveys* -- revered but

    It\'s a job so stressful that it\'s burned out adults like Isaac
    Mizrahi and Todd Oldham, neither of whom had to face the possibility
    of becoming **the Gary Coleman of** *fashion* as soon as they
    stepped away from the sewing machine.

    And Mr. Mooney hopes to turn Mickey and company into **the Martha
    Stewart of** *bed, books and apparel for children*, trading as much

    Accepted wisdom is that all of these companies are suffering because

    As if that weren\'t enough, he practically invented ambient music;

    A train pulled in and Ms. Mendez -- who has become somewhat famous
    just for doing her job and unleashing her foghorn of a voice, which
    has earned her the nickname \'\'**the Ethel Merman of** *the
    subway*\'\' -- bounded into the crowd for the last time before her
    break, imposing order and enforcing manners.
131. [Jeff Suppan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3176599)
    ([2004/10/27/1622575](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04EED9153DF934A15753C1A9629C8B63))

    And, as Election Day grew ever nearer, Mr. Kerry -- who is known as
    a good \'\'closer,\'\' **the Keith Foulke of** *political
    candidates* -- seemed increasingly buoyed by the crowd.
133. [Cardinal Richelieu](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q26702)
    ([2004/10/31/1623696](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E3DA113DF932A05753C1A9629C8B63))

    This is because over the last decade Mr. Suzuki has written a series
    of horror novels and short stories that have earned him the title --
    one that alternately annoys and flatters him -- of **the Stephen
    King of** *Japan*.
135. [Pablo Picasso](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5593)
    ([2004/11/05/1624728](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03EEDD143CF936A35752C1A9629C8B63))
    Mr. Gorman, **the Picasso of** *procrastination*, proves that much

    ([2004/11/07/1625121](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E4D7113BF934A35752C1A9629C8B63))
    Hermé, **the Serena Williams of** *French sweets*, always wears
    black, so it is no surprise that his signature sablé is blackened
    with cocoa and bittersweet chocolate and spiked with challenging,
    crunchy shards of fleur de sel.
137. [Benedict Arnold](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q298237)
    ([2004/11/07/1625157](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE4D6123DF934A35752C1A9629C8B63))
    Blacks jumped on Johnson for this, and their very virulence --
    \'\'Uncle Tom Johnson,\'\' \'\'**the Benedict Arnold of** *his
    race*\'\' and \'\'a jimson weed in the nostrils of those who once
    cheered him\'\' are only some of the epithets thrown his way --
    suggests that their anger toward him was older and deeper than Ward
    represents.
138. [Ralph Nader](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q193156)
    ([2004/11/07/1625608](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E6D6123CF934A35752C1A9629C8B63))

    We shared Delft\'s wet streets with mainly Dutch tourists, drawn by
    the intimacy and beauty of its old center and probably also by
    monuments associated with William of Orange, **the George Washington
    of** *the Netherlands* who led an insurrection against the Spanish
    Hapsburgs in the 16th century.
141. [Aaron Spelling](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q295080)

    Juan Osorio, **the Aaron Spelling of** *Mexican television*, was so
    ready to gamble on Ms. Trevi\'s marketability that he signed her to
    a contract before she was acquitted; he created a soap opera, yet to
    be produced, based on her life, and figured out a way she could
    phone in her lines from jail in the event of her conviction.
142. [Eliot Spitzer](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11675)
    ([2004/11/14/1627041](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07EFDC1E3CF937A25752C1A9629C8B63))
    Back in 1997, Congressman Schumer was **the Eliot Spitzer of** *his
    day*.

    ([2004/11/14/1627093](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404EFDC1F3CF937A25752C1A9629C8B63))
    MAYBE it\'s the droopy Mets windbreaker or the scuffed black Keds,
    but Matt Matros doesn\'t look much like **the Mickey Mantle for** *a

    And here in Arkansas, you might say he grew to become **the Sam
    Walton of** *national retail politics*.
146. [Nelson Mandela](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8023)
    ([2004/11/23/1629416](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E1D8163EF930A15752C1A9629C8B63))
    Some in his party even eulogized him as **the Nelson Mandela of**
    *Pakistan*, a claim that made his rivals snicker.
147. [Walker Evans](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q363308)
    ([2004/11/25/1629819](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503EED7143EF936A15752C1A9629C8B63))
    Shomei Tomatsu is **the Walker Evans of** *Japanese photography*,

    And so Mr. Burress became **a Paul Revere for** *the movement
    against same-sex marriage*, not only sounding warnings across the
    land but also laying the groundwork for a church-based conservative
    movement that he hopes will transform Ohio politics for years to
    come.
149. [Harry Potter](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3244512)
    ([2004/11/28/1630339](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06EFD71F3FF93BA15752C1A9629C8B63))
    But even if the second phase of Yozi proceeded to a third, and the
    drink became a raging success, **the Harry Potter of** *the yogurt
    drink market*, Cristman would never pack a Yozi, or any of his other
    designs, in his own daughter\'s lunch bag.

    On the more contemporary side \'\'An Omelette and a Glass of Wine:
    Walk Elizabeth David\'s Chelsea\'\' is a tribute to **the Julia
    Child of** *England*.

    ([2004/11/28/1630401](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906EFD8173EF93BA15752C1A9629C8B63))
    The campaign picked up steam after Mr. Lavine\'s victory, and Mr.
    Suozzi began calling Mr. Lavine **the Paul Revere of** *the Fix

    ([2004/11/29/1630801](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401EFD6133EF93AA15752C1A9629C8B63))
    Is it a conflict of interest for Suze Orman, often called **the
    Oprah Winfrey of** *financial planning*, to appear as a pitchwoman
    in a campaign peddling the new \'\'Lock \'n\' Roll\'\' loan
    promotion sponsored by the General Motors Corporation?
153. [Franklin Delano Roosevelt](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8007)
    ([2004/12/05/1632484](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E5D71731F936A35751C1A9629C8B63))

    ([2004/12/08/1633053](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E6DF1231F93BA35751C1A9629C8B63))
    For an even more personal cuisine, open GOOD TEMPERED FOOD (Miramax

    With a rubbery-faced empathy that made spoken words seem beside the
    point, Lloyd was an average Joe from a modest background who hit the
    jackpot: **a Tom Hanks for** *his times*.
157. [Gloria Swanson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q229232)
    ([2004/12/12/1633980](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DEED81431F931A25751C1A9629C8B63))
    Mr. Balazs\'s first property, Chateau Marmont, could be described as
    **the Gloria Swanson of** *hotels*.

    ([2004/12/17/1635360](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E6DF1530F934A25751C1A9629C8B63))
    I think that if Bill Moyers is trying to go out as **the Michael
    Moore of** *television*, he ought to be congratulated, because he
    has succeeded,\'\' he said.
159. [Henry Ford](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8768)
    ([2004/12/19/1635940](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E4DB1530F93AA25751C1A9629C8B63))
    Mr. Dell may not quite be **the Henry Ford of** *our time*, but his
    company is certainly the Wal-Mart of the high-technology industry,
    for better or worse.
160. [Frank Capra](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q51492)
    ([2004/12/26/1637346](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E0D81330F935A15751C1A9629C8B63))
    Still others are known only to a handful of devotees, like Russ
    Meyer, **the Frank Capra of** *the big-breasted sexploitation film*;
    Katharina Dalton, who changed women\'s lives by explaining PMS;
    Mary-Ellis Bunim, who helped unleash the beast that is reality TV;
    and Sidney Morgenbesser, the kibitzing philosopher of upper
    Broadway.
161. [Pete Rose](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q739866)

    James might be called **the Pete Rose of** *funk*; deprived of Sly
    Stone\'s or Prince\'s native genius, he scrapped his way to the top.

    The article made Ms. Sontag an international celebrity, showered
    with lavish, if unintentionally ridiculous, titles (\'\'a literary
    pinup,\'\' \'\'the dark lady of American letters,\'\' \'\'**the
    Natalie Wood of** *the U.S. avant-garde*\'\').

    He (or, often, she) is **the Rodney Dangerfield of** *politics*.

    It wasn\'t Jerry Orbach addressing me, but the character he\'d
    created and so thoroughly inhabited: Lennie Briscoe, **the Jonathan
    Swift of** *the N.Y.P.D.*, quintessential tough-skinned,
    nasty-tongued, broken-hearted New Yorker.
3.  [Britney Spears](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11975)
    ([2005/01/02/1639020](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E2D61439F931A35752C0A9639C8B63))
    MERCEDES-BENZ SLK350 (base \$46,220) -- The old proto-pop SLK was
    **the Britney Spears of** *sports cars* -- a cute and perky roadster
    that few took seriously.

    ([2005/01/02/1639165](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E5D91F30F931A35752C0A9639C8B63))

    *American ex-presidents*.

    ([2005/01/03/1639329](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E6DD1239F930A35752C0A9639C8B63))
    Imagine what it is like for Parcells, having to look every morning
    at Jerry Jones, **the Mark Cuban of** *football owners* before there
    was a Mark Cuban.

    Over the last few weeks, several of the nation\'s largest buyout
    firms, including the Blackstone Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners,
    have each been not-so-discreetly talking up the possibility of
    trying to raise what would be **the Shaquille O\'Neal of** *L.B.O.*
7.  [Jack Welch](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q355314)
    ([2005/01/16/1642486](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E3D91438F935A25752C0A9639C8B63))

    But comments occasionally seem deliberately naïve, like a reference
    by Michael Farquhar, author of \'\'A Treasury of Royal Scandals,\'\'
    to Marie, with her fashion excesses, as \'\'**the Imelda Marcos of**
    *her day*.\'\'
9.  [Bobby Fischer](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41314)
    ([2005/01/18/1643049](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E2D81238F93BA25752C0A9639C8B63))
    Bill Belichick is **the Bobby Fischer of** *football*,\'\' Curtis
    Martin, the Jets\' league-leading rusher, said at his locker,

    ([2005/01/23/1644306](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E4D91138F930A15752C0A9639C8B63))

    She said that because the biography did not accept a popular image
    of Ms. Bari as \'\'**the Mother Teresa of** *the North Coast
    forests*,\'\' it had invited a showdown with \'\'bitter-enders who
    are the keepers of her flame.\'\'
13. [Bill Gates](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5284)
    ([2005/01/30/1646067](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504E0DC143BF933A05752C0A9639C8B63))
    Klaus Schwab is a genius and he\'s **the Bill Gates of**
    *symposiums* because he\'s invented Davos Man and Davos Man rules
    the world; it\'s capitalism without frontiers.\'\'

    At Davos, **the Johnny Appleseed of** *the digital era* shares his

    Sal Masekela, the host for ESPN\'s television coverage -- \'\'**the
    Jim McKay of** *X*\'\' is how he described his job -- said the most
    prevalent myth about X athletes was that there was a kind of
    morbidity to their flirtations with danger.

    Standup-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep

    Christina Makowski, the owner of Georgina, a Manhasset, N.Y., store

    Lawrence Lessig, a Stanford University professor who is a leading

    This, at a time when Henry Ward Beecher (\'\'**the Billy Graham of**
    *his era*,\'\' Professor Noll calls him) was preaching a vision of
    Southern leaders -- \'\'these guiltiest and most remorseless
    traitors,\'\' the evildoers who had \'\'drenched a continent in
    needless blood\'\'-- cast down by God into \'\'endless
    retribution.\'\'

    Watch the best-actress winner, Janet Gaynor -- **the Hilary Swank

    glistening beauty.

    It\'s tempting to call Mr. Daisey **the Michael Moore of** *the New

    ([2005/02/27/1653158](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E1DE143DF934A15751C0A9639C8B63))
    Inaugurating the wall was Wyclef Jean, who, below his name, wrote
    \'\'the first, the alpha, the beginning,\'\' lest anyone forget that

    ([2005/03/11/1656010](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E6DB173CF932A25750C0A9639C8B63))
    Mr. Rabassa is a renowned translator, of Gabriel García Márquez,
    Jorge Amado and Mario Vargas Llosa -- and of Lispector, who became,
    in the mid-20th century, one of Brazil\'s most influential writers,
    described as **the Kafka of** *Latin American fiction*.

    Mr. Zatkoff, who is now **the Buckminster Fuller of** *crab pots*,

    Well over six feet tall, muscular and shaven-headed, with a voice
    deep enough to qualify him as **the James Earl Jones of**
    *stand-up*, he commands a stage.

    I don\'t mean to be dramatic, but I think John LaValle has been
    **the Gorbachev of** *Brookhaven*, and just like Gorbachev, his fate
    was sealed because he was a product of the same corrupt system that
    he needed to destroy.\'\'
54. [Charles Atlas](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q368744)
    ([2005/04/10/1663822](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E6DD143EF933A25757C0A9639C8B63))
    Mr. Schwarzenegger appeared in Army fatigues and took Mr. Buffett --
    who may be **the Charles Atlas of** *investors* but who has the
    musculature of a chipmunk -- through a grueling workout to punish
    him for criticizing inequities in California\'s property tax system.
55. [François Truffaut](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q53002)
    ([2005/04/10/1663850](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905E6D8143EF933A25757C0A9639C8B63))

    So it takes courage, if not a touch of Brownian madness, to argue,
    as David S. Reynolds does in his absorbing new biography, \'\'John
    Brown, Abolitionist,\'\' that Brown was not **the Unabomber of**
    *his time*, but a reasonable man, well connected to his era\'s
    intellectual currents and a salutary force for change.
57. [Ruth Reichl](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2896645)
    ([2005/04/17/1665402](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05EED6153EF934A25757C0A9639C8B63))

    ([2005/04/17/1665414](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DF123EF934A25757C0A9639C8B63))
    EVER **the Madonna of** *cities*, Las Vegas -- once the home of the
    Rat Pack and then, briefly, a family friendly destination -- has
    once again reinvented itself for baby boomers and their echo-boomer
    offspring, both eager to spend whatever it takes for a taste of the
    good life.
59. [Leonardo da Vinci](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q762)
    ([2005/04/22/1666672](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E7DA1731F931A15757C0A9639C8B63))

    ([2005/04/22/1666689](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806EEDA1731F931A15757C0A9639C8B63))
    He\'s **the Tom Hanks of** *the 1920\'s*,\'\' said Suzanne Lloyd,
    Lloyd\'s granddaughter.
61. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([2005/04/22/1666692](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E3D91731F931A15757C0A9639C8B63))
    Among the Asian cuisines that New Yorkers have embraced, Chinese
    often seems to be **the Rodney Dangerfield of** *the club*, getting
    less respect than others.
62. [Samuel Beckett](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37327)
    ([2005/04/22/1666699](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01EFD91731F931A15757C0A9639C8B63))
    Mr. Eno is **a Samuel Beckett for** *the Jon Stewart generation*
    (1:10).
63. [Leonardo da Vinci](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q762)
    ([2005/04/23/1666904](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E4DA1431F930A15757C0A9639C8B63))
    We think that he is **the da Vinci of** *our time*,\'\' said
    Joseph J. Seymour, the former executive director of the Port

    ([2005/04/24/1667287](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E0DC1431F937A15757C0A9639C8B63))
    The restaurant was designed by David Rockwell, an architect and set
    designer who is **the Walt Disney of** *the New York theme dining
    world*.

    ([2005/04/26/1667895](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE0D71231F935A15757C0A9639C8B63))
    Cablevision is **the G. Gordon Liddy of** *corporations*, willing to
    hold a hand to the fire to maintain its principles.
66. [Naomi Campbell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q199369)
    ([2005/04/27/1668067](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E4DA1331F934A15757C0A9639C8B63))
    The uncombed, untethered Mr. Bolton is fabulously operatic -- **the
    Naomi Campbell of** *the Bush administration*, ready at a moment\'s
    notice to beat up on underlings.
67. [Dan Quayle](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49214)
    ([2005/04/29/1668469](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E6D71031F93AA15757C0A9639C8B63))
    A black-and-white newsreel shows him bounding onto the stage at the
    Democratic National Convention as the vice-presidential nominee,
    **the Dan Quayle of** *his time*.
68. [Nicholson Baker](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1929421)
    ([2005/05/01/1668882](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E3DB1731F932A35756C0A9639C8B63))
    But \'\'Freakonomics\'\' is so sly, finicky and micro-observant that
    the Indiana Jones comparison feels a little off -- Levitt is more
    like **the Nicholson Baker of** *economists*.
69. [Donald Trump](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686)
    ([2005/05/02/1669399](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E6DF1F31F931A35756C0A9639C8B63))

    An elegant and hardy singer, Mr. Keenlyside again proved himself a
    risk-taking actor -- **the Ralph Fiennes of** *baritones*.
71. [Stevie Nicks](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234691)
    ([2005/05/06/1670224](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904EED81730F935A35756C0A9639C8B63))
    NIGHT OF A THOUSAND STEVIES (Tonight) For devotees of **the Stevie
    Nicks of** *\'\'Rhiannon\'\' and \'\'Belladonna\'\'* this 15th
    annual lip-synch-heavy tribute to Fleetwood Mac\'s songstress is a
    chance for fans to don a diaphanous shawl and join in a night of
    white winged doves and crystal worship.
72. [Donald Trump](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686)
    ([2005/05/08/1670826](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6DF1430F93BA35756C0A9639C8B63))
    Asked if he might be considered **the Donald Trump of** *China*, Mr.
    Tang smiled.

    ([2005/05/08/1670843](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E3D91430F93BA35756C0A9639C8B63))
    Armstrong\'s song has the glow of a cocktail and the What a
    Wonderful World, with cream vanilla vodka, is **a Louis Armstrong
    of** *a drink*: round and happy and beaming with hope.
74. [Simon Cowell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q162629)
    ([2005/05/16/1672918](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E7D61E30F935A25756C0A9639C8B63))
    Ms. Brown, who had long been **the Simon Cowell of** *American
    media*, pointing a crooked Brit finger at the foibles of others,
    seems less interested in what she used to call \'\'quality heat\'\'
    than pushing her choices for quality political leaders (usually
    liberal).
75. [Tony Robbins](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q380429)
    ([2005/05/17/1673164](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805E1DF1639F934A25756C0A9639C8B63))
    Won\'t he be remembered as **the Tony Robbins of** *professional
    basketball coaches*, the self-help guru who taught Bryant, Shaquille
    O\'Neal and even Michael Jordan to look within themselves for the
    secrets of the N.B.A.
76. [Jean-Pierre Léaud](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q295834)
    ([2005/05/20/1673804](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E6D81739F933A15756C0A9639C8B63))
    Mr. Amalric, who won a 2005 César award for Best Actor for the role,
    has been called \'\'**the Jean-Pierre Léaud of** *the 90\'s*,\'\'
    and just as that actor became François Truffaut\'s nervous muse in a
    series of films spanning decades, Mr. Amalric seems destined to
    continue into the 21st century as Mr. Desplechin\'s filmic alter
    ego.
77. [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([2005/05/22/1674615](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E7D91030F931A15756C0A9639C8B63))
    Turner\'s track record was dazzling -- he \'\'won more than 350
    races, driving on any surface he could find,\'\' Edelstein writes,
    eventually earning the title of \'\'**the Babe Ruth of** *Stock-Car
    Racing*\'\' -- but his off-track record, especially in light of
    Nascar\'s efforts to remake their drivers as gassed-up Mouseketeers,
    was downright dizzying.
78. [Courtney Love](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q222071)
    ([2005/05/22/1674628](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E6D91030F931A15756C0A9639C8B63))
    Undaunted, she goes on to become **the Courtney Love of** *her
    time*: hanging out with Marcel Duchamp, composing poems that are
    like \'\'small explosions\'\' for The Little Review, parading
    through the streets in outrageous costumes (a car\'s blinking tail
    light for a bustle, a dress covered with bits of newspaper) -- and
    trying not to succumb to the madness that destroyed her mother.
79. [Derek Jeter](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q353511)
    ([2005/05/26/1675483](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E1DD1039F935A15756C0A9639C8B63))
    The class of the organization comes from Milan\'s captain, Paolo
    Maldini, **the Derek Jeter of** *soccer* -- great player, great
    leader, handsome, suave.
80. [Susan Lucci](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q242936)
    ([2005/06/03/1677264](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE6DE1738F930A35755C0A9639C8B63))
    \'), who is **the Susan Lucci of** *the Tonys*, having been
    nominated 14 times without winning.
81. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([2005/06/03/1677279](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE5DD1738F930A35755C0A9639C8B63))
    The new car that is most likely to usurp the Pinto as **the Rodney
    Dangerfield of** *collectible autos* could be the Pontiac Aztek.
82. [David Souter](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q472547)
    ([2005/06/03/1677350](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E3D81738F930A35755C0A9639C8B63))
    In Republican and business circles, William H. Donaldson has been
    viewed as **the David Souter of** *the Securities and Exchange
    Commission*, a disappointingly independent choice who sided too
    frequently with the Democrats.
83. [Elvis Presley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q303)
    ([2005/06/05/1677662](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E4DC1139F936A35755C0A9639C8B63))
    FERRAN ADRIÀ reigns as **the Elvis of** *the culinary world*, and
    his restaurant El Bulli -- found in the tiny town of Roses, two

    Racks of colored robes, with neat stitches and fitting marks, fill
    the workshop of this scholarly city\'s most famous tailor, **the
    Giorgio Armani of** *clerical clothes*, Abolfazl Arabpour.
85. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)

    It\'s **the Rodney Dangerfield of** *the agency*.
86. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([2005/06/10/1679010](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E2D71038F933A25755C0A9639C8B63))

    Montgomery.
87. [Muhammad Ali](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36107)
    ([2005/06/10/1679013](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E1D71038F933A25755C0A9639C8B63))
    His large head hovers in the air at a sardonic tilt, and I think
    wryly, \'\'He\'s **the Muhammad Ali of** *conversation*: floats like
    a butterfly, stings like a bee.\'\'
88. [Peter Paul Rubens](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5599)
    ([2005/06/10/1679091](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E7DD1138F933A25755C0A9639C8B63))

    ([2005/06/12/1679403](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E3D71638F931A25755C0A9639C8B63))
    He uncharacteristically sank 28 of 32 free throws (a clue the night
    was like none other for a notoriously poor free-throw shooter, **the
    Shaquille O\'Neal of** *his day*), and made 36 of 63 field-goal
    attempts on his typical fadeaway and finger roll.
90. [Ludwig Mies van der Rohe](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41508)
    ([2005/06/12/1679406](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE3D71638F931A25755C0A9639C8B63))
    To a man who despairs that his fiancée wants \'\'one of those
    several-tiered monstrosities\'\' for a wedding cake, she shoots
    back, \'\'Who are you, **the Mies van der Rohe of** *the pastry
    shop*?\'\'
91. [Mother Teresa](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30547)
    ([2005/06/12/1679657](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E1DF1E38F931A25755C0A9639C8B63))
    Reg is now dead, while Catherine is **the Mother Teresa of** *our
    time* and is long overdue for a Nobel Peace Prize.
92. [Karl Rove](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q311135)
    ([2005/06/13/1680036](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDE133EF930A25755C0A9639C8B63))

93. [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254)
    ([2005/06/15/1680370](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E2DE163BF936A25755C0A9639C8B63))
    As the architect of the European Union constitution, Valéry Giscard
    d\'Estaing seemed at the top of his game, praised as \'\'**the
    Mozart of** *politics*\'\' and poised to go down in history as the
    founding father of a new Europe.
94. [Grace Kelly](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3925)
    ([2005/06/16/1680534](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E4DB163BF935A25755C0A9639C8B63))
    Charlotte Jorgensen, a former dance champion who helped the actor
    John O\'Hurley (J. Peterman on \'\'Seinfeld\'\') perform a cha-cha,
    said, \'\'I\'m known as **the Grace Kelly of** *the dancing
    world*.\'\'

    He is already being called **the Crash Davis of** *tennis*, after
    the baseball catcher in the film \'\'Bull Durham,\'\' played by
    Kevin Costner, who sets a record for minor league home runs.
96. [Donald Trump](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686)
    ([2005/06/22/1682062](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E3D6133BF931A15755C0A9639C8B63))
    EVEN with his 24 restaurants in nine cities from London to Los
    Angeles, even with his four homes, his private jet and his
    television appearances -- even though he can rightfully claim the
    title of being **the Donald Trump of** *the restaurant world* --
    Jeffrey Chodorow does not seem a very happy man.
97. [Charlie Parker](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103767)
    ([2005/06/24/1682532](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503EEDB1F3BF937A15755C0A9639C8B63))
    In the 1970\'s and 80\'s, Jaco Pastorius was **the Charlie Parker
    of** *the electric bass*, spooking his colleagues with his
    brilliance; he was also a daredevil composer and record maker and
    one of the most imposing, volatile stage performers in jazz.
98. [Alice Waters](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q434513)
    ([2005/06/24/1682620](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E6D81F3BF937A15755C0A9639C8B63))
    A pioneer in the slow-zombie movement (think of him as **the Alice
    Waters of** *contemporary horror*), Mr. Romero has not joined the
    recent fad for zippy corpses, as seen in both \'\'28 Days Later\'\'
    and the remake of \'\'Dawn of the Dead.\'\'
99. [Jim Morrison](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q44301)
    ([2005/06/26/1683013](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6DF163AF935A15755C0A9639C8B63))

    Being **the Charlie Brown of** *umpires*, I felt that I owed
    everybody involved written apologies as well as a signed contract to
    never call another game.
102. [Alfred P. Sloan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q344045)
    ([2005/07/01/1684204](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E5D61531F932A35754C0A9639C8B63))
    The study cites an Institutional Investors\' article with one
    colleague referring to him as **the Alfred P. Sloan of** *Morgan
    Stanley*.
103. [Ike Turner](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q208871)
    ([2005/07/03/1684667](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E4D81731F930A35754C0A9639C8B63))
    Yes, Mr. Dylan in his book, \'\'Chronicles Volume One,\'\' lamented
    Mr. Kooper\'s status in \'\'eternal musical limbo\'\' and suggested
    he was \'\'**the Ike Turner of** *the white world*\'\' and should
    have teamed up with Janis Joplin.
104. [Arthur C. Clarke](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q47087)
    ([2005/07/03/1684831](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E3DC1331F930A35754C0A9639C8B63))
    Wells, **the Arthur C. Clarke of** *the paleoindustrial age*, once
    wrote: \'\'There is no way back into the past.
105. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([2005/07/05/1685183](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00EED71031F936A35754C0A9639C8B63))
    He virtually casts Gates as **the Rodney Dangerfield of** *war
    heroes*, convinced as he is that George Washington\'s sterling
    reputation came, to some degree, at Gates\'s expense.
106. [Evel Knievel](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q345231)
    ([2005/07/08/1685772](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE4DE1630F93BA35754C0A9639C8B63))

107. [Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q165421)
    ([2005/07/10/1686145](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DEEDB153DF933A25754C0A9639C8B63))
    As they sat together at a cafe here, Mrs. McCool said, \'\'Rona is
    like **the Jackie O. of** *Israel*,\'\' although her friend said,
    \'\'Well, no,\'\' and Mrs. McCool said, \'\'But they recognize her
    everywhere.\'\'
108. [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([2005/07/14/1687227](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E7D71230F937A25754C0A9639C8B63))
    In physique, personality and production, Ortiz could be **the Babe

109. [Paul de Man](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q353754)
    ([2005/07/17/1687750](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E5DA123DF934A25754C0A9639C8B63))
    One original-series fan called him \'\'**the Paul de Man of**
    *current science fiction*,\'\' accusing him of casually
    deconstructing the story that had been so close to their hearts for
    so long, only in order to \'\'make his mark.\'\'
110. [William Brennan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8005887)
    ([2005/07/21/1688906](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E4D7163FF932A15754C0A9639C8B63))
    But here is where conservatives and liberals may part company about
    John Roberts: Conservatives hope he will be **a William Brennan of**
    *the right*, using his intelligence and charm on behalf of his
    deeply conservative views to move the court far to the right of
    where it was under the moderate influence of Justice Sandra Day
    O\'Connor; liberals fear that conservatives are correct.
111. [David Beckham](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q10520)
    ([2005/07/26/1690071](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CEFDB123FF935A15754C0A9639C8B63))
    But it wasn\'t until Mr. Cooper, the man the English press has
    called the Brad Pitt and **the David Beckham of** *dance*, began to
    strip to his 18th-century knickers as the irresistibly
    frozen-hearted, woman-devouring Vicomte de Valmont that the first
    real frisson shot through the audience.
112. [Mr. Chips](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3268056)
    ([2005/07/28/1690536](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E5DF103FF93BA15754C0A9639C8B63))
    Seeing his students\' comedy credits made him feel like \'\'**the
    Mr. Chips of** *comedy writing*,\'\' he said.
113. [Ansel Adams](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60809)
    ([2005/07/31/1691335](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07E5D8103FF932A05754C0A9639C8B63))
    Watkins is largely forgotten today, but he was **the Ansel Adams
    of** *19th-century photography*.
114. [Ralph Nader](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q193156)
    ([2005/08/07/1692805](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E5D8103CF934A3575BC0A9639C8B63))
    Enter, at the average wine consumer\'s side, Robert M. Parker Jr.,
    who sees himself as **the Ralph Nader of** *wine*.
115. [Kathleen Turner](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q222008)
    ([2005/08/10/1693653](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E4D7173EF933A2575BC0A9639C8B63))
    It\'s **the Kathleen Turner of** *cooking implements*: a fiery diva
    at center stage.
116. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([2005/08/13/1694322](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E1DC153EF930A2575BC0A9639C8B63))
    I\'ve wanted to be **the Johnny Appleseed of** *marijuana*, so if we
    produced millions and millions of marijuana plants all over the
    world, it would be impossible for governments to eradicate or
    control all of it.\'\'
117. [Robin Hood](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q122634)
    ([2005/08/13/1694358](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E3DB153EF930A2575BC0A9639C8B63))
    The game\'s image has also improved because of players like Barry
    Greenstein, who with good reason is called **the Robin Hood of**
    *Poker*: he donates millions of dollars in tournament prize money to
    children\'s charities.
118. [Rosa Parks](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41921)
    ([2005/08/17/1695421](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9501E7DE133EF934A2575BC0A9639C8B63))

    ([2005/08/22/1696593](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E1DE113EF931A1575BC0A9639C8B63))
    He called him \'\'**the Billy the Kid of** *American
    literature*.\'\'
120. [The Hatter](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q864751)
    ([2005/08/25/1697096](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E6DD1E3EF936A1575BC0A9639C8B63))

    ([2005/08/26/1697308](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE5D81E3EF935A1575BC0A9639C8B63))
    He comes off as **the Vince Lombardi of** *space travel*, leading
    astronauts beyond their corporal capacity.
122. [Anne Frank](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4583)
    ([2005/08/28/1697630](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E0DC113CF93BA1575BC0A9639C8B63))
    Sometimes called **the Anne Frank of** *Cambodia*, Bophana has
    become a folk heroine, known for the letters and confessions she
    wrote before her torture and murder by the Khmer Rouge.
123. [Andy Roddick](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q54584)
    ([2005/08/29/1698188](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E1D81F3EF93AA1575BC0A9639C8B63))
    He is **the Andy Roddick of** *France*, the great national hope.
124. [Galileo Galilei](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q307)
    ([2005/08/30/1698348](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE2DC1631F933A0575BC0A9639C8B63))
    Whether Mr. Koizumi will be remembered as **the Galileo of**
    *Japanese politics* remains to be seen.
125. [Howard Hughes](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q189081)
    ([2005/09/04/1699273](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E3DA113CF937A3575AC0A9639C8B63))
    Kimmelman\'s trek to visit Michael Heizer\'s huge, incomplete (and
    probably unfinishable) \'\'City\'\' in the Nevada desert made the
    author call the sculptor \'\'**the Howard Hughes of** *American art*
    to Smithson\'s Buddy Holly or Judd\'s Nietzsche,\'\' and it seems
    that Heizer is as much of an enigma as his vast earthwork.
126. [Barbara Walters](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q231417)
    ([2005/09/04/1699450](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E3D81731F937A3575AC0A9639C8B63))

    With columns of poetic fog billowing through its iconic bridge, the
    bay has been **a Marilyn Monroe of** *places*, a locale to be
    worshipped from afar rather than a place to hike, skip stones, think
    deeply or simply poke around.
128. [Katie Holmes](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q174346)
    ([2005/09/10/1700749](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E5DA1331F933A2575AC0A9639C8B63))

    If Ms. Clayburgh was **the Julia Roberts of** *the late 1970\'s*,

    Ms. LuPone -- who, since we\'re playing that game, might be
    described as **the Ethel Merman of** *the 1980\'s* -- dazzled, and
    nearly deafened, New York with her lungs of brass in \'\'Evita\'\'
    and \'\'Anything Goes,\'\' but has been absent from Broadway
    musicals for more than a decade.
132. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)

    Mr. Birnbaum is **the Johnny Appleseed of** *landscape
    preservation*, rallying grass-roots organizers in places like
    Seattle and Tampa and residents of Buckland, Va., where a proposed
    eight-lane highway could threaten an 18th-century village that
    includes a former plantation and a Civil War battlefield.
133. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)

    In bestowing its 1993 National Honor Award on the center, the
    American Institute of Architects\' jury called it \'\'**the Lenny
    Bruce of** *architecture* -- bold and brilliant to some and to

135. [Henry James](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170509)
    ([2005/09/18/1703022](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905E6DD1131F93BA2575AC0A9639C8B63))
    I thought of her as **the Henry James of** *dance critics*,\'\' he
    said.
136. [Donald Trump](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686)
    ([2005/09/18/1703222](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E2DB1F31F93BA2575AC0A9639C8B63))
    George Castro, the owner of the Ritz, who is referred to by some
    people as **the Donald Trump of** *Elizabeth*, is clearly more
    honored than surprised.
137. [Jelly Roll Morton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q317128)
    ([2005/09/22/1704035](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E6DE1730F931A1575AC0A9639C8B63))
    On Thursday Mr. Barthé, who has been called **the Jelly Roll Morton
    of** *plaster*, will put on a borrowed suit and a broad-brim hat
    sent by a family member familiar with his J.R. Ewing style to accept
    a now-bittersweet award from the National Endowment for the Arts: a
    National Heritage Fellowship, which carries a no-strings grant of
    \$20,000.
138. [Errol Flynn](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q93188)
    ([2005/09/25/1704842](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E1D81730F936A1575AC0A9639C8B63))
    Built in 1927, the Sherry-Netherland is **an Errol Flynn of** *a
    building*, leaping and lunging in the air as if in a pirate duel.
139. [Brad Pitt](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q35332)
    ([2005/09/25/1705171](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E3DA1530F936A1575AC0A9639C8B63))
    Figueras, standing center, is also a Ford model who has been called
    **the Brad Pitt of** *polo players*.
140. [Thomas Edison](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8743)
    ([2005/09/27/1705321](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DEFD81530F934A1575AC0A9639C8B63))
    Bill Joy, the former Sun Microsystems scientist who\'s been called
    **the Edison of** *the Internet*, is one of the prophets of doom
    calling for restraints on researchers.
141. [Flannery O\'Connor](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234579)
    ([2005/09/30/1706071](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E6DA1330F933A0575AC0A9639C8B63))
    Arbus was a wonderful formalist and just as wonderful a storyteller
    -- **the Flannery O\'Connor of** *photography*.
142. [Sol Hurok](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4535129)
    ([2005/10/06/1707530](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E0D61130F935A35753C1A9639C8B63))
    Mr. Leventhal, who began his career in the 1930\'s as a song plugger
    for Irving Berlin, was by the early 1950\'s **the Sol Hurok of**
    *America\'s flourishing folk-music revival*.
143. [Miles Davis](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q93341)
    ([2005/10/09/1708135](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E1D61230F93AA35753C1A9639C8B63))
    If Doris Kearns Goodwin or David McCullough can lay claim to being
    **the Miles Davis of** *popular history*, Winchester is becoming the
    Kenny G. Where another author might rely on groundbreaking
    scholarship or at least narrative drive, Winchester, a geologist
    turned \'\'globe-trotting correspondent,\'\' favors a meandering
    approach laced with bons mots and fusty subject headings -- e.g.,
    \'\'The Well-Illumined Earth\'\' and, on the North American tectonic
    plate, \'\'The Plate Entire.\'\'
144. [John Major](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9559)
    ([2005/10/09/1708466](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E7DB1F30F93AA35753C1A9639C8B63))
    After a while you begin to wonder: Did I really get engaged in
    politics so I could spend months arguing about the confirmation of
    Harriet Miers, **the John Major of** *American jurisprudence*?
145. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([2005/10/09/1708539](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E1D81F30F93AA35753C1A9639C8B63))
    Bill is **the Michael Jordan of** *language*.
146. [William F. Buckley Jr.](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q378098)
    ([2005/10/09/1708539](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E1D81F30F93AA35753C1A9639C8B63))
    And I guess Karl Rove is **the Bill Buckley of** *today*, in the
    sense of nurturing the conservative movement.
147. [Roger Clemens](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q473208)
    ([2005/10/10/1708694](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805E7DE163FF933A25753C1A9639C8B63))
    For sheer arm strength at such an advanced age, Testaverde is **the
    Roger Clemens of** *pro football*.
148. [Jane Austen](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36322)
    ([2005/10/23/1711573](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E0DA173FF930A15753C1A9639C8B63))
    Mary Gaitskill made her reputation as a chilly chronicler of
    emotional brutality and sexual sadism, earning her the apt sobriquet
    \'\'**the Jane Austen of** *sickos*\'\' from one Amazon reviewer.
149. [William Shakespeare](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q692)
    ([2005/10/23/1711576](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E0DA173FF930A15753C1A9639C8B63))
    Comparisons with Dickens, who was, in a way, **the Shakespeare of**
    *the novel*, are particularly suggestive; but Ackroyd, fruitfully,
    quotes many foreign opinions, old and new, as well.
150. [John Wayne](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40531)
    ([2005/10/23/1712004](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401EFDE103FF930A15753C1A9639C8B63))
    But even as Clemens, **the John Wayne of** *pitchers*, gave a
    tough-guy answer about ignoring the aches that he had accumulated in
    22 seasons, he probably never imagined he would be in the clubhouse
    getting his hamstring treated after collecting six outs.
151. [Keith Richards](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q189599)
    ([2005/10/30/1713579](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DEEDA1E3FF933A05753C1A9639C8B63))
    He\'s becoming like **the Keith Richards of** *content*.
152. [Yogi Berra](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q367566)
    ([2005/10/30/1713665](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E4DF1F3FF933A05753C1A9639C8B63))
    For a sport that disdains most formulaic numbers -- just win, baby
    -- quarterback rating has become **the Yogi Berra of** *stats*, as
    quoted as it is confounding.
153. [Lee Strasberg](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q297945)
    ([2005/11/01/1714190](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04EFDF163EF932A35752C1A9639C8B63))
    FRIEDBERG -- Martin Har vey, **the Lee Strasberg of**
    *improvisational comedy*, died October 30, 2005.

    The Presidential, created by the singer Xavier Aeon, **the P. Diddy
    of** *Britain*, has a one-gigabyte drive and plays videos as well as
    audio.
155. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([2005/11/02/1714393](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E6DA163EF931A35752C1A9639C8B63))
    O.K., so maybe New Jersey didn\'t hit the marketing jackpot when it
    paid a New York image and branding consultant \$260,000 for research
    and a new slogan and ended up with **the Rodney Dangerfield of**
    *state boasts*: \'\'New Jersey: We\'ll Win You Over.\'\'
156. [Arthur Murray](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2865273)
    ([2005/11/04/1714895](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E1D9173EF937A35752C1A9639C8B63))
    Chad Johnson, the Bengals\' receiver who is **the Arthur Murray of**
    *the N.F.L.*, performed a rendition of \'\'Riverdance\'\' after
    scoring a touchdown against the Bears on Sept. 25.
157. [Marlon Brando](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q34012)
    ([2005/11/08/1715899](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE4D7143EF93BA35752C1A9639C8B63))
    He named his daughter Tuesday, after the actress Tuesday Weld, whom
    Sam Shepard once called \'\'**the Marlon Brando of** *women*.\'\'
158. [Rosa Parks](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41921)
    ([2005/11/08/1715934](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E3D6143EF93BA35752C1A9639C8B63))
    The world lost Rosa Parks last month, but Mukhtaran is **a Rosa
    Parks for** *the new century*: a woman simultaneously ordinary and
    extraordinary, who transcended her role and started a broad movement
    for justice.
159. [Rosa Parks](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41921)
    ([2005/11/08/1715934](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E3D6143EF93BA35752C1A9639C8B63))
    Nicholas D Kristif Op-Ed column on Mukhtaran Bibi, Pakistani woman
    who was gang-raped and went on to prosecute her attackers and become
    women\'s rights leader in her country; says what sets her apart is
    not her suffering, but her effectiveness in bringing hope, education
    and new attitudes to rural Pakistan; says her problems are not over;
    says while Pres Pervez Musharraf allowed her to visit United States,
    after first blocking trip, Pakistani intelligence agents still
    follow her everywhere; calls her **the Rosa Parks for** *a new
    century* (M)

    The artist in question, Michelangelo Merisi, known to most of us as
    Caravaggio (after his hometown outside Milan), was then among the
    most famous, innovative and copied painters in Rome -- **the Picasso
    of** *his day*, more or less.
161. [Elvis Presley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q303)
    ([2005/11/13/1717106](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E5DB153EF930A25752C1A9639C8B63))
    Anointed \'\'**the Elvis of** *cultural theory*\'\' by The Chronicle
    of Higher Education, and described on his book jackets as \'\'the
    giant of Ljubljana,\'\' the 58-year-old Mr. Zizek is a jocular,
    motormouthed theorist whose critical musings on postmodernism and
    popular culture -- rich in deeply spun allusions to the likes of
    Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch -- are inspired by the French
    psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan.
162. [Juliette Binoche](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q106275)
    ([2005/11/19/1718615](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E5DC1E3EF93AA25752C1A9639C8B63))
    It helps that she is **the Juliette Binoche of** *sopranos* and
    moves like a dancer.
163. [Osama bin Laden](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1317)
    ([2005/11/20/1718862](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DE103EF933A15752C1A9639C8B63))
    People talk about him as if he were **the Osama bin Laden of**
    *Latin America*,\'\' Shifter told me, adding that, after a recent
    lecture Shifter gave at a military institution, two American
    officers came up to him and said that Morales \'\'was a terrorist, a
    murderer, the worst thing ever.\'\'
164. [Robin Hood](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q122634)
    ([2005/11/20/1719129](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE5D81E3EF933A15752C1A9639C8B63))
    If bin Laden is **the Robin Hood of** *jihad*,\'\' the authors
    write, then Abu Musab al-Zarqawi \'\'has been its Horatio Alger, and
    Iraq his field of dreams.\'\'
165. [Michael Graves](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q314636)
    ([2005/11/22/1719542](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07E7D91F3EF931A15752C1A9639C8B63))
    He is a sort of highbrow populist, **a Michael Graves of** *men\'s
    suits*.

    ([2005/11/28/1720853](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E7DF1431F93BA15752C1A9639C8B63))
    Mr. Goto, who is 37, might even be called **the John Henry of** *the
    information age*.
167. [Billy Graham](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213550)
    ([2005/11/29/1721019](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E2DC1431F93AA15752C1A9639C8B63))
    On his deathbed, Wilmot was attended by a parson named Gilbert
    Burnet, who was a sort of celebrity chaplain -- **the Billy Graham
    of** *the 17th century*.
168. [Nellie Bly](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q230299)
    ([2005/11/30/1721221](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE0D81431F933A05752C1A9639C8B63))
    CLEMENTINE PADDLEFORD was **the Nellie Bly of** *culinary
    journalism*, a go-anywhere, taste-anything, ask-everything kind of
    reporter who traveled more than 50,000 miles a year in search of
    stories in a day when very few food editors strayed far from their
    desks.
169. [Alan Alda](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q310394)
    ([2005/11/30/1721235](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3D71431F933A05752C1A9639C8B63))
    Charles Krauthammer, in a 1989 column in The Washington Post,
    referred to \'\'the postfeminist Papa Bear\'\' as \'\'**the Alan
    Alda of** *Grizzlies*, a wimp so passive and fumbling he makes
    Dagwood Bumstead look like Batman.\'\'
170. [Stuart Sutcliffe](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q204218)
    ([2005/12/04/1722083](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E4DC1631F937A35751C1A9639C8B63))
    Paul Simonon was the cool-looking, unmusical bass player -- Gilbert
    calls him **the Stuart Sutcliffe of** *punk rock*.
171. [Jesse James](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213626)
    ([2005/12/09/1723424](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E4D71031F93AA35751C1A9639C8B63))
    How else to explain \'\'Comma Sense,\'\' which has a blurb from Ms.
    Truss and claims that the apostrophe is **the Jesse James of**
    *punctuation marks*?
172. [Boston Strangler](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2855440)
    ([2005/12/11/1723956](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DEED71331F932A25751C1A9639C8B63))
    Videocassette recorders did not, as feared, become **the Boston

173. [Jon Stewart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q211987)
    ([2005/12/11/1723997](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E7D81031F932A25751C1A9639C8B63))
    The potshots at pomposity, jokes and political references made
    Gilbert and Sullivan together \'\'**the Jon Stewart of** *their
    time*,\'\' she said.
174. [Rosa Parks](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41921)
    ([2005/12/13/1724564](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE7DA1E31F930A25751C1A9639C8B63))
    Richard Pryor was **the Rosa Parks of** *comedy*,\'\' said Chris
    Rock, in a statement.
175. [Bart Simpson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5480)
    ([2005/12/18/1725623](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E5DB1E31F93BA25751C1A9639C8B63))
    Loki is **the Bart Simpson of** *Norse mythology*, forever pulling
    pranks, forever getting caught and forever talking his way out of
    the consequences.
176. [Lawrence Welk](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q676226)
    ([2005/12/18/1725624](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504E5DB1E31F93BA25751C1A9639C8B63))
    For years, critics have savaged this music, dismissing Mannheim
    Steamroller as \'\'**the Lawrence Welk of** *New Age*.\'\'
177. [Paul Revere](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q327071)
    ([2005/12/18/1725933](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E4D61630F93BA25751C1A9639C8B63))
    He relished being called \'\'**the Paul Revere of** *journalism*\'\'
    for his knack for uncovering major stories first almost as much as
    he enjoyed being at the top of President Richard M. Nixon\'s enemies
    list.
178. [Rosa Parks](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41921)
    ([2005/12/25/1727280](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E6D91730F936A15751C1A9639C8B63))
    He might have been celebrated in his community, **the Rosa Parks
    of** *Japanese-American life*; in fact, he was shunned.
179. [Dick Clark](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q366563)
    ([2005/12/30/1728356](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00E5D91330F933A05751C1A9639C8B63))
    Danny Wright, Julian\'s wide-eyed sidekick, is agreeably played by
    Greg Kinnear, wagging his bushy tail and radiating the ageless
    boyishness that makes him **the Dick Clark of** *movie stars*.

    Once the reader despairs of ever finding out whether Smith was

    Steven P. Jobs could be considered **the Walt Disney of** *his era*,

    But when the star being interviewed is someone deeply in sync with
    run-and-gun digital video and visual tone poems -- the supreme
    example being Mr. Romanek, who is **the George Lucas of** *the video

    Of course, it is entirely possible that Marusek never set out to be
    **the John Updike of** *the Asimov set*; perhaps he simply intended
    \'\'Counting Heads\'\' to be an effective satire of life as we may
    someday know it, which it is, albeit one that might require

    So, do Charles Dierkop, an oddly appealing actor who was **the Luis
    Guzman of** *the 70\'s*, and Ed Bernard, who had appeared in
    \'\'Shaft,\'\' as Royster and Styles, funky fellow detectives prone,
    like so many vintage TV characters, to such period-defining lingo as
    \'\'bread,\'\' \'\'jive,\'\' \'\'heavy\'\' and the classic
    \'\'Freeze, turkey!\'\'

    His 1995 book, \'\'Being Digital,\'\' cemented his reputation as

    For summarizing Henry Petroski\'s importance as an explainer and
    popularizer (\'\'Engineering a Safer, More Beautiful World, One
    Failure at a Time,\'\' May 2), another phrase beats
    \'\'meistersinger of the guild\'\': **the Carl Sagan of**

    Mr. Connolly, whose two-hour show includes very few slow patches,

    This year Ms. McGowan, who once sold shoes on eBay to finance her
    research, was **a Cinderella of** *the expo*, an author with a
    unique perspective on its two extremes: the dazzling bonanza of
    lavish dinners, cocktail parties and autograph signings on the one
    hand, and on the other, the hardscrabble, entrepreneurial slog of
    trying to be heard above the din of major publicity campaigns.
79. [Chris Daughtry](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q877858)

    But in interviews, a rough outline emerges that casts Mr. Colen as
    the Richard Hatch -- albeit clothed -- or at least **the Rudy Boesch
    of** *the show\'s contemporary-art island*, and that tends to make
    Ms. Stupak, because of her already-established art connections,
    something of a diva.
82. [Salvador Dalí](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5577)
    ([2006/05/28/1764923](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9501E0D8113EF93BA15756C0A9609C8B63))
    Writing about Kustom Kulture in his book \'\'Kandy-Kolored

    The knobby tires are two and a half inches wide, and the whole thing
    weighs 44 pounds, making it **the Jerome Bettis of** *bicycles*:
    sure-footed with steamroller-like heft.

    That\'s mainly because CBS\'s David Letterman, who was **the Jon

    When **the J. K. Rowling of** *political invective* decries what she
    describes as the \'\'intolerance\'\' of the mainstream liberal
    media, it\'s a little like the Soviet Union complaining about
    oppression from Finland.
94. [Harry Winston](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2522402)
    ([2006/06/17/1769614](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E5DB1131F934A25755C0A9609C8B63))
    He\'s been called **the Harry Winston of** *the hip-hop world* and

    If Phil Mickelson sees any reason to watch a tape or a DVD of NBC\'s
    coverage of his Sunday meltdown at Winged Foot, he will hear himself
    savaged by Johnny Miller, **the Simon Cowell of** *golf criticism*,
    and watch his lousy play late in the final round.
97. [Larry Brown](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q380013)

    Even though Clemens spoke positively about his performance and was
    happy that his arm and his legs felt fine, he sounded like **the

    inside more.
99. [Dean Martin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q215359)
    ([2006/06/25/1771443](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E2D91031F936A15755C0A9609C8B63))
    White, who looks like a cross between Nick Nolte and James Dickey,
    is **the Dean Martin of** *this particular Rat Pack*; he usually
    delivers his routines while waving a lighted cigar and a glass of
    Scotch.
100. [Cassandra](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170779)

    In the play, first produced at the Public Theater in 1985, Larry is
    Ned Weeks, **the Cassandra of** *the nascent AIDS epidemic*, and
    Arthur is Ben, his diffident brother, more concerned with building
    his \$2 million house in Connecticut than with taking to the
    ramparts.

    I often joke that I am **the Richard Simmons of** *the veterinary

    The long-running controversy began in 1991, when two brothers, Randy
    and Robert Rose, who some view as **the Rosa Parks of** *the
    fly-fishing set*, defied the landowners\' restrictions and went
    fishing on the slough.

    When he was murdered in 1992 at 32, under mysterious circumstances
    after a concert in Mexico, he became something like **the Tupac
    Shakur of** *the narcocorrido*.
113. [David Hasselhoff](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q201927)
    ([2006/08/02/1780256](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6DA103FF931A3575BC0A9609C8B63))

    An elevator shaft can act as **the Typhoid Mary of** *unpleasant
    aromas*, sucking them up and distributing them throughout the
    building\'s byways, for instance, or a fish-frying neighbor may prop
    open a front door.
115. [Bono](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q834621)
    ([2006/08/11/1782058](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DEFD71F3FF932A2575BC0A9609C8B63))
    Whether he will become **the Bono of** *emo* is not clear, but this
    weekend at Radio City Music Hall, when Mr. Carrabba\'s fans join
    along in shouting his anthems, the sound should be huge.
116. [Dr. Dre](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6078)
    ([2006/08/13/1782475](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E7DF1F3FF930A2575BC0A9609C8B63))

    He is **a Richard Lewis for** *the sports set* who has been

    ([2006/08/21/1784376](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E0D6153EF932A1575BC0A9609C8B63))
    To many, Jacob Alexander is **the Larry Ellison of** *Israel* --
    minus the flash and dazzle.
119. [Leonardo da Vinci](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q762)
    ([2006/08/27/1785553](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E1DC123EF934A1575BC0A9609C8B63))
    Chanel might have had a distinctive look, but Vionnet thought of

    When Elisabeth Hasselbeck, **the Zeppo Marx of** *the foursome*,
    said she donned a bathing suit to take a bath with her baby
    daughter, Ms. O\'Donnell went wide-eyed at her prudery and recalled
    that when she took a more natural bath with her daughter, the child
    asked, \'\'When do I get my fur?\'\'
123. [Curtis Martin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q952539)
    ([2006/09/07/1788211](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1DE1731F934A3575AC0A9609C8B63))

    ([2006/09/08/1788260](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E3DC1731F93BA3575AC0A9609C8B63))
    He is also taken up by Mohammad (Charles Daniel Sandoval), a
    successful Pakistani businessman who recognizes \'\'**the Bono of**
    *Lahore*,\'\' as he hyperbolically calls Ahmad, and offers to help
    restart his musical career.
125. [Cassandra](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170779)
    ([2006/09/08/1788278](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802EEDC1731F93BA3575AC0A9609C8B63))
    Madeleine K. Albright has also objected to her portrayal, and Mr.
    Clarke, who is **the Cassandra of** *Al Qaeda* and one of the

128. [Ken Burns](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q616886)
    ([2006/09/12/1789368](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E1DF1531F931A2575AC0A9609C8B63))
    They are kind of like **the Ken Burns of** *interactive media*,\'\'

    dominated in recent years in the Info-Design category.

    It was a present from 50 when I got out of jail a year ago,\'\' said
    Mr. Yayo, a member of the G-Unit, referring to a wristwatch roughly
    the scale and diameter of a hockey puck, covered with pavé diamonds
    and designed by Jacob Arabo, **the Harry Winston of** *the
    bling-bling set*.
130. [Willie Horton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8021572)

    ([2006/09/17/1790422](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E7DD1731F934A2575AC0A9609C8B63))
    If there were any doubt, Golden\'s muckraking investigation -- he\'s
    **the Ida Tarbell of** *college admissions* -- reveals that almost
    every word uttered by representatives of the top colleges about the
    care and nuance and science of the much vaunted admissions process
    is bunk.
132. [Leonard Cohen](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1276)
    ([2006/09/17/1790547](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905E6DC1231F934A2575AC0A9609C8B63))

    ([2006/09/22/1791899](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2DF1E31F931A1575AC0A9609C8B63))
    With even 2 percent of the vote, Mr. Werner could pull enough from
    another candidate to make a difference, becoming **the Ralph Nader
    of** *Texas*, 2006.
134. [George Balanchine](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q310184)
    ([2006/09/24/1792245](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4D81031F937A1575AC0A9609C8B63))
    At the front of the room Chitresh Das, the wild-eyed man who styles

    ([2006/09/27/1792983](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9501E4D91F31F934A1575AC0A9609C8B63))

    But Mr. Shih, a man sometimes described as **the Nelson Mandela of**
    *Taiwan*, is now leading a movement that, as he acknowledged in an
    interview, is heavily composed of Nationalists, his longtime enemies
    who once ran the country under martial law.
138. [Trisha Brown](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q460833)
    ([2006/10/01/1793841](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02EFD91F31F932A35753C1A9609C8B63))
    ODILE DUBOC is **the Trisha Brown of** *French contemporary dance*,
    much admired during the late 1980\'s and early 90\'s for an
    autodidactic style that -- unlike the work of most of her
    contemporaries -- focused strongly on pure movement.
139. [Dale Carnegie](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q230762)
    ([2006/10/01/1794125](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE0D91730F932A35753C1A9609C8B63))
    On the printed page, Mr. Lewis emerges as **a Dale Carnegie of**

    ([2006/10/08/1795741](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403E2DC1230F93BA35753C1A9609C8B63))
    In the eyes of Judy Kastin, a society member and a professional
    calligrapher who teaches the craft to grade-school children in Long
    Island, Mr. Jackson is **the Bruce Springsteen of** *the quill and
    vellum set*.
141. [Homer](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6691)
    ([2006/10/10/1796120](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E6DB1330F933A25753C1A9609C8B63))

    *the insect world*.
142. [Jay Z](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q62766)
    ([2006/10/12/1796555](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07EFDD1030F931A25753C1A9609C8B63))
    (Vibe magazine reaffirmed Jay-Z\'s role as a hip-hop yardstick by

    **the Jay-Z of** *the South*?\'\')
143. [Pablo Picasso](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5593)
    ([2006/10/13/1796734](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E2D81030F930A25753C1A9609C8B63))
    As for Mr. Crumb, he\'s still **the Picasso of** *comics*: the
    unavoidable influence on all younger artists.
144. [Elvis Presley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q303)
    ([2006/10/15/1797185](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE0D71330F936A25753C1A9609C8B63))

    ([2006/10/20/1798456](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E5D81F30F933A15753C1A9609C8B63))
    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday) Robert White, the Irish tenor,

    veteran.
146. [Cicero](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1541)
    ([2006/10/22/1798936](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E5D91030F931A15753C1A9609C8B63))
    He paints an engrossing picture of the caldron of Roman politics and
    presents **a Cicero for** *our own times*, a man who is the lineal
    ancestor of the modern career politician.
147. [Beau Brummell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q561019)
    ([2006/10/22/1798941](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E4D91030F931A15753C1A9609C8B63))
    Powers has chosen a brain disorder that doubles as handy metaphor
    for human miscommunication of all kinds, and then added one more
    element to the mix, in the form of Gerald Weber -- \'\'the natty
    neuroscientist,\'\' \'\'**the Beau Brummell of** *brain
    research*\'\' -- who comes to town to lend a hand, or at least
    gather material for his collection of psychological oddities.
148. [Wieland Wagner](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60465)
    ([2006/10/22/1799005](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E3D71E30F931A15753C1A9609C8B63))

    Such comparisons have earned Mr. Marden a kind of flame-keeper
    status -- something like **the Giorgio Morandi of** *radical
    abstraction*, a maker of inordinately beautiful, exquisitely made
    (and expensive) artworks.
151. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)

    Their ad is an excerpt from Jay-Z\'s video of \'\'Show Me What You

    Hanns Weinberg was **the Joseph Duveen of** *antique porcelain*,\'\'
    said Ms. Beiny, comparing her grandfather to the flamboyant
    early-20th-century dealer who sold old master paintings to American
    tycoons.
154. [Julia Roberts](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40523)

    Frederic Collignon, a 30-year-old who works as a car salesman in

    Curvaceous, cuddlesome and irresistibly charming, the
    \'\'Introduction and Allegro\'\' is something like **the Marilyn
    Monroe of** *the classical-music repertory*.
159. [Mark Twain](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7245)
    ([2006/11/10/1803630](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407EEDC1F3FF933A25752C1A9609C8B63))

    ([2006/11/12/1804014](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E6DA113FF931A25752C1A9609C8B63))
    A mighty wind, though, is just the beginning of basic gross-out, and
    Santiago Segura is **the Hieronymus Bosch of** *gross*.

    This documentary looks at some of the celebrities whose faces have
    replaced the ubiquitous images of the fallen leader, including Majed
    Yassin, an up-and-coming comic, and Shaima Zubeir, who is sometimes
    called **the Oprah of** *Iraq*.

    Otherwise, he\'s **the George Washington of** *popular culture*:
    familiar but indistinct, ubiquitous but remote.
167. [William Shakespeare](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q692)
    ([2006/12/04/1809466](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E5DA1F3EF937A35751C1A9609C8B63))

    For Mr. Stone, the history lesson began five years ago, when, as a
    new principal, he squeezed \$40,000 out of an already tight budget
    to open a weight-training room for the Indians, which had been **the
    Rodney Dangerfield of** *teams in the city*, and hired a storied
    former high school running back, Altarik White, as coach to lead
    them.
169. [Emmitt Smith](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1338802)
    ([2006/12/06/1809897](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E2DB1631F935A35751C1A9609C8B63))
    Elam might have had more luck if he had channeled Tommy Davis, **the

170. [John Wooden](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q551032)
    ([2006/12/08/1810379](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E2D91731F93BA35751C1A9609C8B63))
    Years before her mother would co-write a book with Anson Dorrance --
    **the John Wooden of** *women\'s college soccer*, whose Tar Heel
    program spawned, among others, Mia Hamm -- Yael was insisting that
    was where she would go.

    But Lawson, presumably viewing Oldham as **the Ken Jennings of**
    *criminalia*, falls prey to the common trap of letting only the
    caged canary sing.
172. [Joseph Stalin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q855)
    ([2006/12/10/1810666](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03EFDE1631F933A25751C1A9609C8B63))

    Though Foujita had a fashion sense that made him look like **the
    Elton John of** *Montparnasse* (he favored earrings, bangs and
    show-stopping homemade costumes), and though he is seen here hand in
    hand with a male Japanese friend during their shared tunic-wearing
    phase, he is viewed by Ms. Birnbaum strictly as a lady-killer.
176. [Barbra Streisand](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4636)

    Bound for Albuquerque with the loquacious Richard Feynman, **the
    Neal Cassady of** *physics*, at the wheel, the two scientists talked
    nonstop about the morality of nuclear weapons and, when they had
    exhausted that subject, how photons dance with electrons to produce
    the physical world.

    Genre buffs will enjoy seeing Liu Chia-liang, the veteran director
    (\'\'The Eight Diagram Pole Fighter,\'\' \'\'The 36th Chamber of
    Shaolin\'\') who might be described as **the John Ford of** *Kung
    Fu*, in a leading role, though the film\'s other pleasures are
    sparse.

    Wayne\'s Web site is full of references to him as \'\'the king of
    Vegas,\'\' \'\'the Warren Buffett\'\' of gambling, \'\'the oddsmaker
    of everything in the world,\'\' **the Tony Robbins of** *gambling*.
8.  [Slobodan Milošević](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q47139)

    In April 1976, Clifford Terry wrote in The Chicago Tribune about the
    actress Louise Lasser, whose role in the TV series \'\'Mary Hartman,
    Mary Hartman\'\' was \'\'becoming a media darling, sort of **the

    Mandela of** *Mozambique*.
15. [Ann Coulter](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q266611)
    ([2007/02/06/1824127](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E7DA133FF935A35751C0A9619C8B63))
    With this book, Dinesh D\'Souza, the Rishwain research scholar at

    **the Ann Coulter of** *the think tank set*.

    While it\'s tempting to dismiss him as **the Shirley MacLaine of**
    *fashion*, Mugler moonwalks it like he talks it and has steadfastly
    adhered to his fantastical aesthetic since the early 1970s.

    ([2007/02/27/1829251](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE6DA1E3EF934A15751C0A9619C8B63))
    It\'s time we stopped being **the Rodney Dangerfield of**
    *presidential primaries* and sent a clear message to candidates,\'\'
    Senate President Richard J. Codey said.
28. [Al Gore](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q19673)
    ([2007/03/03/1830023](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E4DE1731F930A35750C0A9619C8B63))
    He is a bit like **the Al Gore of** *fashion*: it took a while for
    people to get his message.
29. [Ringo Starr](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2632)
    ([2007/03/03/1830035](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E0DE1731F930A35750C0A9619C8B63))
    Mary Magdalene is **the Ringo of** *this inquiry*.
30. [Tiger Woods](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q10993)
    ([2007/03/03/1830102](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE2DC1731F930A35750C0A9619C8B63))
    When **the Tiger Woods of** *politics* goes to a civil rights
    commemoration in Selma, Ala., this weekend -- just as the story
    breaks that his white ancestors had slaves -- he will compete for
    attention with Hillary and the man billed as the first black
    president.
31. [Peter Max](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q215805)
    ([2007/03/04/1830465](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E6DA1631F937A35750C0A9619C8B63))
    In the 1960s, Mr. Colani in his Nehru jackets was **the Peter Max
    of** *design* and was known around the world.
32. [Derrick Brooks](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q93843)
    ([2007/03/09/1831690](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506EFD61231F93AA35750C0A9619C8B63))
    I want you to be **the Derrick Brooks of** *this defense*.
33. [Marcus Aurelius Antoninus](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1430)
    ([2007/03/11/1831985](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E0DF1631F932A25750C0A9619C8B63))
    Reginald Hill\'s crude and canny policeman (\'\'**the Marcus
    Aurelius of** *mid-Yorkshire*\'\' to those who love him) is nothing
    less than a force of nature in these idiosyncratic procedurals, and
    the act of terrorism that has his life hanging by a thread may pose
    an even graver threat to the natural order of his kind of genre
    novel.
34. [Mr. Chips](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3268056)
    ([2007/03/11/1832328](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E0D91331F932A25750C0A9619C8B63))
    Dealing with scrutiny is one of many aspects of an unusual
    on-the-job education he is receiving from Mr. Kaplan, who has called
    himself **the Mr. Chips of** *New York journalism*, greeting each
    arriving class of boys (and girls), whose youth never changes.
35. [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254)
    ([2007/03/13/1832608](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E6D71031F930A25750C0A9619C8B63))
    Colleagues have teasingly called Dr. Tao a rock star and **the
    Mozart of** *Math*.
36. [George Mason](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q532329)
    ([2007/03/15/1833173](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E0DC1E31F936A25750C0A9619C8B63))
    Everybody is talking about which team will be **the George Mason
    of** *this year\'s tournament*, meaning the charming outsider that
    made a run to the Final Four last year.
37. [Carmelo Anthony](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q129041)
    ([2007/03/15/1833173](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E0DC1E31F936A25750C0A9619C8B63))
    The real issue is who will be **the Carmelo Anthony of** *this
    year*, a reference to the man among boys who led Syracuse to its
    national title in 2003, as a freshman, and then turned pro.
38. [Lenny Wilkens](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q316161)
    ([2007/03/16/1833380](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E6DD1F31F935A25750C0A9619C8B63))
    Law is the smooth lefty point guard who just might be **the Lenny
    Wilkens of** *the next decade*.
39. [Louis Pasteur](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q529)
    ([2007/03/18/1833651](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E3D61231F93BA25750C0A9619C8B63))
    He acts as if he were **the Louis Pasteur of** *poverty*,
    identifying its forms for the first time through the lens of some
    sociological microscope.
40. [John Pawson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1036920)
    ([2007/03/22/1834641](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E2DF1430F931A15750C0A9619C8B63))
    The pieces are undeniably chic, especially those by David Netto
    (**the John Pawson of** *the nursery set*) and Ooba, whose
    Eames-like bassinette (\$600) could be part of MoMA\'s permanent
    collection.
41. [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254)
    ([2007/03/24/1835075](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E3DA1530F937A15750C0A9619C8B63))
    But if there was honor in being **the Mozart of** \'\'*The Mole
    People*\'\' (1956), there was little glory.
42. [Donatella Versace](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q229437)
    ([2007/03/25/1835279](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E4DF1631F936A15750C0A9619C8B63))
    For Laura Sorbatti, Marco\'s cousin and the owner of the firm Icas,
    whose love of hot pants and sunlamps has made her **the Donatella
    Versace of** *the hat world*, that chapeau is a hideous cap with the
    word \'\'gold\'\' picked out in rhinestones.
43. [Josephine Baker](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q151972)
    ([2007/03/25/1835638](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE2D71530F936A15750C0A9619C8B63))
    You might not necessarily fall for the charms of the woman who has
    been referred to as a black Bardot or an African Marilyn or **a
    Josephine Baker for** *our era*.
44. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([2007/03/28/1836163](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E4DD1330F93BA15750C0A9619C8B63))
    Each factory has a basketball team, and Mr. Thomas, a first-round
    draft pick, emerges as **the Michael Jordan of** *the South Korean
    penal system*.
45. [Meryl Streep](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q873)
    ([2007/04/01/1837057](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9501E0DA1230F932A35757C0A9619C8B63))
    I wanted **the Meryl Streep of** *toasters*, a Hepburn; either would
    do.
46. [Alice Waters](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q434513)
    ([2007/04/04/1837956](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2D81F30F937A35757C0A9619C8B63))
    Although Gavin Newsom, the mayor of San Francisco, recently weighed
    in on the 2007 Farm Bill and many mayors have taken up the
    anti-obesity cause, no mayor of a large urban city has stood up and
    become, in essence, **the Alice Waters of** *city food politics*.
47. [Monty Hall](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q936132)
    ([2007/04/09/1839119](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E5D7143FF93AA35757C0A9619C8B63))
    Miles S. Nadal, **the Monty Hall of** *Madison Avenue*, is at it
    again, doing what he loves to do best: making deals.
48. [Wilhelm Furtwängler](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q57285)
    ([2007/04/10/1839266](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E6DD153FF933A25757C0A9619C8B63))
    Sometimes his spacious timing and his feel for musical architecture
    make him seem **the Wilhelm Furtwängler of** *early-music
    conductors*.
49. [Michelangelo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5592)
    ([2007/04/12/1839640](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE4DD123FF931A25757C0A9619C8B63))
    Mr. Gunn is **the Michelangelo of** *the form*.
50. [Will Rogers](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q457840)
    ([2007/04/13/1839862](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E3DE133FF930A25757C0A9619C8B63))
    But he doesn\'t coast on the plain-spoken wisdom of a character
    presented as **the Will Rogers of** *jurisprudence*.
51. [Leni Riefenstahl](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q55415)
    ([2007/04/13/1839968](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905EFDA133FF930A25757C0A9619C8B63))
    In a March 28 op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal, she warned
    Mr. Spielberg that he could \'\'go down in history as **the Leni
    Riefenstahl of** *the Beijing Games*,\'\' a reference to a German
    filmmaker who made Nazi propaganda films.
52. [Ridley Scott](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q56005)
    ([2007/04/15/1840317](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403E1D7153FF936A25757C0A9619C8B63))
    Mr. Lawrence, whose previous movie was \'\'Lantana,\'\' an
    Altmanesque story of multiple strands about four unhappy couples, is
    **the Ridley Scott of** *Australia*, the country\'s most successful
    director of television commercials.
53. [Albert Pujols](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q148726)
    ([2007/04/15/1840597](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DC103FF936A25757C0A9619C8B63))
    He is **the Albert Pujols of** *fantasy sports*, a player who
    consistently produces, a player who is money in the bank.\'\'
54. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([2007/04/17/1841042](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E3D7113FF934A25757C0A9619C8B63))
    Billed as **the Michael Jordan of** *hockey* by a former Lightning
    owner, Lecavalier appeared to be on a career path more like Sam
    Bowie\'s, his 37 points in 76 games in his fourth season seeming to
    cement his underachieving status.
55. [Will Rogers](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q457840)
    ([2007/04/20/1841505](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E7DE1F3FF933A15757C0A9619C8B63))
    Be grateful that the cast includes Christopher Plummer, in savory
    form as **a Will Rogers of** *jurisprudence*.
56. [Isadora Duncan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q483512)
    ([2007/04/20/1841510](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E5DB1F3FF933A15757C0A9619C8B63))
    It\'s a small bronze sculpture, not nine inches tall, **the Isadora
    Duncan of** *ancient Alexandria*.
57. [Tiger Woods](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q10993)
    ([2007/04/22/1842189](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E3DC163EF931A15757C0A9619C8B63))
    Mr. Johannson calls Mr. Ley \'\'**the Tiger Woods of** *micro
    golfers*.\'\'
58. [Miles Davis](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q93341)
    ([2007/04/22/1842224](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E4D9163EF931A15757C0A9619C8B63))
    He has become a great improviser, **the Miles Davis of** *the war*.
59. [Henry Ford](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8768)
    ([2007/04/24/1842575](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04EEDF143EF937A15757C0A9619C8B63))
    Vern told me he wanted to be **the Henry Ford of** *aviation*.\'\'
60. [Larry King](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213430)
    ([2007/04/25/1842866](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E0D8143EF936A15757C0A9619C8B63))
    Mr. Rose is **a Larry King for** *Mensa members*; he is more genteel
    and cultivated than his brash CNN rival, but he, too, conducts a
    conversation, not an interview.
61. [J. D. Salinger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q79904)
    ([2007/04/29/1843943](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE5DD133EF93AA15757C0A9619C8B63))
    Woods is a schedule recluse, **the J. D. Salinger of** *golf*.
62. [Ernest Hemingway](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23434)
    ([2007/04/30/1844006](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE5DC133EF933A05757C0A9619C8B63))
    Mr. Browne also points out that when he introduced Mr. Zevon to an
    audience as \'\'**the Ernest Hemingway of** *the twelve-string
    guitar*,\'\' Mr. Zevon said he was more like Charles Bronson.
63. [Alfred Hitchcock](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7374)
    ([2007/05/02/1844502](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02EEDC103EF931A35756C0A9619C8B63))
    Clomid is **the Alfred Hitchcock of** *drugs*, with its profile in
    at least one scene of every baseball steroid saga.
64. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([2007/05/03/1844722](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E5D7103EF930A35756C0A9619C8B63))
    He\'s **the Michael Jordan of** *boxing*.\'\'
65. [L. Ron Hubbard](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q216896)
    ([2007/05/06/1845209](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEEDD133EF935A35756C0A9619C8B63))
    Once the reader despairs of ever finding out whether Smith was
    God\'s own spokesman or **the L. Ron Hubbard of** *his day*, it\'s
    possible to enjoy a tale that\'s as colorful, suspenseful and
    unlikely as any in American history,\'\' Walter Kirn wrote here.
66. [Augustine of Hippo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8018)
    ([2007/05/13/1846872](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E4DA113EF930A25756C0A9619C8B63))
    It has always been convenient to see John Donne (1572-1631) as **the
    St. Augustine of** *English letters*, made priestly and pure in his
    own good time, and not too soon to have produced the brainy carnal
    thrustings of his early love poems.
67. [Zsa Zsa Gabor](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q207405)
    ([2007/05/17/1847901](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E3DE1031F934A25756C0A9619C8B63))
    We were thrilled to discover she was a rather fancy type known as a
    Frizzle -- **the Zsa Zsa Gabor of** *chickens*.
68. [Pablo Picasso](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5593)
    ([2007/05/18/1848087](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04EFD81031F93BA25756C0A9619C8B63))
    The 18th-century painter and calligrapher Ike Taiga was something
    like **the Pablo Picasso of** *Japan*.
69. [Martha Stewart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234606)
    ([2007/05/20/1848574](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500EFDB1331F933A15756C0A9619C8B63))
    THE SECRET LIFE OF MRS. BEETON (13, 49) Anna Madeley plays Isabella
    Beeton, whose \'\'Book of Household Management\'\' sold millions of
    copies and made her **the Martha Stewart of** *1860s Britain*, in
    this \'\'Masterpiece Theater\'\' biopic.
70. [Walt Disney](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8704)
    ([2007/05/20/1848597](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E5DA1331F933A15756C0A9619C8B63))
    Even the death of Bambi\'s mother pales in comparison to the bloody
    war between a mining camp and the resident spirits of a mountain
    forest at the center of Hayao Miyazaki\'s \'\'Princess Mononoke,\'\'
    a 1997 film by the animator most often called **the Walt Disney of**
    *Japan*.
71. [Thomas Paine](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q126462)
    ([2007/05/20/1848767](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04EEDA1131F933A15756C0A9619C8B63))
    You\'re going to see a real revolution,\'\' she predicted, sounding
    a bit like **a Thomas Paine of** *retro play*.
72. [P. T. Barnum](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766)
    ([2007/05/21/1849039](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D61E31F932A15756C0A9619C8B63))
    He\'s still **the P. T. Barnum of** *activist cinema*, but he no
    longer runs the entire circus directly from the spotlight.
73. [Ted Turner](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q193368)
    ([2007/05/27/1850120](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE1D91F31F934A15756C0A9619C8B63))
    You could think of him as **the Ted Turner of** *great moments in
    sports history*, except that Mr. Kreindler doesn\'t rely on
    computerized colorization but instead conducts painstaking research
    to ensure that the hues he chooses are accurate.
74. [P. T. Barnum](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766)
    ([2007/06/01/1851208](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DEEDD1530F932A35755C0A9619C8B63))
    Mr. Johnson, who had been a crew member on Jack London\'s ill-fated
    1907 voyage on the Snark, was **the P. T. Barnum of** *the lecture
    circuit* and one of the earliest adventure-film makers.
75. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([2007/06/03/1851623](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01EED61630F930A35755C0A9619C8B63))
    In 1993, he attended a lecture by Terence McKenna, the \'\'geeky
    American\'\' who became **the Johnny Appleseed of** *psilocybin*.
76. [Donald Trump](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686)
    ([2007/06/03/1851887](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4DD1330F930A35755C0A9619C8B63))
    He is not **a Donald Trump of** *the Lower East Side*.
77. [Ansel Adams](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60809)
    ([2007/06/10/1853443](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E6DB1130F933A25755C0A9619C8B63))
    A 52-year-old photographer from Little Rock, Ark., Mr. McDermott may
    be **the Ansel Adams of** *Angkor*.
78. [Adolf Hitler](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q352)
    ([2007/06/10/1853459](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E0D81130F933A25755C0A9619C8B63))
    (\'\'LeftyHenry,\'\' a recent poster on a political blog, was less
    subtle in his criticism; he called Payne \'\'**the Hitler of**
    *American academics*.\'\')
79. [Michael Brown](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q336303)
    ([2007/06/11/1853778](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E5DE173FF932A25755C0A9619C8B63))
    Mr. Gonzales is **the Michael Brown of** *the Justice Department*,
    smilingly presiding over incompetence, chaos and malfeasance, while
    President Bush insists that he is doing a heck of a job.
80. [Dick Wolf](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q550381)
    ([2007/06/12/1853926](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E5DB173FF931A25755C0A9619C8B63))
    Denis Leary would seem an unlikely candidate to become **the Dick
    Wolf of** *dark*, morally muddied TV series about firefighters, cops
    and lawyers -- and perhaps no more so than on a morning last week on
    an Upper East Side playground.
81. [Arnold Schwarzenegger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2685)
    ([2007/06/13/1854107](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E4D8173FF930A25755C0A9619C8B63))
    Aldo called it **the Arnold Schwarzenegger of** *zweigelts*, and not
    coincidentally it was the most expensive zweigelt in the tasting, at
    \$28.
82. [Greta Garbo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5443)
    ([2007/06/13/1854256](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E4DE143FF930A25755C0A9619C8B63))
    We\'ll have to wait to see if David Chase, **the Garbo of**
    *goombahs* now pursued by a feral beast of disappointed
    \'\'Sopranos\'\' fans, is feeling as paranoid and thin-skinned as
    the two Tonys, and as deeply surprised by the consequences of his
    actions.
83. [Simon Cowell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q162629)
    ([2007/06/16/1854714](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E2DA153FF935A25755C0A9619C8B63))
    (She is billed as **the Simon Cowell of** *matchmaking*.)
84. [Bob Barker](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q381178)
    ([2007/06/18/1855371](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E4DD123FF93BA25755C0A9619C8B63))
    So it\'s not surprising that Simon Schama, a Columbia University
    professor, is turning into **the Bob Barker of** *art criticism*, a
    genial television host who excitedly invites viewers to come on down
    to high culture.
85. [Paul Revere](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q327071)
    ([2007/06/19/1855557](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E1DF133FF93AA25755C0A9619C8B63))
    Time magazine once nicknamed him \'\'**the Paul Revere of** *the
    environmental movement*.\'\'
