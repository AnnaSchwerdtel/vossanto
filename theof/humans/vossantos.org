20. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q762][Leonardo da Vinci]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/18/nyregion/amid-protest-bumpurs-case-nears-its-end.html][1987/02/18/0014363]]) Contending that Dr. Osborne had set himself up as judge, police expert and hand surgeon, Mr. Smirti called him *the Leonardo da Vinci of* /the Bronx/.

22. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q295107][Mr. T]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/01/us/washngton-talk-come-the-weekend-it-s-talk-show-city.html][1987/03/01/0017607]]) President Reagan is said to be a great fan of the ''McLaughlin Group'' and has called Mr. McLaughlin ''*the Mr. T of* /TV journalism/.''

Finley, *the Caligula of* /the Oakland A's/ -whose codes of style and behavior offended Mr. Kuhn's smothering sense of decorum.
27. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q327071][Paul Revere]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/13/nyregion/our-towns-trash-from-li-sits-uneasily-in-upstate-dump.html][1987/03/13/0021181]]) Mr. Blake, a retired businessman, became *the Paul Revere of* /Summit trash/.

31. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q937][Albert Einstein]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/27/arts/restaurants-442887.html][1987/03/27/0024878]]) If you are a fan of brains, you will no doubt get your fill with this enormous portion, which must come from *the Einstein of* /the calf world/.

34. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q294912][Richard Pryor]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/08/nyregion/new-aids-battlefield-addicts-world.html][1987/04/08/0028366]]) So Mr. Johnson moves through Harlem, clinical and profane in equal measure, acting as *the Richard Pryor of* /the safe sex set/.

37. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q220210][George Steinbrenner]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/12/nyregion/waterfront-race-drawing-top-names.html][1987/04/12/0029256]]) ''They are *the George Steinbrenner of* /marathons/ because they go out and buy as many names as they can, regardless of what the athlete's current condition is.

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q517][Napoleon]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/03/magazine/maxim-s-name-is-the-game.html][1987/05/03/0036760]]) This steady stream of income from the exploitation of a name synonymous with high fashion has earned him a sobriquet, *the Napoleon of* /licensors/.
49. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254][Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/10/arts/music-view-music-must-be-more-than-ritual.html][1987/05/10/0038761]]) Along with the thousands of failures, a few ritualistic pieces of musical consequence were produced, several by *the Mozart of* /the idiom/, George Crumb.

64. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1270178][George Will]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/27/us/washington-talk-press-corps-japanese-gain-perspective-covering-america.html][1987/05/27/0044071]]) Some go back to Japan to become celebrities; for example, after six years in Washington, Yoshihisa Komori is now considered *the George Will of* /newspaper columnists in Japan/.

74. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q347528][Liberace]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/26/arts/herbie-hancock-trio.html][1987/06/26/0052031]]) With a lot of flashy filigree and little swing or melodic inventiveness, Mr. Jordan threatens to become *the Liberace of* /guitar/.

89. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q739866][Pete Rose]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/23/nyregion/reluctant-candidate-headed-for-congress.html][1987/08/23/0068626]]) ''Shays is *the Pete Rose of* /the Connecticut Republican Party/, hustle, hustle, hustle,'' said Robert S.

56. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q508574][Billy Martin]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/03/sports/sports-of-the-times-giamatti-s-alert-on-crowd-control.html][1988/05/03/0141477]]) Most baseball people of that era thought that Chandler simply was out to get Durocher, *the Billy Martin of* /his time/.

P. Donleavy, Nikos Kazantzakis and Nabokov's ''Lolita'' when others were too afraid of censorship to try.
67. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q312656][Lon Chaney]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/15/opinion/observer-the-ivy-hayseed.html][1988/06/15/0153997]]) The notion has evidently got into his head that these high-class markings will harm him with the voters, for he seems intent on becoming *the Lon Chaney of* /politics/, the Man of a Thousand Faces.

85. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q342778][Pat Boone]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/04/arts/review-pop-rhythm-in-a-suit-and-tie.html][1988/08/04/0167715]]) If not for his experimental streak, Robert Palmer could be *the Pat Boone of* /the 1980's/.

88. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q209417][Wallis Simpson]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/11/sports/the-gretzky-trade-two-sides-in-edmonton-future-is-on-hold.html][1988/08/11/0169750]]) And Janet Jones, the beautiful bride in what was built up as a royal wedding here July 16, was seen as *the Wallis Simpson of* /her time/, the wife who coerced her husband into leaving.

95.

98. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4616][Marilyn Monroe]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/28/business/the-martial-arts-as-moneymakers.html][1988/08/28/0174823]]) ''He's *the Marilyn Monroe of* /this industry/,'' said Bill Groak, editor of M.A.

109. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9696][John F. Kennedy]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/25/world/for-canadian-liberals-a-crisis-in-leadership.html][1988/09/25/0182307]]) All told, the four years since he quit his corporate directorships on Bay Street to succeed Mr. Trudeau as Liberal leader have been shocking ones for Mr. Turner, whose supporters once hailed him as *the John F. Kennedy of* /Canadian politics/.
110. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q19837][Steve Jobs]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/28/business/pc-powerhouse-made-in-taiwan.html][1988/09/28/0183345]]) That Acer has come this far is something of a testament to the drive and unconventional approach of the 43-year-old Mr. Shih, who has become *the Steve Jobs of* /Taiwan/.

Barnum]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/05/garden/points-west-poor-seoul-los-angeles-says-smugly.html][1988/10/05/0185168]]) That was never more evident than at the opening ceremonies of our Olympics, staged by the longtime Hollywood producer David Wolper, *the P.

115. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36107][Muhammad Ali]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/09/magazine/the-hard-ride-of-willy-t.html][1988/10/09/0186323]]) Until recently, the muscular, middleweight Ribbs, whom the racing press once labeled *the Muhammad Ali of* /auto racing/, might have reacted to such an incident by punching Pruett out in the pits afterward.
116. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q180975][Andrew Lloyd Webber]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/10/business/next-inc-produces-a-gala-and-also-a-new-computer.html][1988/10/10/0186766]]) But more stems from Mr. Jobs's reputation as *the Andrew Lloyd Webber of* /product introductions/, a master of stage flair and special effects.

122. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766][P. T. Barnum]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/17/sports/sports-world-specials-one-of-a-kind.html][1988/10/17/0188726]]) It came from Joshua Evans, the hoopla-minded young proprietor of Lelands auction house in Allentown, Pa., who has emerged as *the P.

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q117710][Lorin Maazel]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/06/arts/review-opera-the-met-season-opens-with-cav-and-pag.html][1988/11/06/0195310]]) As we have learned through his appearances at the New York City Opera, Mr. Siciliani is something like *the Lorin Maazel of* /Italian opera conductors/.
129. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7243][Leo Tolstoy]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/13/books/the-notorious-unknown-indian.html][1988/11/13/0197859]]) Although Mr. Chaudhuri may not be what Saul Bellow would call *the Tolstoy of* /the Bengalis/, he may remind many readers of Nabokov's Pnin.
132. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q105550][Rod Laver]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/04/magazine/serving-on-dad-s-court.html][1988/12/04/0203718]]) I was also nervous about joining *the Rod Laver of* /business/ on his home court.

135. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q855][Joseph Stalin]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/06/theater/review-theater-who-was-that-chicken.html][1988/12/06/0204254]]) As a result, he is regarded as ''*the Stalin of* /Patchogue/, the Idi Amin of Long Island,'' which, along with many other aspects of the play, is a considerable overstatement.

8. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q43203][Clint Eastwood]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/16/theater/review-theater-macho-memories.html][1989/01/16/0214485]]) Mr. O'Keefe, a playwright and actor whose surreal family drama ''All Night Long'' was produced in 1984 in New York at Second Stage, might be described as *the Clint Eastwood of* /performance artists/.

2. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3355][Amelia Earhart]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/17/news/at-the-bar.html][1992/01/17/0500887]]) In New York State, it seems, *the Amelia Earhart of* /women's courtroom dress/ was one Carolyn Peck of Syracuse.
3. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421][Michael Jordan]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/24/sports/sports-of-the-times-some-teams-succeed-on-turmoil.html][1992/01/24/0502719]]) The Bills are not necessarily in trouble in Sunday's Super Bowl just because Thomas wants to be known as *the Michael Jordan of* /his team/, leaving the implication that Jim Kelly, the quarterback, is merely Scottie Pippen.
6. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q315487][Bugsy Siegel]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/26/sports/backtalk-get-ready-for-a-less-than-super-morning-after.html][1992/01/26/0503490]]) Then there's Jerry Tarkanian, the bald, towel-chewing coach at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas whose vision of populating the desert with jump-shooting urban nomads has made him, to the National Collegiate Athletic Association, *the Bugsy Siegel of* /basketball/.
7. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9960][Ronald Reagan]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/27/world/free-for-all-seen-in-philippine-vote.html][1992/01/27/0503557]]) The two candidates who top voter opinion surveys -- Senator Joseph Estrada, a grade B movie star who is sometimes described as *the Ronald Reagan of* /the Philippines/, and Miriam Defensor Santiago, a former immigration commissioner who is portraying herself as a dogged corruption fighter -- are being written off because they lack the backing of a large political machine.
8. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q44176][Hulk Hogan]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/30/nyregion/fishing-for-tourists-by-the-musconetcong.html][1992/01/30/0504397]]) In the Delaware watershed, they say, the chinook salmon, a carpetbagger from the Pacific Northwest, would be *the Hulk Hogan of* /sport fish/, pursued with little finesse by anglers whose only goal is to land the biggest fish in the shortest time.

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131237][Carl Lewis]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/15/sports/albertville-blair-strikes-gold-again-to-glide-to-us-history.html][1992/02/15/0507721]]) But even if she did not, she has at least established herself as *the Carl Lewis of* /her sport/, its dominant sprinter.

15. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q310586][Jesse Jackson]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/26/us/the-1992-campaign-republicans-marching-through-georgia-guns-firing.html][1992/02/26/0509904]]) "In some ways, he is sort of *the Jesse Jackson of* /the right/," said Mr. Gingrich of Mr. Buchanan in an interview.

17. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q54168][J. P. Morgan]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/27/business/a-new-momentum-at-mellon.html][1992/02/27/0510163]]) Meanwhile, lending to blue-chip companies, which earned Mellon the sobriquet "*the J. P.

18. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36105][Charles Bronson]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/29/theater/review-theater-a-loved-wife-her-illness-and-her-last-gift-a-tear.html][1992/02/29/0510431]]) And even his wife becomes "*the Charles Bronson of* /organic gardening/."

Bush]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/08/opinion/public-private-a-far-better-thing.html][1992/03/08/0512675]]) In that sense you are *the George Bush of* /New York City/, and what's going on here is not unlike what's going on in the Presidential races.
21. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q887520][Harold Stassen]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/08/opinion/public-private-a-far-better-thing.html][1992/03/08/0512675]]) And there's *the Harold Stassen of* /New York/, Herman Badillo, and the Paul Tsongas of New York, Richard Ravitch.

37. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q712928][Cameron Mackintosh]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/12/theater/theater-free-market-capitalism-applied-to-the-stage.html][1992/04/12/0520605]]) "I want to be *the Cameron Mackintosh of* /Poland/," Mr. Kubiak said of the producer of "Miss Saigon" and other highly profitable musicals.

73. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170596][T. E. Lawrence]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/29/arts/step-up-folks-check-it-out-nationhood.html][1994/05/29/0690176]]) If Istanbul is *the T. E. Lawrence of* /world capitals/, sword unsheathed and racing on horseback toward another clash with history, then Washington is Indiana Jones -- handsome and dashing in its porkpie hat and bullwhip, but only playing a part.
74.

41. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q311885][Patrick Henry]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/05/us/oklahoma-grandparents-turn-grief-into-a-quest.html][1996/03/05/0834527]]) He was even listed as a speaker at an April conference at Lake Tahoe that will include Louis Beam, who has served as an ambassador at large for the Aryan  Nations, a white supremacist group, and is described by admirers as "*the Patrick Henry of* /our movement/."
42. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q314805][Elliott Gould]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/08/movies/film-review-if-they-haven-t-found-love-by-30-they-ll-jump-well-ok.html][1996/03/08/0835139]]) All coy grins and daffy mugging, Mr. Stiller plays the role as if aspiring to become *the Elliott Gould of* /his generation/.
43. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1399][Niccolò Machiavelli]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/14/business/market-place-tobacco-s-broken-line-a-dealer-s-boldest-play-may-reshape-the-game.html][1996/03/14/0836529]]) For Bennett S. LeBow, *the Niccolo Machiavelli of* /the foxy deal/, yesterday's agreement to settle a giant class-action lawsuit against his Liggett Group tobacco company is being viewed as his masterpiece.
44. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q79031][Mike Tyson]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/17/sports/boxing-tyson-reclaims-his-first-championship-belt.html][1996/03/17/0837444]]) He talked of being *the Tyson of* /virtually another era/.

47. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q299331][Mario Lanza]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/24/nyregion/for-sherrill-milnes-verdi-s-perfect.html][1996/03/24/0838761]]) And I was not *the Mario Lanza of* /the school/.

50. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q212963][Samuel Adams]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/27/world/taybeh-journal-a-niche-beer-made-you-might-say-to-toast-peace.html][1996/03/27/0839520]]) "One told me I was *the Sam Adams of* /the Middle East/," Mr. Khoury said, grinning.
51. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q457840][Will Rogers]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/29/nyregion/nyc-a-potent-cure-for-the-terrors-of-rural-living.html][1996/03/29/0840002]]) The National Rifle Association -- *the Will Rogers of* /lobbying groups/, having never met a gun it didn't like -- wanted all semiautomatics back on the market, and a House majority was happy to accommodate it.
52. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q762][Leonardo da Vinci]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/01/arts/television-review-a-portrait-of-a-legend-in-spotlight-and-shadow.html][1996/04/01/0840751]]) As the critic Molly Haskell puts it, "He was *the Leonardo of* /cinema/, and she was his Mona Lisa."
53. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q303][Elvis Presley]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/08/world/soroa-journal-mexican-hide-and-seek-in-a-cuban-playground.html][1996/04/08/0842318]]) In the year that has passed since Mr. Salinas was last seen publicly, he has  become *the Elvis of* /former presidents/.
54. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1631][Édith Piaf]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/08/nyregion/chronicle-061131.html][1996/04/08/0842399]]) In a place like the Monkey Bar, I had to be able to play everything from tangos  to the songs of Om Kalsoum," the late singer he described as "*the Edith Piaf of* /Egypt/."
55. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386][Rodney Dangerfield]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/11/sports/baseball-20-million-yankee-pitcher-will-throw-in-the-minors.html][1996/04/11/0842911]]) in 25  1/3 innings) and won 44 games for the Texas Rangers over the last three years to the former Mets pitcher's 15, Rogers has inexplicably been treated like *the Rodney Dangerfield of* /the Yankee staff/.
57. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q93188][Errol Flynn]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/21/books/a-compulsion-for-music.html][1996/04/21/0845200]]) This prideful detachment was, of course, a mask: though one friend admiringly called him "*the Errol Flynn of* /losers/," others realized that Wilder was simply too unsure of his own gifts to make the fullest use of them.
58. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q319072][Rush Limbaugh]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/21/nyregion/atlantic-city-gadfly-with-a-bite.html][1996/04/21/0845244]]) Harry Hurley is "*the Rush Limbaugh of* /Atlantic City/," said a competing morning talk radio host, Don Williams of WOND-AM, whose dominance of 14,000 listeners has been challenged by Mr. Hurley's growing popularity.
60. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23][George Washington]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/25/nyregion/on-day-2-the-tug-of-romance-outweighs-the-price-of-history.html][1996/04/25/0846131]]) "To me, David Ben-Gurion is *the George Washington of* /the State of Israel/ and Jackie Kennedy was the queen of the United States," he said.
61. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3106664][T. Berry Brazelton]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/25/garden/the-housemother-of-the-show-house.html][1996/04/25/0846208]]) "I just treat them like children," said Mrs. MacDougall, *the T. Berry Brazelton of* /the decorating world/.

Gandhi, the leader of India's freedom struggle and, most Indians would say, the greatest of all its crusaders for the  poor.
69. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q303][Elvis Presley]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/06/business/business-digest-028134.html][1996/05/06/0848805]]) Why, Perhaps, It's Called Classical  If television is *the Elvis of* /communications technologies/ and the Internet is Nirvana, radio is more like Bach.
70.

71. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5950][James Brown]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/08/arts/music-in-review-032395.html][1996/05/08/0849224]]) He's *the James Brown of* /salsa/, with a tightly choreographed set and precise pop arrangements for his tunes.
72. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421][Michael Jordan]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/10/business/columbia-hca-to-pay-blue-cross-officials.html][1996/05/10/0849554]]) "Mr. Burry is *the Michael Jordan of* /integrating insurance and health care/, so he commands a pretty big salary," said William Silverman, a spokesman for Blue Cross.

74. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q720][Genghis Khan]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/17/world/lesedi-cultural-village-journal-my-hut-is-your-hut-south-africa-s-new-tourism.html][1996/05/17/0851153]]) At the fireside, Mr. Dlamini told the story of Shaka, *the Genghis Khan of* /the Zulus/, from his illegitimate birth in a minor clan to his leadership of armies that swept southern Africa in the early 19th century.
75. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q201608][Dennis Rodman]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/19/magazine/sports-extremist.html][1996/05/19/0851475]]) "You could tell she was *the Dennis Rodman of* /mountain biking/."

80. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q723274][John Robinson]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/28/nyregion/episcopal-bishop-hails-victory-on-gay-priests.html][1996/05/28/0853767]]) "If I could be remembered as *the John Robinson of* /my generation/," he said, "that would be high praise."
81. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q310839][Adlai Stevenson I]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/02/weekinreview/in-israel-fears-decide-which-road-not-to-travel.html][1996/06/02/0854862]]) It should have been no great surprise that a significant majority of  Israeli Jews would vote their fears in an anxious time, finding Mr. Peres, whose aloofness and political stumbles make him *the Adlai Stevenson of* /Israeli politics/, less credible on the issue that mattered most to them: security.
82. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q313697][Ross Perot]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/09/nyregion/about-long-island-an-unlikely-candidate-in-east-hampton.html][1996/06/09/0856237]]) "He's *the Ross Perot of* /East Hampton/," said Bruce Moore, owner of Bruce's Seafood market.

85. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386][Rodney Dangerfield]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/12/business/lexmark-makes-money-but-does-not-excite-investors.html][1996/06/12/0857282]]) ''I call Lexmark *the Rodney Dangerfield of* /printer companies/,'' said Steve Milunovich, an analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company, which co-managed the company's November offering.

Reynolds, *the Robert Moses of* /Long Beach/.
87. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421][Michael Jordan]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/14/sports/hockey-smith-s-goal-baby-blueshirts.html][1996/06/14/0857634]]) He said he would bid on free agents "if *the Michael Jordan of* /hockey/" becomes available.
88. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1398][Virgil]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/16/books/the-dammed.html][1996/06/16/0858002]]) A historian and journalist by training, he has nonetheless striven for years to bear witness to Montana history in fiction, and to become if not the Homer at least *the Virgil of* /generations of Scots who migrated to northwestern Montana before and after it became a state in 1889/.
89. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766][P. T.

Barnum of* /biotech/,  has come very close to living the myth.
91. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7322][Christopher Columbus]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/26/garden/for-germans-a-kebab-filled-with-social-significance.html][1996/06/26/0860266]]) Our goal is to be *the Christopher Columbus of* /doner/."

94. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q312348][Thurgood Marshall]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/03/opinion/single-sex-schools-and-double-standards.html][1996/07/03/0862081]]) Her decision, in fact, can be read in several ways, and not all of the interpretations are easy to reconcile with the vision of equal-treatment feminism that she championed as *the Thurgood Marshall of* /the women's movement in the 1970's/.
95. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q95034][John Barrymore]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/05/arts/happy-trails-along-the-hudson.html][1996/07/05/0862461]]) FOR most of this century, the Hudson has been *the John Barrymore of* /rivers/, noble in profile but a sorry wreck.
96. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812][Babe Ruth]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/06/nyregion/finding-way-swing-for-fences-softball-helps-recovering-addicts-learn-discipline.html][1996/07/06/0862685]]) Precious is her name, but at the plate she is the power lady, *the Babe Ruth of* /a no-nonsense league/.
97. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q327071][Paul Revere]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/06/arts/librarians-challenge-offering-internet.html][1996/07/06/0862725]]) Ms. Turock, 59, blond, with a voice like honey, has been called "*the Paul Revere of* /the Information Age/" by the Librarian of Congress, James Billington.

99. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q497827][Sam Walton]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/14/magazine/a-fundamental-problem.html][1996/07/14/0864251]]) Though little known to the general public, Dobson is *the Sam Walton of* /the family values movement/, a distributor with unparalleled reach.
100. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7245][Mark Twain]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/21/arts/the-new-sound-of-early-music.html][1996/07/21/0866407]]) The image I always have is, this is a  river town, and he's like *the Mark Twain of* /early music/.
102. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386][Rodney Dangerfield]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/25/garden/where-to-find-it-folding-chairs.html][1996/07/25/0867025]]) meetings and bridge parties, folding chairs, *the Rodney Dangerfield of* /the home-furnishings world/, are stashed in a closet when not in use.
103. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q190924][Michael Johnson]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/27/sports/sports-of-the-times-low-profile-high-drama-competition.html][1996/07/27/0867603]]) Godina, competing in his first Games, considered himself *the Michael Johnson of* /shot-putters/.
104. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1261570][Frank Gifford]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/28/sports/sports-of-the-times-our-man-on-line-one-hand-on-remote-one-on-mouse.html][1996/07/28/0867931]]) There were potshots at other commentators, most notably John Tesh, whom Todd  called "*the Frank Gifford of* /gymnastics/.
105. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7416][Margaret Thatcher]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/31/world/netanyahu-infuriates-unions-by-assault-on-welfare-state.html][1996/07/31/0868645]]) For Benjamin Netanyahu, the conservative new Prime Minister, cutting those subsidies and slashing that work force rank high in a quest to become *the Margaret Thatcher of* /Israel/.
106. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421][Michael Jordan]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/03/sports/brazil-s-female-stars-finally-have-a-medal.html][1996/08/03/0869199]]) And, of course, *the Michael Jordan of* /Brazilian basketball for the past 20 years/, has simply been known as Oscar.
108. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q190924][Michael Johnson]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/04/sports/atlanta-day-16-tennis.html][1996/08/04/0869687]]) It's one thing to win a gold medal, but the way he dominated, he was *the Michael Johnson of* /the tennis field/ today.''
109. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103767][Charlie Parker]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/09/movies/a-postcard-picture-of-a-graffiti-artist.html][1996/08/09/0870295]]) But for all its admiration, ''Basquiat'' winds up no closer to that assessment than to the critic Robert Hughes's more jaundiced one: ''Far from being *the Charlie Parker of* /SoHo/ (as his promoters claimed), he became its Jessica Savitch.''
110. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q43423][Aesop]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/09/movies/parables-that-blend-love-and-philosophy.html][1996/08/09/0870300]]) Eric Rohmer's ''Rendezvous in Paris'' is an oasis of contemplative intelligence in the summer movie season, presenting three graceful and elegant parables with the moral agility that distinguishes Mr. Rohmer as *the Aesop of* /amour/.
111. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213550][Billy Graham]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/09/arts/masterworks-on-vacation-at-the-met.html][1996/08/09/0870316]]) As in the past, the preponderance are Venetian pictures: Tiepolos, Guardis, Canalettos and a Jacopo Bellini that is surgically precise, and movingly so: a small depiction of the sallow, toothless and hollow-eyed St. Bernardino of Siena, who as a popular preacher was something like *the Billy Graham of* /Bellini's day/.
113. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q132524][Ayn Rand]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/11/books/all-this-and-heaven-too.html][1996/08/11/0870785]]) That would probably be bearable if the books weren't getting progressively less readable; but she's *the Ayn Rand of* /the spirit realm/.
114. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5592][Michelangelo]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/13/us/fleeing-the-ghost-of-1992.html][1996/08/13/0871265]]) The people who ran things four years ago are out, and people who made Republican images in happier days are back -- people like Michael J.

25. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q887520][Harold Stassen]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/18/sports/in-the-driver-s-seat-without-driver-s-education.html][1997/02/18/0909767]]) He's *the Harold Stassen of* /Daytona/.

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q344793][George Burns]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/15/science/long-evolution-of-darwin-of-20th-century.html][1997/04/15/0922983]]) That is not to say that Dr. Mayr cannot be charming, even pointedly humble, making practiced jokes about himself and his age, sounding like *the George Burns of* /evolutionary biology/.
48. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q221048][Jackie Robinson]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/19/opinion/tiger-s-double-bogey.html][1997/04/19/0923823]]) But the 21-year-old who is often described as *the Jackie Robinson of* /golf/ blew off Jackie Robinson -- and the Fan in Chief.

Barnum of* /baseball/, more than just exploding scoreboards and novelty acts, despite the indelible image of the midget Eddie Gaedel at bat.
55. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q350844][Christian Lacroix]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/06/style/for-the-bride-who-wants-a-simple-sensuous-look.html][1997/05/06/0927940]]) ''It's the Jil Sander of bridal versus *the Christian Lacroix of* /bridal/.''

62. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1770885][Knute Rockne]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/25/magazine/john-sexton-pleads-and-pleads-and-pleads-his-case.html][1997/05/25/0932244]]) Sexton was *the Knute Rockne of* /debate/.

208. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q366563][Dick Clark]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/29/movies/hairspray-actors-all-have-stories-suddenly-people-are-listening.html][2002/11/29/1444510]]) Corny Collins is ''*the Dick Clark of* /Baltimore/,'' Mr. Thorell said.

216.

219. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q352][Adolf Hitler]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/20/arts/art-in-review-andras-borocz.html][2002/12/20/1450289]]) The traditional idea is to stamp the feet to drown out any mention of Haman, *the Hitler of* /his Biblical day/; Mr. Borocz has worked up elaborate wooden toys in which shoes are activated by cranks to produce that result.
220. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386][Rodney Dangerfield]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/21/us/washington-talk-after-all-these-years-what-do-you-say-now-chevy-chase.html][2002/12/21/1450439]]) That is helping Gerald R.

221. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q28493][Ralph Fiennes]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/22/arts/music-look-what-they-re-doing-to-opera.html][2002/12/22/1450621]]) The elegant British baritone Simon Keenlyside is *the Ralph Fiennes of* /opera/, not just an affectingly restrained actor, but, as his recent Lincoln Center performances in the choreographer Trisha Brown's staging of Schubert's song cycle ''Winterreise'' made clear, an agile dancer.
222. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421][Michael Jordan]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/22/nyregion/long-island-journal-on-the-hunt-cupid-s-arrow-in-his-quiver.html][2002/12/22/1450658]]) He was introduced as *the Michael Jordan of* /hunting and fishing/.

227. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1586470][Harry Cohn]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/29/business/he-lit-up-hbo-now-he-must-run-it.html][2002/12/29/1452280]]) ''He's *the Harry Cohn of* /today/.''

Kennedy]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/19/magazine/the-makeover.html][2003/01/19/1457548]]) But how to reconcile those rumors with others that have him down as a world-class womanizer, *the Jack Kennedy of* /the Sahara/, or with the official line that lists him as a doting husband and father to his seven children?
8. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812][Babe Ruth]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/19/magazine/a-grizzly-task.html][2003/01/19/1457551]]) If Wilt Chamberlain was *the Babe Ruth of* /basketball/, the outsize figure who forever changed his game's frame of reference, then West was the sport's DiMaggio, its understated classicist.
10. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812][Babe Ruth]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/23/sports/the-ski-report-olympic-aerialist-falls-back-to-earth.html][2003/01/23/1458686]]) It was Feb. 19, 2002 and Eric Bergoust, *the Babe Ruth of* /freestyle aerials/, stood at the crest of a snowy hill making the last preparations for his final jump at the Salt Lake City Olympic Games.
13. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234163][Nell Gwyn]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/02/opinion/double-timing-the-king.html][2003/02/02/1461536]]) One can almost imagine Mrs. Simpson in the court of Charles II, the Lady Castlemaine, if not *the Nell Gwyn of* /her day/.

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1048][Julius Caesar]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/06/sports/sports-of-the-times-colts-finding-motivation-in-new-way.html][2003/02/06/1462734]]) Jim Irsay, the eccentric son of the erratic Bob Irsay, *the Caesar of* /sports carpetbaggers/, is now running the show for the Colts.

16. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q352][Adolf Hitler]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/07/opinion/war-and-wisdom.html][2003/02/07/1462973]]) The same was said of Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser, whom the West saw as *the Hitler of* /the 1950's and 1960's/.

24. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675][Johnny Appleseed]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/23/realestate/postings-housing-group-builds-for-profit-project-brooklyn-12-market-rentals-two.html][2003/02/23/1467070]]) ''We want to be *the Johnny Appleseed of* /these projects/,'' Mr. Bee said, ''so we can see more of them proliferate.''

Lehman,'' letter by letter, on a sign announcing a symposium that looked at his place in history and his place in the participants' memories.
29. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254][Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/02/magazine/ozark-spring.html][2003/03/02/1468803]]) In 1964, the United States Congress authorized that land all along the Jacks Fork River (once described by a boater as *the Mozart of* /rivers/) would be part of the 80,000-acre park, the first of the national riverways.

31. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q188955][Matthew McConaughey]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/07/movies/on-stage-and-off.html][2003/03/07/1470289]]) Rodney Gilfry, the strapping, blond baritone who has been called ''*the Matthew McConaughey of* /opera/'' (for good or bad), will star in this spring's Encores!

38. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686][Donald Trump]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/20/business/hospital-chain-is-accused-of-accounting-fraud.html][2003/03/20/1473894]]) Capitalizing on generous Medicare payments for physical rehabilitation, he built enough personal wealth to become known as *the Donald Trump of* /Birmingham/.

42. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5284][Bill Gates]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/30/books/the-global-villain.html][2003/03/30/1476700]]) One might well object that there is nothing representative about them: he talks to *the Bill Gates of* /India/; he manages to find a non-Coptic Christian family in Egypt (who complained that the Americans weren't as tough on Muslims as the Israelis were).
43. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q762][Leonardo da Vinci]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/30/magazine/style-an-eye-for-the-ladies.html][2003/03/30/1476728]]) He's very knowledgeable about fine art but has no idea who Krazy Kat is, and he's like *the Leonardo da Vinci of* /the cartoon world/.
44.

197. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234606][Martha Stewart]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/27/opinion/how-women-won-the-holidays.html][2003/11/27/1538582]]) She was *the Martha Stewart of* /the pre-Civil War era/, filling up her hugely popular magazine, Godey's Lady's Book, with all sorts of advice about how to build a dream cottage, cook a seven-course dinner and decorate the perfect spring hat.

212. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q434513][Alice Waters]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/27/us/helen-gustafson-74-dies-championed-fine-tea-in-america.html][2003/12/27/1546122]]) She was ''*the Alice Waters of* /the tea movement/,'' said a friend, Ruth Reichl, editor in chief of Gourmet magazine and former restaurant critic of The New York Times, in a reference to the founder of Chez Panisse.

109. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103767][Charlie Parker]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/24/arts/music/24jvc.html][2005/06/24/1682532]]) In the 1970's and 80's, Jaco Pastorius was *the Charlie Parker of* /the electric bass/, spooking his colleagues with his brilliance; he was also a daredevil composer and record maker and one of the most imposing, volatile stage performers in jazz.

Where another author might rely on groundbreaking scholarship or at least narrative drive, Winchester, a geologist turned ''globe-trotting correspondent,'' favors a meandering approach laced with bons mots and fusty subject headings -- e.g., ''The Well-Illumined Earth'' and, on the North American tectonic plate, ''The Plate Entire.''

97. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2685][Arnold Schwarzenegger]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/dining/reviews/13wine.html][2007/06/13/1854107]]) Aldo called it *the Arnold Schwarzenegger of* /zweigelts/, and not coincidentally it was the most expensive zweigelt in the tasting, at $28.

99. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q162629][Simon Cowell]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/16/arts/television/16tvcol.html][2007/06/16/1854714]]) (She is billed as *the Simon Cowell of* /matchmaking/.)

101. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q327071][Paul Revere]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/19/science/earth/19conv.html][2007/06/19/1855557]]) Time magazine once nicknamed him ''*the Paul Revere of* /the environmental movement/.''
