    ([1987/01/18/0004444](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/18/magazine/clarke-work.html))
    The former, **the D. W. Griffith of** *the avant-garde*, presents
    spectacular epics or ''operas,'' the latter, an autobiographical
    monologist, sits at a card table and tells stories from his life.
4.  [Scott Joplin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q191499)
    ([1987/01/20/0005135](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/20/arts/music-bolcom-and-morris.html))
    High points of the show included the obscure Cole Porter bonbons,
    ''Two Little Babes In the Wood'' and ''Nobody's Chasing Me,'' Eubie
    Blake and Noble Sissle's ''I'm Just Wild About Harry'' (performed
    both as a waltz and as a one-step to show how a simple time change
    can alter a song's character), and piano compositions by Ernesto
    Nazareth, ''**the Scott Joplin of** *Brazil*,'' that blended ragtime
    and tango.
5.  [Rich Little](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1341644)
    ([1987/01/21/0005602](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/21/sports/super-bowl-xxi-unrushed-backups-playing-quiet-roles.html))

    Reagan fares far better, nicknamewise, than some other Presidents in
    the compendium, including one known as Gloomy Gus, King Richard,
    **the Bela Lugosi of** *American Politics*, Richard the
    Chicken-Hearted, the Nero of Our Times, the Tarnished President, the

    He is also known by less flattering terms, such as the Aging Right
    Wing Actor, the Not So Favor-ite Son and **the Errol Flynn of** *the
    B's*.
8.  [Nero](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1413)
    ([1987/01/29/0008167](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/29/us/washington-talk-briefing-by-these-names.html)) Mr.
    Reagan fares far better, nicknamewise, than some other Presidents in
    the compendium, including one known as Gloomy Gus, King Richard, the
    Bela Lugosi of American Politics, Richard the Chicken-Hearted, **the
    Nero of** *Our Times*, the Tarnished President, the Godfather, St.

    ([1987/02/08/0011525](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/08/theater/me-and-my-girl-on-disk-captures-giddy-lilt-of-show.html))
    Noel Gay was not, as some have claimed, **the Irving Berlin of**

    ([1987/02/13/0012870](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/13/arts/art-14-pictographs-from-adoph-gottlieb.html))
    Subjects like ''Flora'' and ''The Four Senses'' cause him to come on
    like **the Velvet Brueghel of** *his set*, putting his trust in
    multiplicity of subject matter and a high degree of finish.
12. [Leonardo da Vinci](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q762)
    ([1987/02/18/0014363](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/18/nyregion/amid-protest-bumpurs-case-nears-its-end.html))
    Contending that Dr. Osborne had set himself up as judge, police
    expert and hand surgeon, Mr. Smirti called him **the Leonardo da
    Vinci of** *the Bronx*.

    ([1987/02/28/0017372](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/28/sports/mets-notebook-mcreynolds-keeps-a-very-low-profile.html))
    It was enough to make people wonder if McReynolds would adjust to
    the customary passion of the Mets or become **the Greta Garbo of**
    *New York baseball*, wanting to be alone in a city and business
    where it was not easy to be alone.
14. [Mr. T](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q295107)
    ([1987/03/01/0017607](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/01/us/washngton-talk-come-the-weekend-it-s-talk-show-city.html))

    ([1987/03/01/0017800](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/01/sports/college-basketball-87-shelly-pennefather-villanova-equation-has-a-key-factor.html))
    Peretta and other observers have so much respect for Pennefather's
    varied skills that round the league she has been dubbed ''**the
    Larry Bird of** *women's basketball*.''
16. [David Merrick](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5237521)
    ([1987/03/02/0018082](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/02/theater/miserables-already-a-financial-hit.html)) Mr.
    Mackintosh's credits include ''Side by Side by Sondheim,'' ''Little
    Shop of Horrors,'' ''Cats'' and ''The Phantom of the Opera,'' and
    some colleagues call him **the David Merrick of** *today's theater*.
17. [Caligula](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1409)
    ([1987/03/08/0019639](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/08/books/baseball-s-ruling-servant.html))
    He's less well inclined toward such baseball personalities as Bill
    Veeck, who owned the Chicago White Sox during Mr. Kuhn's tenure and
    whom the commissioner considered something of a fraud (what really
    went on between the two men was a culture clash, the encounter of a
    banker and a street peddler); George Steinbrenner, the owner of the
    New York Yankees, whose antics unnerved Mr. Kuhn just as much as one
    would expect; August Busch Jr., the owner of the St. Louis
    Cardinals, whose decisions seemed dictated less by what was good for
    baseball than by how many cases of Budweiser it might sell; and
    various other owners - especially Charles O. Finley, **the Caligula
    of** *the Oakland A's* -whose codes of style and behavior
    offended Mr. Kuhn's smothering sense of decorum.
18. [Paul Revere](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q327071)
    ([1987/03/13/0021181](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/13/nyregion/our-towns-trash-from-li-sits-uneasily-in-upstate-dump.html)) Mr.
    Blake, a retired businessman, became **the Paul Revere of** *Summit
    trash*.
19. [Vivienne Westwood](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q158067)
    ([1987/03/24/0024133](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/24/style/notes-on-fashion.html))
    AT one of the first and most energetic fashion shows here last week,
    a laugh-a-minute presentation at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts by **the
    Vivienne Westwood of** *Paris*, Jean-Remy Daumas, there were the
    town's most frivolous fashion trappings: Mohican fur headpieces and
    doggy-ear hoods, heart-shaped backpacks, pillowcases reading Oui!
20. [Albert Einstein](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q937)
    ([1987/03/27/0024878](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/27/arts/restaurants-442887.html))
    If you are a fan of brains, you will no doubt get your fill with
    this enormous portion, which must come from **the Einstein of** *the
    calf world*.
21. [Clemente Susini](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2857682)
    ([1987/03/29/0025364](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/29/arts/art-view-sculpture-as-a-high-wire-performance.html))
    In her sculptures of the last eight or 10 years she has, in effect,
    been both **the Clemente Susini of** *our day* and -what is more
    difficult - the inventor of the anatomies that she puts together
    with such a dexterous hand.
22. [Richard Pryor](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q294912)
    ([1987/04/08/0028366](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/08/nyregion/new-aids-battlefield-addicts-world.html))
    So Mr. Johnson moves through Harlem, clinical and profane in equal
    measure, acting as **the Richard Pryor of** *the safe sex set*.
23. [Grace Kelly](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3925)
    ([1987/04/11/0029124](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/11/us/woman-is-to-head-editors-society.html))
    Local society columnists, much taken with her glamour and her new
    husband's social prominence, dubbed her ''**the Grace Kelly of**
    *Chicago*.''
24. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([1987/04/12/0029177](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/12/magazine/on-language.html))
    I saw myself as **the Johnny Appleseed of** *linguistics*,
    persuading hotel owners to put dictionaries in rooms everywhere,
    enabling weary travelers to look up the meanings and spellings of
    words used in late-night X-rated movies.
25. [George Steinbrenner](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q220210)
    ([1987/04/12/0029256](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/12/nyregion/waterfront-race-drawing-top-names.html))
    ''They are **the George Steinbrenner of** *marathons* because they
    go out and buy as many names as they can, regardless of what the
    athlete's current condition is.
26. [Ingrid Bergman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q43247)
    ([1987/04/19/0031974](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/19/magazine/about-men-life-with-trixie.html))
    He had called her Tiffany, which is fine for a call girl, but not
    right for **the Ingrid Bergman of** *dogs*.
27. [Duke Ellington](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4030)
    ([1987/04/22/0032772](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/22/arts/going-out-guide.html))
    He has attributed some of his stylistic inspiration to Bud Powell
    and McCoy Tyner, but his creation of salsa concerto-style
    compositions led to his being regarded by some as **the Duke
    Ellington of** *salsa*.
28. [Horatio Alger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q453251)
    ([1987/04/30/0035452](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/30/nyregion/defendant-linked-to-mob-murder-plot.html)) Mr.
    Chertoff called Mr. Massino ''**the Horatio Alger of** *the
    Mafia*.''

    ([1987/05/03/0036349](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/03/arts/home-video-documentary.html)) Mr.
    Fisher, of course, is the former chicken farmer who became **the
    Horatio Alger of** *undersea treasure hunters*.
30. [Oliver North](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q431223)
    ([1987/05/03/0036472](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/03/books/trouble-in-river-city.html))
    In the Luce tradition, Mr. Malkin can coin a phrase: the economist
    Arthur Laffer is ''**the Oliver North of** *Reaganomics*''; Milton
    Friedman is ''one of those brilliant one-idea cranks''; and
    President Reagan's alma mater is the ''providentially named Eureka
    College.''
31. [Napoleon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q517)
    ([1987/05/03/0036760](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/03/magazine/maxim-s-name-is-the-game.html))
    This steady stream of income from the exploitation of a name
    synonymous with high fashion has earned him a sobriquet, **the
    Napoleon of** *licensors*.
32. [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254)
    ([1987/05/10/0038761](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/10/arts/music-view-music-must-be-more-than-ritual.html))
    Along with the thousands of failures, a few ritualistic pieces of
    musical consequence were produced, several by **the Mozart of** *the
    idiom*, George Crumb.
33. [Robert Wilson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q541526)
    ([1987/05/10/0038816](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/10/theater/vienna-the-avant-garde-advances-earning-applause-and-ruffling-feathers.html)) Mr.
    Freyer, who is also a painter and is sometimes called **the Robert
    Wilson of** *Germany*, is best known for his stagings of Philip
    Glass's ''Satyagraha'' and ''Akhnaten'' in Stuttgart, but he has
    also directed and designed works as diverse as Mozart's
    ''Zauberflote'' for Hamburg, Weber's ''Freischutz'' for Stuttgart
    and Handel's ''Messiah'' for West Berlin.
34. [John F. Kennedy](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9696)
    ([1987/05/10/0039183](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/10/books/psychobiography-of-a-maestro.html))
    In the 60's Mr. Bernstein looked like **the John F. Kennedy of**
    *culture*.
35. [Walter Johnson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q722059)
    ([1987/05/13/0039886](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/13/sports/japan-cheers-for-star-with-staying-power.html))
    So was Masaichi Kaneda, **the Walter Johnson of** *Japan* with 400
    career victories.
36. [Neil Simon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q315808)
    ([1987/05/15/0040577](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/15/arts/satiric-1649-opera-giasone-at-mannes.html))
    Cavalli's librettist, Giacinto Andrea Cicognini, was ''**the Neil
    Simon of** *Venetian comedy*,'' Mr. Echols said.
37. [Joe DiMaggio](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q297142)
    ([1987/05/16/0040728](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/16/theater/the-stage-in-revival-wish-you-were-here.html))
    **the Joe DiMaggio of** *love*,'' he fantasizes while flexing a
    bicep that refuses to bulge
38. [Horatio Alger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q453251)
    ([1987/05/17/0041016](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/17/business/what-s-new-in-exotic-fruit-putting-a-kiwi-in-every-lunch-box.html))
    WHAT drives the marketers is the dream of finding the next kiwi,
    **the Horatio Alger of** *exotic fruit*.
39. [Bernhard Goetz](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q714892)
    ([1987/05/21/0042597](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/21/world/attack-on-the-stark-answers-to-key-questions-are-beginning-to-emerge.html))
    A former Navy official was quoted by The Baltimore Sun as saying the
    Stark's captain would have been seen as ''**the Bernhard Goetz of**
    *the Persian Gulf*.''
40. [Walter Winchell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3097952)
    ([1987/05/22/0042798](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/22/books/books-of-the-times-756887.html))
    A recent historian has described Bald as ''the Boswell of the Lost
    Generation,'' but Root disagrees: ''In my opinion '**the Walter
    Winchell of** *the Lost Generation*' would have been more like it.''
41. [Jackie Robinson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q221048)
    ([1987/05/22/0042958](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/22/business/a-black-s-climb-to-executive-suite.html))
    He added, ''In short, he is **the Jackie Robinson of** *the
    corporate world*.''
42. [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([1987/05/23/0043074](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/23/sports/sports-of-the-times-hockey-as-it-oughta-be.html))
    What would Eddie Shore, known as **the Babe Ruth of** *hockey*, have

    ([1987/05/24/0043683](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/24/nyregion/dining-out-french-and-oriental-combined.html))
    HOMER LEE is **the Woody Allen of** *Long Island restaurateurs*.
44. [George Jessel](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q506146)
    ([1987/05/27/0044042](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/27/arts/stage-political-comedy.html))
    Compared to the younger smoothies, Mr. Altman, who called himself
    ''**the George Jessel of** *intellectuals*,'' addressed the audience
    from the standpoint of an embattled, aging hipster commenting
    amusingly on everything from the relationship between food and
    language to condom advertising.
45. [George Will](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1270178)
    ([1987/05/27/0044071](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/27/us/washington-talk-press-corps-japanese-gain-perspective-covering-america.html))
    Some go back to Japan to become celebrities; for example, after six
    years in Washington, Yoshihisa Komori is now considered **the George
    Will of** *newspaper columnists in Japan*.
46. [John Henry](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2596171)
    ([1987/06/10/0048033](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/10/sports/scouting-lucky-horseshoe.html))
    ''He's a horse who's had serious physical problems,'' said Dr. Lee,
    who treats human patients - including athletes from horse racing,
    basketball, football and boxing - at his office in South
    Orange, N.J. ''I call him **the John Henry of** *the trotting set*.
47. [Dan Rather](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q733027)
    ([1987/06/18/0049974](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/18/us/dairy-queens-fill-big-void-in-small-town-texas.html))
    She might be called **the Dan Rather of** *Shackelford County*,
    receiving and transmitting news and gossip with incredible speed
    and efficiency.
48. [Henry Miller](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q187765)
    ([1987/06/21/0050669](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/21/books/something-rotten-in-norway.html))
    Judging by the author's systematic peppering of his brief plot with
    gamey episodes of sexual improvisation, and by the hero's awesome
    arousability (a fleeting memory, an unseemly word, and he is in the
    manly state), one might think Mr. Faldbakken aspires to become **the
    Henry Miller of** *Norway*.
49. [Liberace](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q347528)
    ([1987/06/26/0052031](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/26/arts/herbie-hancock-trio.html))
    With a lot of flashy filigree and little swing or melodic
    inventiveness, Mr. Jordan threatens to become **the Liberace of**
    *guitar*.
50. [Abner Doubleday](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q322555)
    ([1987/06/28/0052404](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/28/nyregion/long-island-journal-170187.html))
    ''I wrote them,'' said Mr. Perrone, **the Abner Doubleday of** *Play
    Ball*.
51. [Frank Sinatra](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40912)
    ([1987/06/29/0052991](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/29/nyregion/japan-s-sinatra-sings-for-fans-in-new-york.html))
    The women had traveled 12,000 miles, all the way from Tokyo, and
    when they arrived in Manhattan yesterday, they had one man's name on

    Andris Liepa, the son of Maris Liepa, is an exciting classical
    dancer with a very contemporary veneer, **the Patrick Dupond of**
    *Moscow* but with a poetic edge.
54. [Frank Sinatra](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40912)
    ([1987/07/05/0054412](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/05/weekinreview/headliners-heartthrob.html)) Mr.
    Itsuki, who is known as **the Frank Sinatra of** *Japan*, was
    trailed by 180 of his most devoted Japanese fans, mostly unmarried
    middle-aged women, who paid \$5,500 each to make the trip.

    ([1987/08/23/0068396](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/23/movies/film-john-sayles-mines-the-coal-wars.html))
    Sort of **the Woody Allen of** *Hoboken*, Mr. Sayles uses many of
    his regulars -Maggie Renzi, David Strathairn, Josh Mostel, Nancy
    Mette - in ''Matewan,'' but he also makes maximum advantage of a
    deep-voiced newcomer named James Earl Jones, who does his best not
    to dominate the screen as the natural leader of the black miners.
59. [Pete Rose](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q739866)
    ([1987/08/23/0068626](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/23/nyregion/reluctant-candidate-headed-for-congress.html))
    ''Shays is **the Pete Rose of** *the Connecticut Republican Party*,
    hustle, hustle, hustle,'' said Robert S. Poliner, the Connecticut
    Republican state chairman, who called the win ''a tremendous shot in

    nationally'' for the party.

    It came from an unlikely source - Anker Jorgensen, an earnest but

    politics*.
63. [Joseph Goebbels](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41749)

    school of crime reporting; and a third, the novelist Michael
    Mewshaw, who, in ''Money to Burn,'' is so bent on making Steven
    Benson **the Alfred Dreyfus of** *southwest Florida* that he
    inflates what could have been a chapter of sharp-eyed criticism into
    a book-length orgy of nit-picking.
66. [Alice Cooper](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q332032)
    ([1987/09/16/0074975](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/16/nyregion/about-new-york-a-rock-wizard-hopes-glasnost-means-mr-ed.html))

    Brandon, the 37-year-old founder of Cheerleader Productions, can be
    thought of as **the Roone Arledge of** *Britain*.
68. [Ray Kroc](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q319648)
    ([1987/09/20/0075758](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/20/business/the-big-mac-of-adult-education.html))
    THE vision that Mr. Zanker's energy serves is as simple as it is
    grandiose: He would like to be **the Ray Kroc of** *adult
    education*.
69. [Elvis Presley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q303)

    If he is not exactly **the Elvis Presley of** *ballet*, Mr.
    Baryshnikov demonstrates a popular appeal that reaches far beyond
    the usual ballet audience.
70. [John Alden](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6218491)

    ''He was **the Ozzie Smith of** *the West Indies*,'' the spectator
    said, referring to the St. Louis Cardinals' shortstop who is a
    premier fielder.
72. [Jimi Hendrix](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5928)
    ([1987/09/25/0077266](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/25/arts/pop-and-jazz-guide-362887.html))
    For Roger Miller, it's as much an electronic instrument as the
    electric guitar - and he's set out to become **the Jimi Hendrix of**
    *the electric piano*.

    didn't always serve his best purposes.

    ([1987/09/27/0077726](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/27/books/science-technology-who-ordered-the-muon.html))
    But the tide eventually shifted, partly because the supreme
    materialist of physics, Richard Feynman of the California Institute
    of Technology, a man once described as **the Groucho Marx of**
    *physics*, turned the quest for nuclear substructure into a
    cause celebre.
76. [Ansel Adams](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60809)

    So while Marshall W. Mason commenced a long leave of absence from
    New York's Circle Repertory Company (he resigned last year), and
    Gordon Davidson did the same from the Mark Taper Forum in Los
    Angeles, Mr. Hall, at 55, began doing double duty, announcing with
    typical bravado that he planned to be ''**the Lenny Bernstein of**
    *the theater world*.''
79. [Julia Child](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q214477)
    ([1987/11/11/0091723](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/11/garden/from-one-cookbook-an-expert-chef-was-made.html))
    A letter to Ruth Sirkis - ''**the Julia Child of** *Israel*,''
    according to Ms. Levy - led to a two-year stint as her assistant.

    I don't think it is going too far to call Mr. Scanlon ''**the James
    Watt of** *consumer protection*.''

    ([1987/11/20/0094729](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/20/nyregion/a-reporter-brings-glasnost-to-connecticut.html))

    If, as the author tells us, the deal is an art form, then the book

    excited word of mouth since early work-in-progress performances

    or did not think of the words of his friend, the distinguished Y. Y.
    Trunk, **the Matthew Arnold of** *Yiddish letters*, who warned in
    November 1948, ''You do not suppose that Jews and Jewish values will
    be saved if Israel becomes a puppy hound among big hounds.''

    ([1988/03/13/0127169](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/13/nyregion/long-island-journal-501988.html))
    ''Don Ryan is a terrific guy, a dedicated guy, **the Dean Smith of**
    *biddy basketball*,'' said Steve Nisenson of Jericho, the father of
    a 12-year-old player, Brett, who at an estimated height of four and
    a half feet is the shortest player on the biddy team.

    ([1988/03/27/0130877](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/27/magazine/how-magnates-pick-partners.html))
    AT 65, JAY PRITZKER is **the Louis XIV of** *the deal makers*, the
    Sun King whose ever-expanding family empire includes the Hyatt hotel
    chain; Braniff airlines; the Marmon Group, a \$3-billion assemblage
    of more than 60 industrial companies, and diversified interests in
    real estate, financial services and timberland.

    ''I suppose I'm kind of **the Helen Thomas of** *the New York
    reporters*,'' he said, referring to United Press International's
    longtime White House correspondent, who always gets the first
    question at President Reagan's news conferences.
21. [Howard Hughes](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q189081)
    ([1988/03/29/0131517](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/29/us/milwaukee-mayor-outlives-problems-and-politicians-in-his-28-year-reign.html))
    One alderman has derided him as ''**the Howard Hughes of** *City
    Hall*,'' a reference to what some think is a reclusive style
    of governing.
22. [Kenny Scharf](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3195237)
    ([1988/04/01/0132316](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/01/arts/art-that-strikes-up-conversations-with-viewers.html))
    These objects radiate a physical perfection, good humor and, despite
    their effusive hardware, a buoyancy that is reminiscent of the best
    graffiti art, so it is fitting that people are calling Mr. Bickerton
    ''**the Kenny Scharf of** *Neo-Geo*.''
23. [René Descartes](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9191)
    ([1988/04/08/0134160](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/08/arts/review-art-urban-and-rural-vistas-from-jane-freilicher.html))

    Eugene Borowitz, professor of Jewish religious thought at Hebrew
    Union College, called Rabbi Steinsaltz ''**the Rashi of** *our

    for centuries of Jewish readers.''
26. [Bill Bradley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q504025)

    Under Mr. Rawls, who is described by some staff members as ''**the
    Oscar Wilde of** *profanity*'' because of his newsroom outbursts,
    the news staff was pushed to be faster in pursuit of news and
    more aggressive.

    From the English sailor Blackthorne washed up on the beach of
    17th-century Japan in ''Shogun'' to the amnesia victim Jason Bourne
    washed up on the beach in the south of France in 1988 in ''The
    Bourne Identity,'' Richard Chamberlain has become **the Robert
    Redford of** *the living room*, finding a stardom in prime time that
    has eluded him on the silver screen.
34. [Billy Martin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q508574)

    Buchanan comes across as ''**the Thomas Paine of** *the Right*,''
    and Adm. John M. Poindexter as a ''sphinx-like'' stonewaller, who
    knew ''something bad was going on'' but didn't want to investigate.

    mole of them all, who betrayed British secrets to the K.G.B.

    ([1988/06/05/0151262](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/05/us/powered-by-sun-young-racers-look-to-future.html))
    Twenty-one-year-old Mr. Worden, the leader of the M.I.T. team, is

    Though he was condemned by some as a porn king, praised by others as
    ''**the Lenin of** *the sexual revolution*,'' the fact remains that
    Maurice Girodias was courageous enough to publish William Burroughs,
    Samuel Beckett, Jean Genet, J. P. Donleavy, Nikos Kazantzakis and
    Nabokov's ''Lolita'' when others were too afraid of censorship
    to try.
42. [Lon Chaney](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q312656)
    ([1988/06/15/0153997](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/15/opinion/observer-the-ivy-hayseed.html))
    The notion has evidently got into his head that these high-class
    markings will harm him with the voters, for he seems intent on
    becoming **the Lon Chaney of** *politics*, the Man of a
    Thousand Faces.
43. [Connie Mack](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1126349)
    ([1988/06/24/0156226](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/24/sports/in-the-corners-a-kid-vs-the-old-man.html))
    By contrast, Futch, 76, is a mellow type who speaks slowly and
    softly and carries himself more like an elder statesman, **the
    Connie Mack of** *the fight game*.

    ([1988/07/17/0162061](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/17/travel/a-gainsborough-landscape.html))
    Gainsborough is **the Mozart of** *portraiture*.
48. [Norman Rockwell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q271884)
    ([1988/07/22/0163681](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/22/us/the-democrats-in-atlanta-convention-chronicle-on-last-day-party-starts-to-poop.html)) Mr.
    Paul, a 60-year-old Friar Tuck lookalike, is considered **the Norman
    Rockwell of** *television directors*.
49. [Marco Polo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6101)
    ([1988/07/26/0164793](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/26/us/marco-polo-of-drug-traffic-among-22-indicted.html))
    Marks was **the Marco Polo of** *the drug traffic*,'' said Thomas V.
    Cash, special agent in charge of the Miami Division of the Drug
    Enforcement Administration.
50. [Samuel Beckett](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37327)
    ([1988/07/31/0166391](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/31/books/bleak-visions-hand-clapping-lessons.html))
    He is a master of erasures and negations, a visionary of discomfort
    and reproof, **the Samuel Beckett of** *postwar American poetry*.
51. [Pat Boone](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q342778)
    ([1988/08/04/0167715](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/04/arts/review-pop-rhythm-in-a-suit-and-tie.html))
    If not for his experimental streak, Robert Palmer could be **the Pat
    Boone of** *the 1980's*.
52. [James Naismith](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q188962)
    ([1988/08/08/0168974](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/08/sports/sports-world-specials-hoover-s-legacy.html))
    That's because **the James Naismith of** *Hoover-ball* was the White
    House physician, Vice Admiral Joel T. Boone, who devised the game as
    a way to entice Hoover, who was notoriously lackadaisical about his
    health, into exercising.
53. [Wallis Simpson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q209417)
    ([1988/08/11/0169750](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/11/sports/the-gretzky-trade-two-sides-in-edmonton-future-is-on-hold.html))
    And Janet Jones, the beautiful bride in what was built up as a royal
    wedding here July 16, was seen as **the Wallis Simpson of** *her
    time*, the wife who coerced her husband into leaving.
54. [Charles Ives](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q309648)
    ([1988/08/12/0170106](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/12/obituaries/giacinto-scelsi-composer-83.html)) Mr.
    Scelsi, who was widely called **the Charles Ives of** *Italy*, was
    known for his choral and symphonic works.
55. [Mother Teresa](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30547)
    ([1988/08/14/0170859](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/14/sports/cities-stadiums-and-responsibility.html))
    That willingness doesn't make him **the Mother Teresa of** *his
    time*, but it does make him a responsible businessman, a rare enough
    species in baseball.
56. [Lou Gehrig](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q357444)
    ([1988/08/17/0171750](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/17/sports/sports-of-the-times-king-richard-in-heavy-traffic-in-new-york.html))
    The man who has won seven Daytonas and a total of 200 races -
    although none, Gary Carter, since July 4, 1984, which was 118 races
    ago - is already **the Lou Gehrig of** *racing*, about to start his
    500th straight race at Brooklyn International Speedway in Michigan
    on Sunday.
57. [Napoleon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q517)
    ([1988/08/21/0172829](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/21/books/take-me-out-to-the-metagame.html))
    They were a completely different breed whose first confrontation
    with the North was not at Fort Sumter, but 38 years earlier, when a
    North Carolina colonel, known as ''**the Napoleon of** *the turf*,''
    encouraged any and all Yankees to race their horses against the
    indomitable Sir Henry - for a stake of \$20,000.
58. [Marilyn Monroe](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4616)
    ([1988/08/28/0174823](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/28/business/the-martial-arts-as-moneymakers.html))
    ''He's **the Marilyn Monroe of** *this industry*,'' said Bill Groak,
    editor of M.A.
59. [William Shakespeare](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q692)
    ([1988/08/28/0174916](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/28/arts/dance-view-sir-frederick-ashton-poetic-innovator.html))
    Sir Frederick Ashton was **the Shakespeare of** *ballet* - not the
    Shakespeare who wrote revenge tragedies but the poet who composed
    love sonnets.
60. [Antonio Stradivari](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q182011)
    ([1988/09/04/0176939](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/04/nyregion/shop-owner-returns-bassoon.html))
    It was made by W. Heckel, a German company that Mr. Segal described
    as ''**the Stradivarius of** *woodwind manufacturing*.''
61. [Barbara Walters](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q231417)
    ([1988/09/11/0178347](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/11/nyregion/children-of-flatbush-adjust-to-palm-trees-and-poi.html))
    ''The tenor of this club is to denigrate, to humiliate,'' explains
    Freda Reeser, a member who calls herself ''**the Barbara Walters
    of** *the Hawaiian Jewish community*'' because she interviews
    visiting celebrities for a local magazine.
62. [Wayne Gretzky](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q209518)
    ([1988/09/11/0178517](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/11/sports/the-seoul-olympics-the-games-from-archery-to-yachting-cycling.html))
    No such distinction is made for women, and so Jeannie Longo of
    France, **the Wayne Gretzky of** *women's cycling*, will compete in
    the Games, as a heavy favorite.
63. [John F. Kennedy](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9696)
    ([1988/09/25/0182307](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/25/world/for-canadian-liberals-a-crisis-in-leadership.html))
    All told, the four years since he quit his corporate directorships
    on Bay Street to succeed Mr. Trudeau as Liberal leader have been
    shocking ones for Mr. Turner, whose supporters once hailed him as
    **the John F. Kennedy of** *Canadian politics*.
64. [Steve Jobs](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q19837)
    ([1988/09/28/0183345](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/28/business/pc-powerhouse-made-in-taiwan.html))
    That Acer has come this far is something of a testament to the drive
    and unconventional approach of the 43-year-old Mr. Shih, who has
    become **the Steve Jobs of** *Taiwan*.
65. [P. T. Barnum](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766)
    ([1988/10/05/0185168](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/05/garden/points-west-poor-seoul-los-angeles-says-smugly.html))
    That was never more evident than at the opening ceremonies of our
    Olympics, staged by the longtime Hollywood producer David Wolper,
    **the P. T. Barnum of** *patriotism*.
66. [Muhammad Ali](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36107)
    ([1988/10/09/0186323](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/09/magazine/the-hard-ride-of-willy-t.html))
    Until recently, the muscular, middleweight Ribbs, whom the racing
    press once labeled **the Muhammad Ali of** *auto racing*, might have
    reacted to such an incident by punching Pruett out in the
    pits afterward.
67. [Andrew Lloyd Webber](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q180975)
    ([1988/10/10/0186766](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/10/business/next-inc-produces-a-gala-and-also-a-new-computer.html))
    But more stems from Mr. Jobs's reputation as **the Andrew Lloyd
    Webber of** *product introductions*, a master of stage flair and
    special effects.
68. [Honoré de Balzac](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9711)
    ([1988/10/14/0187729](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/14/books/from-balzac-of-egypt-energy-and-nuance.html))
    Critics sometimes call Naguib Mahfouz **the Balzac of** *Egypt*
    because of the way his works express the pulsating energy of city
    life and because of their psychologically nuanced characters and
    broad social concern.
69. [Henny Youngman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2586583)
    ([1988/10/14/0187903](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/14/us/campaign-trail-forget-uncle-milty-it-s-the-new-dukakis.html))
    The new revised Democratic Presidential candidate is exuding
    dazzling one-liners - **the Henny Youngman of** *American politics*.
70. [Bob Hope](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q94081)

    Comedy is Mr. Yoshida's specialty (''I was once called '**the Bob
    Hope of** *Bunraku*' ''), and he has adapted a lot from Chaplin
    and Keaton.
71. [P. T. Barnum](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766)
    ([1988/10/17/0188726](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/17/sports/sports-world-specials-one-of-a-kind.html))
    It came from Joshua Evans, the hoopla-minded young proprietor of
    Lelands auction house in Allentown, Pa., who has emerged as **the P.
    T. Barnum of** *baseball cards*.
72. [Andy Warhol](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5603)
    ([1988/10/23/0190647](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/23/arts/music-view-clothes-don-t-make-the-opera.html))
    He is **the Andy Warhol of** *opera production*, screaming at us to
    look at sleazy banality with tolerant eyes and recognize it as a
    new profundity.
73. [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([1988/11/04/0194523](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/04/sports/sports-of-the-times-how-to-improve-hockey.html))
    After all, who could ever again even challenge the 978 stitches
    (his count) earned by Eddie Shore, **the Babe Ruth of** *hockey*,
    during his 14-year N.H.L.
74. [Lorin Maazel](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q117710)

    As we have learned through his appearances at the New York City
    Opera, Mr. Siciliani is something like **the Lorin Maazel of**
    *Italian opera conductors*.
75. [Leo Tolstoy](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7243)
    ([1988/11/13/0197859](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/13/books/the-notorious-unknown-indian.html))
    Although Mr. Chaudhuri may not be what Saul Bellow would call **the
    Tolstoy of** *the Bengalis*, he may remind many readers of
    Nabokov's Pnin.
76. [Rod Laver](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q105550)
    ([1988/12/04/0203718](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/04/magazine/serving-on-dad-s-court.html))

    his home court.
77. [Samuel Beckett](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37327)
    ([1988/12/04/0203748](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/04/books/christmas-books-notable-books-of-the-year.html))
    a master of erasures and negations, a visionary of discomfort and
    reproof, **the Samuel Beckett of** *postwar American poetry*.''

    ([1988/12/06/0204254](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/06/theater/review-theater-who-was-that-chicken.html))
    As a result, he is regarded as ''the Stalin of Patchogue, **the Idi
    Amin of** *Long Island*,'' which, along with many other aspects of
    the play, is a considerable overstatement.
79. [Joseph Stalin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q855)
    ([1988/12/06/0204254](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/06/theater/review-theater-who-was-that-chicken.html))
    As a result, he is regarded as ''**the Stalin of** *Patchogue*, the
    Idi Amin of Long Island,'' which, along with many other aspects of
    the play, is a considerable overstatement.

    ([1988/12/12/0206044](https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/12/us/washington-talk-briefing-world-we-are-here.html))
    The next time troubles threaten in the Philippines or Pakistan and
    the urge to help is strong, you can suit up and say ''Lafayette, we
    are here'' in Manila or Islamabad and stand a chance of being
    welcome, says Representative Stephen Solarz, Democrat of New York,
    At a lunch in Mr. Solarz' honor last year, President Corazon Aquino
    thanked him for his work on the House Foreign Affairs Committee on
    behalf of the ''Filipino struggle for freedom'' and addressed him as
    ''**the Lafayette of** *the Philippine revolution*.''

    ([1989/01/08/0212236](http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/08/education/in-search-of-popular-culture.html))
    ''That gets me back to legitimacy,'' Mr. Coogan explained, but his
    eyes lighted up when he added, ''I can be **the Samuel Johnson of**
    *comic books*: They are really just another form of literature.''
2.  [Attila](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36724)
    ([1989/01/11/0213159](http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/11/opinion/observer-what-a-jim-dandy-ending.html))
    The reporters were reporting Bush nicenesses that would have been
    unthinkable a few weeks ago when this very same George Bush was
    **the Attila of** *the campaign trail*.
3.  [Howard Hughes](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q189081)
    ([1989/01/15/0214315](http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/15/arts/a-living-definition-of-acting.html))
    Ray McAnally is a bluff, robust fellow, most certainly not to be
    regarded as **the Howard Hughes of** *Irish theaterland*.
4.  [Lillian Hellman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q233701)
    ([1989/01/15/0214451](http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/15/books/l-famous-for-15-minutes-947289.html))
    Having read every word of Isabelle's book, I can only surmise either
    that she wishes to be immortalized as **the Lillian Hellman of**
    *the art world* or that the men with whom I spent every waking hour
    had, previous to our first meeting, collectively repented, reformed
    and miraculously transformed their characters without the benefit of
    any self-help programs.
5.  [Clint Eastwood](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q43203)
    ([1989/01/16/0214485](http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/16/theater/review-theater-macho-memories.html)) Mr.
    O'Keefe, a playwright and actor whose surreal family drama ''All
    Night Long'' was produced in 1984 in New York at Second Stage, might
    be described as **the Clint Eastwood of** *performance artists*.

    ''The obvious conclusion is that unless we're careful, **the Buck
    Rogers of** *the 1990's* is going to be living in Seoul, Korea,
    instead of Chattanooga or Chicago,'' said Lamar Alexander, president

    Citi will be the world's first truly global financial institution,

    Now it is Mr. Penderecki who is seen as having regressed into
    neo-Romantic recycling, Mr. Schnittke is prized as a, if not the,
    leading Soviet composer, and Shostakovich is **the Mahler of** *the
    80's*.
13. [Antonio Stradivari](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q182011)
    ([1989/02/10/0221928](https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/10/arts/review-art-remington-s-war-and-old-west.html))
    Not only do we believe in that smooth and silent progress, but we
    recognize the canoe itself as one built by Remington's friend, J.
    Henry Rushton, still spoken of as **the Stradivarius of** *canoe
    builders*.
14. [Oliver North](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q431223)

    And so we see his son, Reginald Jones, once again in pursuit of an
    absolute (this time justice), enlist in the Civil War in Spain and
    then again in the Second World War, where his experiences repeat,
    with little profit, those of his father; when demobilized, he is
    caught up in the Welsh nationalist cause, **the Groucho Marx of**
    *wars*, and while he is at it he discovers and rescues Excalibur
    from the Hermitage in Russia.

    wasn't **the Mike Tyson of** *vintage*,'' the champion said
    afterward -Tyson didn't feel any lack of conviction about
    his potency.

    He called Mr. Anthony ''**the P. T. Barnum of** *sleaze*'' and said
    the accusations were a ''pre-emptive strike'' in advance of the
    ethics committee's report on Mr. Wright.

    Who could protest a project designed by children, hand-built by
    parents, paid for with private money and planned by Robert Leathers,
    **the Frank Lloyd Wright of** *the Sesame Street set*?

    Alexander W. Doniphan, at six and a half feet tall a giant in his

    He writes that Marshall later invited him to be his collaborator,
    but that he turned him down, having concluded that Marshall was

    their dust-bowl heritage.
33. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)

    ([1989/06/06/0256423](http://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/06/arts/a-showplace-for-a-showman.html))
    The top-hatted statue will utter not a word about the American
    sucker, for the simple reason that Barnum - **the Michelangelo of**
    *buncombe, hokum, hoopla and ballyhoo* - was himself the victim of
    a hoax.
40. [Adolf Hitler](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q352)

    ([1989/06/11/0257800](https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/11/books/travel-books.html))
    The most Anglicized exercise may be IN TROUBLE AGAIN: A Journey
    Between the Orinoco and the Amazon (272 pp., Atlantic, \$17.95),
    Redmond O'Hanlon's search for human or animal horrors between the
    Amazon and the Orinoco rivers, which serves to cement the

    day.''

    ''Although Mr. Chaudhuri may not be what Saul Bellow would call

    Nabokov's Pnin,'' our reviewer, David Lelyveld, said in 1988.
6.  [Mike Wallace](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q325487)

    It has often been remarked that the youthful-looking Clive Barker
    resembles the youthful-looking Paul McCartney; I'd go a step farther
    and say that Clive Barker is **the Paul McCartney of** *horror
    fiction* - like the Cute Beatle, Mr. Barker creates popular art that
    is superficially cheerful yet melancholy, if not profoundly
    pessimistic, at bottom.

    On both sides of the apartheid struggle, there are people wondering
    whether Mr. de Klerk will turn out to be **the Gorbachev of** *South
    Africa*, a reformer who sets out on a modest course of change only
    to find that he uncages forces that ripple through society in
    unpredictable ways, forces that even threaten to overwhelm him.
13. [Bella Abzug](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q464724)

    For several years now, Leo Durocher, who in some ways was both the

    ''Howard Finster: Man of Visions'' is a good straightforward report
    on the career of Mr. Finster, a Southern backwoods preacher, now in
    his 70's, who has been called **the Picasso of** *folk art*.
16. [Wayne Gretzky](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q209518)
    ([1990/03/02/0331029](http://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/02/sports/no-rough-stuff-allowed.html))

    That achievement makes him a significant contributor to American
    mass culture, every bit as much as the 68-week winning streak makes
    him **the Joe DiMaggio of** *the Nielsen game*.
20. [Richard Nixon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9588)

    But his insistence on replacing strikers with nonunion drivers, and
    retaining them after the strike, has made him **the Frank Lorenzo
    of** *the highways* in the eyes of Greyhound drivers, and raised the

    Before Mr. Dinkins selected him, Mr. Schafffer said he dreamed that

    Today's sport for **the George Plimpton of** *the political world*

    A great many of our classic tales of travel and adventure (as
    bookstores customarily combine them) are ventures into the interior,
    explorations of the landscape of the self, even while they are
    advertised as treks across Antarctica or Arabia, assaults on snowy
    unreachable peaks, cockroachy crawls into the cracks of the earth,
    voyages alone around the world or those hunts that test **the
    Hemingway of** *the heart* - to mention some of our more
    popular ordeals.

    The article on April 22 \[''Elmont Seamstress Is **the Betsy Ross
    of** *Horse Racing*''\] tells us that Antoinette Brocklebank sews 25
    percent of the silks at Belmont, so it's 4 to 1 that the winning
    jockey will wear her outfit.

    Left-handed all the way, standing 6 feet 2 inches and weighing about

    Since pattern was what determined style, she was in a sense **the
    Coco Chanel of** *her time*, though her name is curiously absent
    from contemporary correspondence and diaries.
70. [Spike Jones](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q622636)

    Interested in ceremonial objects, the artist began applying to them
    Modernist principles and by the early 1930's was well on the way to
    becoming **the Mies van der Rohe of** *the genre*, particularly with
    respect to Hebrew calligraphy but not to the point of Bauhaus
    ''baldness.''
75. [Joseph Stalin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q855)

    But I have seen even greater perversities, if only on the movies or
    on TV; I saw Hitler waving in a friendly manner to fanaticized
    little girls of the Hitlerjugend; I saw mass murderer Stalin kissing
    a child with the red Communist youth organization scarf, a child
    whose parents ended up like so many in Gulag camps; I saw Gottwald,
    **the Stalin of** *Czechoslovakia*, smilingly joking with young
    miners, the builders of socialism and soon to be cripples; I saw the
    Iraqi president Hussein patting the children of his hostages whom -
    as he now says - he is ready to have shot.

    Having spent a good part of the last year and a quarter at the task
    of reading for an annual best-story collection, I've begun to feel
    like **the Professor Irwin Corey of** *the short story* - the
    world's greatest living authority over a discipline that doesn't
    exactly exist, a professorship of nothing, tenured in the university
    without walls.
79. [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([1990/10/28/0396229](http://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/28/books/books-business-doing-good-well.html))

    ([1990/10/31/0396993](http://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/31/sports/sports-of-the-times-new-history-being-made-at-virginia.html))
    But teammates they are: Dooley, a fifth-year receiver, too slow and
    too small to be recruited, and Kirby, a sophomore running back who
    would only attend a school that would allow him to be **the Bo
    Jackson of** *autumn and winter*.
81. [Leonard Bernstein](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q152505)
    ([1990/11/04/0397821](http://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/04/arts/classical-view-america-still-shuns-americans.html))

    And that was when Charles Oakley, **the Charles Atlas of**
    *forwards*, was about to attempt a jump shot.
83. [Liberace](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q347528)
    ([1990/11/11/0399880](http://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/11/arts/dance-view-divining-the-mystique-of-mark-morris.html))

    ([1990/11/11/0399939](http://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/11/magazine/days-and-nights-in-baghdad.html))

    ([1990/11/13/0400456](http://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/13/business/dow-soars-cut-by-fed-is-expected.html))

    Nevertheless, Mr. Reagan was signed up and became "**the Errol Flynn
    of** *the B pictures*," eventually making a couple of A films as
    well: "Knute Rockne -- All American," in which he played the dying
    Gipper, and "Kings Row," in which he played a young man who loses
    his legs.
87. [Joan Baez](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131725)
    ([1990/11/25/0403716](http://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/25/nyregion/the-guide-201990.html))

    "Buried in Blue," which ends the second act, is one of several
    numbers in the show in which the band is joined by strings, arranged
    and conducted by Marc Shaiman, the gifted young arranger and
    composer who is becoming **the Nelson Riddle of** *his generation*.
89. [Thomas Edison](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8743)
    ([1990/11/29/0404840](http://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/29/nyregion/what-a-stroke-of-um-ingenuity-anyhow.html))
    He promised a three-day showcase of the newest and neatest
    brainstorms, a chance for inventors to rub elbows with other
    inventors -- including, of course, the man who bills himself as
    **the Thomas Edison of** *Japan*, a man who even invented his
    own name.
90. [Walt Whitman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81438)
    ([1990/12/02/0405597](http://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/02/books/architecture.html))
    Louis Sullivan was **the Walt Whitman of** *American architecture*,

    ([1990/12/02/0405643](http://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/02/travel/operatic-memorabilia-at-la-scala.html))
    The souvenirs of Mascagni's opera "Nero" are 10 times as interesting
    if we remember that the year of the performance in question was 1934
    -- a time at which Mussolini was shaping up to become **the Nero
    of** *his day*.
92. [Tennessee Williams](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q134262)
    ([1990/12/20/0409721](http://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/20/business/the-media-business-advertising-an-offbeat-campaign-for-dutch-cheese.html))

    He'd be considered **the Columbus of** *the art world*, only he
    wasn't even nearly the first European to claim others' cultures.
94. [David Lynch](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2071)
    ([1990/12/23/0410588](http://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/23/arts/review-music-beethoven-concerto-in-context-of-its-time.html))
    That meant, on Wednesday, eager introductory remarks by Mr. Kapilow
    that largely duplicated his own program notes, some silly
    overstatements ("Beethoven, **the David Lynch of** *his times*.

    The reason Colorado is playing Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl is
    because Notre Dame (**the Bear Bryant of** *the times*), and not the
    Orange Bowl Committee, insisted a decision be made two weeks before
    pick-'em day.

    Bernie," "Can't Take You Nowhere" and "I'm Hip," to name several of
    the roughly 100 songs he's written, Mr. Frishberg might be described

    Vanilla Ice has been called **the Elvis Presley of** *rap*, but
    that's an insult to Presley, who transformed the blues and country
    music he drew on.

    In the time it takes to drink one cup of coffee, Ruth reminds Ellen
    of how "immensely capable" she is, pushes her to pursue her dream

    The early compositions that established his credentials as **the
    Napoleon of** *the avant-garde*, like "Le Marteau Sans Maitre" and
    "Le Visage Nuptial," caught attention for their Serial rigidity and
    the novel severity of their sonorities.

    He was **the Cardinal Richelieu of** *10 Downing Street*, a civil

    ([1991/07/11/0458936](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/11/garden/the-man-who-put-steam-in-your-iron.html))
    Many consider him **the Frank Lloyd Wright of** *industrial design*,
    not surprising since both men were born and raised in Wisconsin and
    did perhaps their most important work in the Middle West.
44. [Ken Russell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q55249)
    ([1991/07/12/0459273](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/12/arts/review-dance-the-royal-ballet-recalls-its-past.html))
    There are times when Mr. MacMillan can be mistaken for **the Ken

    ([1991/07/13/0459422](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/13/opinion/public-private-summer-reading-lists.html))
    Tina Brown, who is **the P. T. Barnum of** *the magazine world*,
    obviously knows all this, even though she is originally from
    England, a country where journalism is not seasonal but schizoid,
    veering wildly between high dudgeon and women in thong swimsuits.
46. [Henry Kissinger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q66107)
    ([1991/07/14/0459865](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/14/business/making-a-difference-digital-diplomat.html)) Mr.

    In that history, Modell has been called **the George Steinbrenner
    of** *the Midwest*, another owner who meddles too much and hurts his
    team, and in the same breath he is praised as a man who provides the
    N.F.L., as it gears for the 90's and beyond, with continuity, a
    sense of history, intense loyalty and, judiciously, service.
50. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)

    ([1991/08/09/0465813](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/09/sports/robert-lipsyte-give-me-that-old-time-religion.html))
    Saving the image of the game -- he fired Dave Pallone basically for
    being gay -- was his job, but as a man who saw himself as **the
    Socrates of** *sport*, that public-relations function would have
    eventually rubbed up against his higher conceits.
53. [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([1991/08/11/0466280](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/11/news/camera.html))
    Soon, Americans could immediately recognize an Eisenstaedt picture,
    and several generations of photographers, amateurs and professionals
    alike, tried to emulate their hero, **the Babe Ruth of**
    *35-millimeter photography*.
54. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1991/08/11/0466343](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/11/sports/sports-of-the-times-rooting-to-stay-clean.html))
    On a recent evening on the Upper West Side, Earl Manigault recalled
    the days when he was **the Michael Jordan of** *Harlem*, a man who
    jumped so high he once believed he could take off after a running
    start and end up sitting on the rim.
55. [Don Nelson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q375600)
    ([1991/08/14/0466892](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/14/sports/basketball-agent-makes-capital-for-an-elite-clientele.html))

    In The National Review, on the other hand, Jim Atkinson, referring
    to the comedienne as "**the Hulk Hogan of** *feminism*," perceives
    her as "a cunning marketeer who has figured out how to parlay a form
    of vulgar reverse sexism into stardom."
57. [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254)
    ([1991/08/20/0468225](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/20/arts/review-music-is-mendelssohn-a-heavyweight-festival-puts-him-on-the-scales.html))
    Here was one of the great musical prodigies, a man who by the age of
    18 had composed major works for the chamber and orchestral
    repertory, who was responsible for the revival of interest in Bach
    in the 19th century, who was the acknowledged leader of German
    musical life before his death at 38 in 1847, a composer Schumann
    called **the Mozart of** *the 19th century*.
58. [David Souter](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q472547)
    ([1991/08/22/0468513](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/22/nyregion/news-summary-635791.html))
    The nominee for health chief of New York State, Dr. Mark Chassin, is
    emerging as **the David Souter of** *gubernatorial appointees*, a
    man with little public record on major health issues and little
    freedom to stake out his positions.
59. [Henny Youngman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2586583)

    As a Caucasian who has seen just about every Charlie Chan movie
    there is, I must respond to the article by Gish Jen about
    stereotypes that perpetuate Charlie Chan as **the Stepin Fetchit
    of** *Orientals* \[ "Challenging the Asian Illusion," Aug. 11 \] .

    What about news reports that Biosphere 2 is basically a survivalist
    cult built around the magnetic personality of John Allen, whom The
    Village Voice characterized as "much more the Jim Jones than **the
    Johnny Appleseed of** *the ecology movement*?"
63. [Robert Redford](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q59215)
    ([1991/09/27/0476549](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/27/theater/on-stage-and-off.html))
    Macaulay Culkin, the 10-year-old star of "Home Alone" and **the
    Robert Redford of** *the kindergarten set*, can be seen in the flesh
    at Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52d Street, on Oct. 9 and 10
    for the opening of its annual Octoberfest.

    ([1991/09/29/0476983](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/29/travel/comics-characters-beloved-by-brussels.html))
    A 1929 first edition of "Tintin au Pays des Soviets" recently sold
    for about \$3,450 at current exchange rates, making Herge what Mr.
    Crochelet termed "**the Van Gogh of** *the B.D.*"
65. [Grover Cleveland](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q35171)

    Tandy is the 60th person to participate in the campaign, said Peter
    Rogers, president and creative director, if Claudette Colbert, **the

66. [Kevin Costner](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11930)
    ([1991/10/06/0478532](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/06/arts/recordings-view-the-kevin-costner-of-country-music.html))
    Part of the reason for Mr. Brooks's success is marketing: with his
    meat-and-potatoes image, goony grin and virtuous all-American
    values, he is **the Kevin Costner of** *country*.
67. [Joyce Carol Oates](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q217557)
    ([1991/10/06/0478549](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/06/arts/recordings-view-now-a-prince-among-men.html))

    They all called her aloof; yet J.C. Alvarez, a former aide to
    Senator John Danforth and staffer at the E.E.O.C., suggested that
    she might want to turn her experience before the Senate into a book
    or movie, saying she wanted to be "**the Rosa Parks of** *sexual
    harassment*."
71. [Isaac Newton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q935)

    ([1991/10/29/0483487](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/29/opinion/topics-of-the-times-a-stargazer-s-playground.html))
    Gene Roddenberry, the creator and producer of "Star Trek," was **the
    Jules Verne of** *his time*.
76. [Saddam Hussein](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1316)
    ([1991/10/29/0483574](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/29/nyregion/wachtler-v-cuomo-duel-of-ex-friends.html))
    "I received a letter the other day which said the Governor has tried
    to make me **the Saddam Hussein of** *New York State*," said the
    Chief Judge, occasionally peeking through the Venetian blinds up the
    hill at the State Capitol, where the Governor sits.
77. [Diogenes](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12876261)
    ([1991/11/10/0485880](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/10/nyregion/campus-life-michigan-a-philosopher-challenges-campus-crowds.html))
    Terry Purvis-Smith, a visiting lecturer in composition, was
    attracted to Mr. Burke by a student essay on **the Diogenes of**
    *the Diag*.
78. [Benjamin Franklin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q34969)
    ([1991/11/10/0485953](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/10/books/children-s-books-one-spectacle-after-another.html))
    Olympic athletes, for instance, hardly ever wear glasses sprinting
    across the finish line, and neither do most rock stars when
    performing, excepting of course **the Ben Franklin of** *rock*,
    Elton John.
79. [Norman Rockwell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q271884)
    ([1991/11/12/0486441](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/12/news/umbrellas-closing-leaves-christo-with-empty-palette.html))
    This will not come as a blow to many art critics and Conceptual
    Artists, who have long regarded Christo as **the Norman Rockwell
    of** *Conceptual Art*, and his wrapping projects as a
    one-note exercise.
80. [Johnny Carson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q310819)
    ([1991/11/13/0486648](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/13/world/political-wing-of-ira-is-barred-from-dublin-municipal-building.html))
    was given prominence on national television by two of the best known
    figures in the country, former Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald and
    Gay Byrne, **the Johnny Carson of** *Ireland*.
81. [Donna Summer](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q908933)
    ([1991/11/13/0486749](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/13/arts/the-pop-life-968891.html))
    Aster Aweke, once known as **the Donna Summer of** *Ethiopia*, has
    recently released a new record, "Kabu" (Columbia), and it features
    her sinuous singing, backed by a full funky band, along with a
    horn section.
82. [Queen Victoria](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9439)
    ([1991/11/17/0487475](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/17/us/voter-poll-shows-big-edwards-lead-in-louisiana-race.html))
    He was introduced by the moderator at one candidates' forum as
    "**the Queen Victoria of** *Louisiana politics*" because he has been
    such a domineering figure for so long.
83. [John Fairchild](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3809254)
    ([1991/11/17/0487607](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/17/magazine/old-money-new-needs.html))
    Not until 1888 did Ward McAllister -- **the John Fairchild of** *his
    day* -- designate New York's "400," those who would be at ease, and
    not make others ill at ease, in the ballroom of Mrs. William B.
    Astor Jr., then the city's social doyenne.
84. [Robert Redford](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q59215)
    ([1991/11/20/0488274](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/20/us/on-the-past-and-future-of-a-politician-was-duke-made-for-tv-or-made-by-it.html))
    "He has become **the Robert Redford of** *hate*."
85. [Pablo Picasso](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5593)
    ([1991/11/23/0488925](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/23/nyregion/about-new-york-folks-take-my-unemployment-check-please.html))
    "I was **the Picasso of** *cardboard*," he said to
    scattered applause.
86. [Lauren Bacall](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q104000)
    ([1991/11/24/0489012](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/24/nyregion/dining-out-a-touch-of-class-at-the-head-of-the-class.html))
    France's Domaine Moussiere Sancerre of 1990 is described as "**the
    Lauren Bacall of** *sancerres* -- sultry, smoky, sophisticated," and
    Hidden Cellars Sauvignon Blanc of 1989 as "tangos on your taste buds
    with lemony melon flavors."
87. [Sergei Bubka](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q184556)
    ([1991/11/28/0490182](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/28/opinion/l-track-greats-competed-at-168th-street-armory-469291.html))
    Charles Hoff, **the Sergei Bubka of** *his day*, achieved the ninth
    of his 11 world indoor pole-vault records in 1926 at the armory on
    168th Street.
88. [Abraham Lincoln](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q91)

    "Andy's very wise, he's the Solomon, **the Abe Lincoln of**
    *Mayberry*.

    He's **the Babe Ruth of** *civil rights lobbyists*."
90. [Thomas Paine](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q126462)
    ([1991/12/08/0492265](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/08/business/technology-two-men-two-visions-of-one-computer-world-indivisible.html))
    Ted Nelson is an outspoken author and visionary described as
    everything from "**the Thomas Paine of** *the personal computer
    revolution*" to a "madman extraordinaire."
91. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1991/12/08/0492282](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/08/movies/bugsy-in-love-on-stage-and-off.html))
    She's **the Michael Jordan of** *actresses*.
92. [Ernie Banks](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3051017)
    ([1991/12/09/0492566](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/09/sports/sports-of-the-times-what-to-do-until-the-world-cup-comes-around.html))
    Sticking his hand in a glass bowl, Abedi Pele drew out the name of
    his own national team, Ghana, for an elimination round with seasoned
    Algeria and up-and-coming Uganda, making it possible for a star like
    Abedi Pele to become **the Ernie Banks of** *Africa*, never reaching
    the championship round in his sport.
93. [Willie Horton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8021572)
    ([1991/12/13/0493724](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/13/opinion/no-more-willie-hortons.html))
    If the Governor decides to run, the Rochester serial murderer could
    become **the Willie Horton of** *1992*.
94. [Brandon Tartikoff](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2923786)
    ([1991/12/17/0494773](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/17/sports/baseball-tv-sports-as-the-mets-turn-plot-heats-up.html))
    So in came the new executive producer, Al Harazin, trying to be
    **the Brandon Tartikoff of** *baseball*, turning around his series
    as Tartikoff overhauled NBC's prime-time schedule.
95. [Charles Barkley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q192707)

    Will John F. Akers be remembered as **the Mikhail Gorbachev of**
    *I.B.M.*?

1992
----

1.  [Paul Newman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41871)
    ([1992/01/09/0499117](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/09/theater/russian-actor-tells-of-chaotic-freedom-in-russian-theater.html))
    Although some in New York's Russian community have dubbed Mr.
    Solomin **the Paul Newman of** *Russia*, the bearded, 6-foot-tall,
    hazel-eyed performer bears more of a resemblance in person to the
    actor Robert Shaw, projecting the same on-stage gravitas and
    rugged introspection.
2.  [Amelia Earhart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3355)
    ([1992/01/17/0500887](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/17/news/at-the-bar.html))
    In New York State, it seems, **the Amelia Earhart of** *women's
    courtroom dress* was one Carolyn Peck of Syracuse.
3.  [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1992/01/24/0502719](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/24/sports/sports-of-the-times-some-teams-succeed-on-turmoil.html))
    The Bills are not necessarily in trouble in Sunday's Super Bowl just
    because Thomas wants to be known as **the Michael Jordan of** *his
    team*, leaving the implication that Jim Kelly, the quarterback, is
    merely Scottie Pippen.
4.  [Bugsy Siegel](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q315487)
    ([1992/01/26/0503490](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/26/sports/backtalk-get-ready-for-a-less-than-super-morning-after.html))
    Then there's Jerry Tarkanian, the bald, towel-chewing coach at the
    University of Nevada-Las Vegas whose vision of populating the desert
    with jump-shooting urban nomads has made him, to the National
    Collegiate Athletic Association, **the Bugsy Siegel of**
    *basketball*.
5.  [Ronald Reagan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9960)
    ([1992/01/27/0503557](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/27/world/free-for-all-seen-in-philippine-vote.html))
    The two candidates who top voter opinion surveys -- Senator Joseph
    Estrada, a grade B movie star who is sometimes described as **the
    Ronald Reagan of** *the Philippines*, and Miriam Defensor Santiago,
    a former immigration commissioner who is portraying herself as a
    dogged corruption fighter -- are being written off because they lack
    the backing of a large political machine.
6.  [Hulk Hogan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q44176)
    ([1992/01/30/0504397](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/30/nyregion/fishing-for-tourists-by-the-musconetcong.html))
    In the Delaware watershed, they say, the chinook salmon, a
    carpetbagger from the Pacific Northwest, would be **the Hulk Hogan
    of** *sport fish*, pursued with little finesse by anglers whose only
    goal is to land the biggest fish in the shortest time.
7.  [Willie Horton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8021572)
    ([1992/02/01/0504790](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/01/opinion/observer-and-go-to-sleep.html))
    (All right, kiddies: Dr. Huer was the scientific genius with the
    lightbulb-shaped head without whom Buck Rogers would surely have
    lost outer space to dark-eyed Killer Kane, who was sort of **the
    Willie Horton of** *the 25th century*.)
8.  [Carl Lewis](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131237)
    ([1992/02/15/0507721](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/15/sports/albertville-blair-strikes-gold-again-to-glide-to-us-history.html))
    But even if she did not, she has at least established herself as
    **the Carl Lewis of** *her sport*, its dominant sprinter.
9.  [Neil Simon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q315808)
    ([1992/02/16/0507808](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/16/nyregion/long-island-journal-121092.html))
    The association asked Fred Block, **the Neil Simon of** *Suffolk
    law*, to write a show, and, voila, the Island's first legal
    satirical revue was born.
10. [Norman Schwarzkopf](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q340137)
    ([1992/02/23/0509435](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/23/world/a-hero-who-forced-neapolitans-to-pay-bills.html))
    When people here dubbed Eduardo Ieno **the Norman Schwarzkopf of**
    *Naples*, it was because, by this city's standards, he had achieved
    something as decisive, bold and gutsy as the American general did in
    Kuwait: He forced Neapolitans to pay their water bills.
11. [Jesse Jackson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q310586)
    ([1992/02/26/0509904](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/26/us/the-1992-campaign-republicans-marching-through-georgia-guns-firing.html))
    "In some ways, he is sort of **the Jesse Jackson of** *the right*,"
    said Mr. Gingrich of Mr. Buchanan in an interview.
12. [Diamond Jim Brady](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1680077)
    ([1992/02/26/0510044](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/26/garden/de-gustibus-celebrating-rossini-s-birthday-and-his-truly-operatic-tastes.html))
    He was **the Diamond Jim Brady of** *his day*, with more than a
    touch of the rock star thrown in, as he was pursued by mobs of
    adoring fans in the street.
13. [J. P. Morgan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q54168)
    ([1992/02/27/0510163](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/27/business/a-new-momentum-at-mellon.html))
    Meanwhile, lending to blue-chip companies, which earned Mellon the
    sobriquet "**the J. P. Morgan of** *the Alleghenies*," has fallen
    slightly since 1986, to about 46 percent of assets from 50 percent.
14. [Charles Bronson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36105)
    ([1992/02/29/0510431](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/29/theater/review-theater-a-loved-wife-her-illness-and-her-last-gift-a-tear.html))
    And even his wife becomes "**the Charles Bronson of** *organic
    gardening*."
15. [George H. W. Bush](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23505)
    ([1992/03/08/0512675](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/08/opinion/public-private-a-far-better-thing.html))
    In that sense you are **the George Bush of** *New York City*, and
    what's going on here is not unlike what's going on in the
    Presidential races.
16. [Harold Stassen](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q887520)
    ([1992/03/08/0512675](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/08/opinion/public-private-a-far-better-thing.html))
    And there's **the Harold Stassen of** *New York*, Herman Badillo,
    and the Paul Tsongas of New York, Richard Ravitch.
17. [Paul Tsongas](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q283884)
    ([1992/03/08/0512675](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/08/opinion/public-private-a-far-better-thing.html))
    And there's the Harold Stassen of New York, Herman Badillo, and
    **the Paul Tsongas of** *New York*, Richard Ravitch.
18. [Galileo Galilei](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q307)
    ([1992/03/09/0512782](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/09/nyregion/metro-matters-spirit-of-newburgh-past-haunts-political-present.html))
    Senator Daniel P. Moynihan is no defender of Mr. Mitchell as **the
    Galileo of** *welfare reform*.
19. [Phil Donahue](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1336253)
    ([1992/03/14/0514005](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/14/business/fading-red-line-special-report-new-hope-inner-cities-banks-offering-mortgages.html))
    John V. Killen, an executive at Fidelity Bank, thinks of himself as
    **the Phil Donahue of** *the fair*.
20. [Arthur Murray](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2865273)
    ([1992/03/15/0514099](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/15/nyregion/long-island-journal-244692.html))
    When it became evident that Ms. Ryan's jig had an extra jive, she
    was sent to a dance teacher, Donny Golden of Mineola, **the Arthur
    Murray of** *Irish jigging*.
21. [Che Guevara](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5809)
    ([1992/03/20/0515459](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/20/us/1992-campaign-primaries-tsongas-abandons-campaign-leaving-clinton-clear-path.html))
    "Jerry Brown is going to be extremely dangerous," Mr. Hart said,
    "because in essence he's going to be **the Che Guevara of** *the
    1992 Presidential election*.
22. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([1992/03/24/0516396](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/24/sports/sports-of-the-times-can-soccer-grow-grass-under-foot.html))
    Now it happens that generous, kindly and peaceful soccer may be
    **the Johnny Appleseed of** *sports*, carrying real grass to domes.
23. [Willie Horton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8021572)
    ([1992/03/30/0517697](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/30/opinion/l-the-slow-motion-suicide-of-the-world-s-once-greatest-city-051492.html))
    You editorialize March 3 that I am turning New York into **the
    Willie Horton of** *1992* by suggesting that "New York and other
    large cities are responsible for their own dire fiscal straits
    because they are indifferent to rapacious unions."
24. [Charles Manson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q485508)
    ([1992/04/02/0518518](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/02/us/noriega-lawyer-derides-us-case-in-closing.html)) Mr.
    Rubino described Mr. Lehder, who is serving a term of life plus 135
    years in a Federal prison, as "**the Charles Manson of** *this
    case*," and suggested that his history of drug use made him an
    unreliable witness.
25. [Marcel Proust](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7199)
    ([1992/04/05/0519231](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/05/books/in-short-baseball-679592.html))
    For some reason he has rejected the gold (there is nothing, for
    example, from Roger Kahn, **the Proust of** *the Brooklyn Dodgers*)
    for the dross -- including selections by Steve Howe about his drug
    problems and by Steve Garvey about his marital problems, as well as
    an interminable piece by Tommy Lasorda, which reflects the manager's
    amiable logorrhea.
26. [Cameron Mackintosh](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q712928)
    ([1992/04/12/0520605](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/12/theater/theater-free-market-capitalism-applied-to-the-stage.html))
    "I want to be **the Cameron Mackintosh of** *Poland*," Mr. Kubiak
    said of the producer of "Miss Saigon" and other highly
    profitable musicals.
27. [Mother Teresa](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30547)
    ([1992/04/26/0523892](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/26/magazine/a-pilgrim-s-progress.html))
    To her fans, Annie Dillard is an avatar, or at the very least, as
    Bernays puts it, "**the Mother Teresa of** *her particular genre*."
28. [Chuck Yeager](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q271939)
    ([1992/05/07/0526474](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/07/sports/sports-of-the-times-hawk-flew-long-before-jordan-did.html))
    But if Jordan is **the Chuck Yeager of** *basketball*, Julius Erving
    was its Charles Lindbergh and Connie Hawkins was its
    Wright Brothers.
29. [Al Capone](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q80048)
    ([1992/05/10/0527307](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/10/books/crime-377892.html))
    field agent was not your run-of-the-mill public servant, but a rabid
    zealot ("**the Al Capone of** *the auditors*"), Jill could use a
    traffic cop to sort out all the suspects eager to dance on the dead
    man's grave.
30. [Willie Horton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8021572)
    ([1992/05/11/0527805](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/11/nyregion/metro-matters-as-relief-rolls-grew-where-was-gop-in-office.html))
    If welfare emerges as **the Willie Horton of** *1992*, Mr. Cuomo may
    have wound up on the wrong side of it in a national campaign, even
    though he sought to curb the soaring costs of social
    spending programs.
31. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([1992/05/13/0528150](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/13/sports/baseball-yankees-stop-losing-on-a-deft-perez-start.html))
    So Hall, who had earlier called himself **the Rodney Dangerfield
    of** *the American League* because he was omitted from the All-Star

    "Gordon is **the Stanley Kramer of** *theater producers*," said

    the film maker best known for his liberal movies of the 1950's
    and 60's.
33. [Harry Houdini](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131545)
    ([1992/05/14/0528618](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/14/nyregion/republicans-pressed-on-plans-for-cuts.html))
    "Over the past two years, Governor Florio has become **the Harry
    Houdini of** *state government*," he said, "inventing one trick
    after another to disguise massive overspending.
34. [Leo Tolstoy](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7243)
    ([1992/05/17/0529227](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/17/books/unscrambling-africa.html))
    It is easy to sympathize with African resentment of the attitude
    epitomized by Mr. Trevor-Roper, or for that matter by Saul Bellow
    asking, "Who is **the Tolstoy of** *the Zulus*?"
35. [Dred Scott](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q480427)
    ([1992/05/22/0530662](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/22/us/execution-stirs-up-troubling-questions.html)) Mr.
    Coleman's lawyer, Kathleen A. Behan, a member of Arnold & Porter who
    was not representing Mr. Coleman when the filing deadline was
    missed, said the case would be remembered as "**the Dred Scott of**
    *death penalty law*."
36. [Jackie Robinson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q221048)
    ([1992/05/24/0531233](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/24/sports/golf-when-racial-barriers-die-hard.html))
    Though he dislikes the comparison because the rate of blacks
    entering professional golf has actually diminished, he is often
    called **the Jackie Robinson of** *golf*.
37. [Francis Scott Key](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q320633)
    ([1992/05/29/0532182](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/29/news/bar-gone-are-tie-dyed-shirts-marijuana-woodstock-era-guitarist-covets-judicial.html))
    It was "Country Joe" McDonald, **the Francis Scott Key of** *the
    Vietnam era*, who dominated the movie, at one point leading 500,000
    fans in an obscene variant of a familiar high-school cheer.
38. [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([1992/06/01/0533054](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/01/sports/sports-of-the-times-here-s-a-soda-for-buck-leonard.html))
    In those years he and the Grays' catcher, the late Josh Gibson, were

    Even today, the infomercial remains **the Rodney Dangerfield of**
    *advertising*, shunned and doubted for many reasons: state and
    Federal investigations of infomercial producers, complaints about
    product performance and, most crucial, a belief that a lengthy
    commercial disguised as a conventional program -- like a talk show
    complete with host, theme song and studio audience -- unfairly masks
    what is nothing more than a sales spiel.
40. [Freddie Laker](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1349086)
    ([1992/06/05/0533783](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/05/business/company-news-germans-to-buy-britain-s-thomas-cook-chain.html))
    He was **the Freddie Laker of** *his time*: just as Mr. Laker and
    imitators like People Express opened up air travel to the masses in
    the late 1970's, Mr. Cook, the creator of the packaged holiday,
    opened up the world of international leisure travel to the middle
    class of the last century.
41. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)

    ([1992/06/11/0535323](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/11/arts/pop-and-jazz-in-review-731192.html))
    In a way, Skinny Puppy is more effective with the invisibility of
    recordings than it is onstage; sometimes, Ogre can come across as
    **the Alice Cooper of** *industrial rock*.
43. [William Shakespeare](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q692)
    ([1992/06/14/0536108](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/14/nyregion/long-island-journal-975692.html))

    ([1992/06/14/0536121](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/14/style/the-queen-of-hearts.html))

    ([1992/06/21/0537499](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/21/style/cuttings-rescuing-what-is-left.html))
    If I wasn't such a softy, I'd rip it out and start over, but this
    cuke is **the John Wayne of** *the cucurbit world*.
46. [Robin Leach](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7352612)

    Miss Chenchikova, for instance, is **the Jimmy Connors of**
    *ballet*: She throws herself full force into her dancing without
    regard to niceties of form.
48. [Holly Woodlawn](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1091285)
    ([1992/07/10/0541591](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/10/movies/review-film-russian-madame-bovary-familiar-but-no-imitation.html))
    At times she looks like an older version of **the Holly Woodlawn
    of** "*Trash*."
49. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([1992/07/12/0542029](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/12/sports/horse-racing-two-thirds-of-a-tiara-for-turnback-the-alarm.html))
    Her trainer, Red Terrill, has been saying for months that she was
    "**the Rodney Dangerfield of** *horses*," the one who got
    no respect.
50. [Omar Bradley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q207955)

    In an army that has as many men in running shoes and jeans jackets
    as in camouflage fatigues, Col. Divjak has become **the Omar Bradley
    of** *the war*, the soldiers' soldier who prefers to be where the
    action is.
51. [Dan Quayle](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49214)
    ([1992/07/16/0543182](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/16/opinion/essay-the-me-too-democrats.html))

    Kim Zmeskal, a ferocious competitor and legitimate challenger to
    Svetlana Boginskaya of the Unified Team for the Olympic all-around
    title in gymnastics, could become **the Mary Lou Retton of** *1992*.
54. [Lowell Thomas](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q943107)

    If Mr. McKay presented himself as **the Lowell Thomas of** *the

    Jungle Ride.
55. [Greta Garbo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5443)

    ([1992/08/11/0549300](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/11/business/media-business-advertising-putting-olympic-torch-games-commercials.html))
    Worse, perhaps, than the continual cheerfulness of Bob Costas --
    **the Dick Clark of** *Barcelona* -- or the quantity of the
    advertising was its quality, or lack thereof.
60. [Ross Perot](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q313697)
    ([1992/08/16/0550630](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/16/weekinreview/don-t-look-back-as-bush-runs-again-history-nips-at-his-heels.html)) Mr.

    Keating, 48 years old, has been described as **the Lyndon B. Johnson

    ([1992/08/31/0553711](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/31/opinion/essay-justice-corrupts-justice.html))
    However, Mr. Dragoul now has a new pro-bono lawyer -- Bobby Lee
    Cook, "**the Ed Williams of** *the South*" -- who is said to
    understand that concealing the truth about the Government's guilty
    knowledge of bank fraud is not the best way to obtain leniency from
    Judge Shoob.
65. [Christopher Columbus](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7322)

    Although the 50-year-old Brazilian singer and songwriter has been

    As Frank's life devolves into various slapstick (and unconvincing)
    scenes that would fit comfortably into the screenplay of a B movie,
    his daughter, Holly, tries to reunite her parents by shacking up
    with Lane Lawlor, a right-wing fanatic whom Frank calls "**the Lord
    Haw-Haw of** *the northern Rockies*."

    ([1992/11/06/0568315](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/06/sports/horse-show-learning-not-to-look-a-mount-in-the-eye.html))
    She describes herself as "**the Donald Trump of** *the horse show
    world*," buying and selling horses like so many pieces of real
    estate, pocketing a profit and never shedding a tear as she watches
    her property being trucked away.
89. [Roger Maris](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q741023)
    ([1992/11/12/0569742](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/12/business/the-media-business-advertising-pay-tv-is-looking-to-score-knockout.html))
    It brought in more than \$50 million in pay-per-view billings from
    1.45 million homes, "sort of **the Roger Maris of** *pay-per-view
    events*," Mr. Abraham said, mixing his sports.
90. [Stephen King](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q39829)
    ([1992/11/15/0570452](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/15/arts/lucia-as-a-spine-tingler.html))
    It is almost an exact analogy to call Sir Walter Scott **the Stephen
    King of** *his day*.
91. [Pat Buchanan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q149127)
    ([1992/11/15/0570584](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/15/nyregion/l-views-of-fisher-case-a-motley-group-459092.html))
    The first was from Barbara Ehrenreich, **the Pat Buchanan of**
    *radical feminism*, calling Mr. Buttafuoco a "Guido-type person,"
    and then, lest you miss the slur, asking pardon for "the obnoxious
    ethnic reference."
92. [Madonna](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1744)
    ([1992/11/15/0570735](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/15/style/egos-ids-fun-all-the-way-to-the-bank.html))

93. [Barry Bonds](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q314712)
    ([1992/11/19/0571427](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/19/sports/baseball-yanks-still-smarting-after-taking-a-loss.html))
    The 27-year-old Hayes is not **the Barry Bonds of** *third basemen*,
    and he might have had a career season when he hit .257 and delivered
    18 homers and 66 runs batted in, but he silenced the criticism at a
    troubling position, and now the nagging questions will start again.
94. [Martin Luther King, Jr.](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8027)
    ([1992/11/26/0572900](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/26/style/on-the-river-bank-with-billy-frank-jr-indians-and-salmon-making-nature-whole.html))
    Don't expect boilerplate Euro-bashing from Mr. Frank, who has been
    called **the Martin Luther King of** *American Indians*.
95. [Lord Byron](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5679)
    ([1992/11/29/0573421](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/29/arts/pop-music-leonard-cohen-the-lord-byron-of-rock-and-roll.html))
    Leonard Cohen, **the Lord Byron of** *Rock-and-Roll*
96. [Donald Trump](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686)
    ([1992/12/13/0576115](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/13/books/the-priest-and-the-runaways.html))
    Father Ritter himself was often mentioned in the same sentence with
    Mother Teresa, but perhaps Charles M. Sennott's phrase, "**the
    Donald Trump of** *Catholicism*," better captures the personal drive
    and entrepreneurial spirit that led to Covenant House's
    phenomenal growth.
97. [Bill Gates](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5284)
    ([1992/12/13/0576218](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/13/business/making-a-difference-silicon-valley-s-laugh-man.html))
    "I'M **the Bill Gates of** *computer culture*," says Jeff Armstrong,
    who's been satirizing the Microsoft chairman and lesser members of
    the industry for six years as one of the world's first
    high-tech comedians.
98. [Tom Cruise](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37079)
    ([1992/12/13/0576330](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/13/world/mission-to-somalia-marines-and-somalis-2-worlds-meet.html))

    It is perfectly in tune with revisionist French versions of "Romeo
    and Juliet" set on the Eastern side of the Berlin wall, Swedish
    productions like Mr. Ek's "Swan Lake," which puts men as well as
    women in tutus just like "The Hard Nut" and the kind of "Giselle"
    with spoken text that Mr. Gallotta, **the Mark Morris of** *France*,
    threatens to put on next year.
100. [Red Adair](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q589905)
    ([1992/12/20/0577852](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/20/weekinreview/the-world-a-lame-duck-diplomat-wrestles-with-a-world-in-flux.html))
    LAWRENCE S. EAGLEBURGER doesn't look much like **the Red Adair of**
    *foreign policy*, flaunting his lame-duck status with a crippled
    bird pin stuck in his lapel.
101. [Vanilla Ice](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q313578)
    ([1992/12/27/0579154](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/27/arts/the-year-in-the-arts-pop-jazz-1992-a-lonely-couch-a-dash-of-sex-so-why-the-yawns.html))

    Or will the waspish host of television's first post-modern talk show
    turn out to be **the Joey Bishop of** *the 1990's*?
5.  [Ross Perot](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q313697)
    ([1993/01/15/0583131](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/15/us/24-candidates-jostle-in-the-stampede-to-be-the-next-mayor-of-los-angeles.html))
    A conservative, he is widely called "**the Ross Perot of** *Los

    Erving was **the Michael Jordan of** *his time*, but what a
    different time that was.
11. [Joyce Carol Oates](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q217557)
    ([1993/02/11/0589685](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/11/garden/at-the-science-museum-with-stephen-jay-gould-an-evolving-celebrity.html))

    ([1993/02/22/0592045](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/22/arts/review-television-beaming-up-new-science-fiction.html))
    Less elaborate science-fiction than clever adventure caper, "The
    Tomorrow People" is lively and imaginative entertainment, its
    international cast featuring Kristian Schmid, an Australian
    18-year-old soap star who, Nickelodeon insists, has become **the
    Luke Perry of** *London*.
13. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([1993/02/23/0592228](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/23/style/chronicle-836393.html))

    approach any chains or discount stores, she said, "Now I'm thinking
    maybe I should just go across the country with my books and my red
    ribbons and be **the Johnny Appleseed of** *AIDS ribbons*."

    Wasn't she **the Grace Kelly of** *the Himalayas* who in 1963 went
    to live in a palace in Gangtok as the bride of the Chogyal, a man
    revered by his subjects as the reincarnation of an ancient Buddhist
    holy man?

    All the great Latin bands came through, from Oscar D'Leon, **the
    James Brown of** *Latin music*, to Eddie Palmieri, the music's
    crazy, brilliant uncle; Mario Bauza, Tito Puente, Celia Cruz, El
    Gran Combo and Mongo Santamaria all showed up.
19. [Alain Marcel](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q18179336)
    ([1993/03/10/0595190](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/10/theater/in-europe-musicals-get-varying-reactions.html))
    First, it used a slightly adapted version of Tony Walton's set from
    the 1987 revival at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, with stage
    direction (by **the Alain Marcel of** *Berlin*, Helmut Baumann, who
    runs the Theater des Westens) that stuck closely to the New
    York version.
20. [Hillary Clinton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6294)

    Lofton senses that the Cleveland Indians -- **the Rodney Dangerfield

    The person pushing the bill is none other than Sir George Young, a
    gawky housing minister who fights for the poor and homeless in that
    traitor-to-his-class spirit and is lately lampooned by The Spectator
    as "**the Che Guevara of** *the leaseholders*."
26. [Jerry Lewis](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q294927)

    For himself, Mr. Lang leaves his options open, not precluding a run
    for the presidency after Mr. Mitterrand retires (a prospect that
    makes his detractors, those who see him as **the Jerry Lewis of**
    *politics*, cringe at his presumption).
27. [Jimi Hendrix](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5928)
    ([1993/03/26/0598111](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/26/arts/sounds-around-town-554993.html))

    Thomas F. McLarty 3d, President Clinton's childhood friend whom they
    all call Mack and who is now White House chief of staff, was the

    Roger Corman, **the Louis B. Mayer of** *B Movies*, earned his

    ([1993/04/04/0600140](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/04/style/deep-in-the-soul-of-texas.html))
    She is kind of **the Jessica Lange of** *Austin*: she's been
    romantically linked with all the cool guys.
32. [Albert Speer](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60045)
    ([1993/04/07/0600666](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/07/theater/review-theater-lacerating-greed-and-decay-but-doing-it-with-humanity.html))
    A former Peace Corps volunteer and the child of leftist Russian
    Jews, he now works for an American company that sells "**the Albert
    Speer of** *baby formulas*" to third-world countries and is so
    notorious it once co-starred on "60 Minutes" with Union Carbide and
    the Dalkon Shield.

    ([1993/04/23/0604282](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/23/movies/review-film-dialing-911-don-t-bother.html))
    is loaded with rap-related cameos that work only if you recognize
    the players (Fab 5 Freddy, Kid Capri, Naughty by Nature and **the
    Bob Hope of** *rap cinema*, Ice-T), and have little intrinsic humor
    of their own.
39. [Busby Berkeley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q503258)
    ([1993/04/25/0604418](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/25/theater/lighting-candle-for-hair-25-tom-o-horgan-tribal-what-it-was-supposed-be-tribal.html))
    At 66, the man who once qualified as **the Busby Berkeley of** *the
    acid set* is right back where he started -- directing what he calls
    "these nutty pieces" in out-of-the-way places for audiences that
    tend to number in the dozens, not the thousands.
40. [George Foreman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213919)

    Fittingly, **the Patrick Henry of** *this drama* is an
    American-trained lawyer, Anselm B. Clouden, who by evoking the

    She may not, as some of her activists-in-arms suggest, be **the
    Mother Teresa of** *progressive politics*, but she will, by all

    office that has suffered through a series of less-than-attentive,
    let-them-eat-cake administrators for roughly a dozen years.

    Considerably more sensational are a startling photograph by the San
    Francisco artists Aziz and Cucher that shows a male nude whose
    genitals have been rubbed out through computer wizardry -- a kind of
    off-the-charts idealization -- and Alexander Hahn's "Urbs Turrita,"
    an installation consisting of three television tubes whose strange
    mix of old and new images, which include the tubes themselves set in

    The woman with the answers, **the Agnes Nixon of** "*Decision*" --
    soap-opera fans the world over know Agnes Nixon as the, uh, guiding

    An outspoken Florentine who started as a busboy 13 years ago and
    popularized his interpretation of the fresh simple cuisine of his

1.  [Ed Sullivan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q83807)

    Does he become **the Ed Sullivan of** *foreign policy*, managing a
    really good show but enjoying no stardom himself?
2.  [Pete Seeger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q244441)
    ([1994/01/07/0660595](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/07/arts/sounds-around-town-803332.html))
    Ladino, one of the three major Jewish languages, has produced a rich
    and extensive repertory of Judeo-Spanish songs, many of which have
    been collected by Joseph Elias, who is regarded as **the Pete Seeger
    of** *Ladino music*.
3.  [William Shakespeare](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q692)
    ([1994/01/09/0660857](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/09/nyregion/sorting-myth-from-reality-was-barnum-wronged.html))
    Barnum was basically a great showman, Mr. Pelton said, a master of
    advertising -- a Yale professor once called him **the Shakespeare
    of** *advertising* -- and of crowd psychology.
4.  [Charles Barkley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q192707)

    Once she caught her breath, which wasn't easy given a hacking attack
    of asthma, Tonya Harding called herself **the Charles Barkley of**
    *figure skating* late Saturday night, then proceeded to verbally
    slam-dunk her competition at the coming Winter Olympics.
5.  [Salvador Dalí](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5577)
    ([1994/01/16/0662187](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/16/arts/when-the-kult-of-the-kustomized-kar-was-king.html))

    When Miss Harding, who has described herself as **the Charles
    Barkley of** *skating*, told reporters, "If anybody wanted to beat
    Nancy it was me," the wording sounded a little strange.
7.  [Ernest Hemingway](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23434)
    ([1994/01/20/0663246](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/20/books/books-of-the-times-a-toast-to-love-and-a-literary-family.html))

    ([1994/02/04/0666537](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/04/movies/critic-s-notebook-when-hollywood-could-be-naughty.html))
    The terrors of the code, as overseen by Joseph Breen (who was
    nicknamed "**the Hitler of** *Hollywood*" in some quarters), went
    beyond the letter of the document and brought about a more
    generalized moral purge.
11. [Joseph Conrad](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q82925)
    ([1994/02/06/0667236](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/06/books/reader-by-reader-and-town-by-town-a-new-novelist-builds-a-following.html))

    One of his rare detractors paid him a backhanded compliment by
    dubbing him "**the Oral Roberts of** *prevention*."

    Yet Saturday's cross-country dispatch from the Nordic combined
    competition by Phil Liggett, **the Ben Wright of** *the snow*, and
    Jeff Hastings, sparkled with action and emotion.
16. [Oliver Stone](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q179497)

    It is the sort of effect that has made Mr. Svetlanov an unquestioned
    master of overpowering orchestral spectacle, **the Oliver Stone of**
    *conductors*.
17. [Joe Carter](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3178736)
    ([1994/02/23/0670493](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/23/sports/baseball-mattingly-sticks-with-the-here-and-now.html))

    Unbeknownst to Jack until it's too late, his hostage, Natalie Voss
    (Kristy Swanson), happens to be the only daughter of a
    publicity-hungry billionaire (Ray Wise) known as "**the Donald Trump
    of** *California*."
21. [Anne Frank](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4583)
    ([1994/03/06/0672558](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/books/a-little-girl-s-war.html))
    If only the French publishers of "Zlata's Diary" had never thought
    or spoken the phrase "**the Anne Frank of** *Sarajevo*"!

    As the Fairground Boy, Jon Marshall Sharp (late of "The Red Shoes")
    sports a bare torso under a black leather vest and has the right

    ([1994/05/01/0684057](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/01/travel/sherlock-holmes-inc.html))
    The inevitable memorial tablet, in English, at the lower terminal of
    the cableway reads: "Across this 'dreadful cauldron' occurred the

    ([1994/05/02/0684570](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/02/arts/review-ballet-elevated-passion-and-sexual-repression.html))
    In earlier years, he was **the Harold Pinter of** *dance*, largely
    because what he left unsaid in his studies of relationships was as
    important as what he expressed directly.

    As a veteran of the Congress Party governments led by Mr. Nehru's
    daughter, Indira Gandhi, and grandson, Rajiv Gandhi, the
    72-year-old Mr. Rao has become, in effect, **the Deng Xiaoping of**
    *India* -- an aging party leader who, in his sunset years, has
    abandoned many, if not all, of the economic precepts that had guided
    earlier governments, challenging not only the old orthodoxies but an
    entrenched network of vested interests that had built up under the
    old system.
39. [Aldrich Ames](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q452267)
    ([1994/05/08/0685978](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/08/opinion/journal-the-real-paula-jones.html)) Mr.

    Frazier is **the Bill Stern of** *basketball analysis*, an

42. [Magic Johnson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q134183)
    ([1994/05/13/0687037](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/13/sports/sports-of-the-times-scary-idea-mason-more-assertive.html))
    Once upon a time, Mason could have been **the Magic Johnson of**
    *Turkey or Venezuela*, a very large man with superior
    open-court dribbling.
43. [Blaine Trump](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q27804586)
    ([1994/05/22/0688818](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/22/style/feet-first-into-the-clubs.html))
    (If there is a club worth going to, Mr. McGrath, **the Blaine Trump
    of** *lower Manhattan*, is on its permanent guest list.)
44. [Peter Lynch](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1156395)
    ([1994/05/22/0688898](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/22/business/the-kids-managing-america-s-money.html))
    One is William H. Gross, 50, managing director of the Pacific
    Investment Management Company and sometimes called **the Peter Lynch
    of** *the bond business*.
45. [Bette Midler](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q190631)
    ([1994/05/24/0689343](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/24/movies/reviews-television-once-again-rashomon-meets-the-menendezes.html))
    At one point, Erik's lawyer, Leslie Abramson, **the Bette Midler
    of** *the criminal courtroom*, stuck tacks into the photograph of a
    naked child's torso for shamelessly vivid illustration.
46. [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([1994/05/25/0689494](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/25/nyregion/about-new-york-an-archive-of-louis-and-jazz.html))
    He was the natural, **the Babe Ruth of** *jazz*, and before the word
    crossover had any meaning, he was one of very few black men who were
    listened to or watched by whites in an America so much whiter than
    it is now.
47. [T. E. Lawrence](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170596)
    ([1994/05/29/0690176](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/29/arts/step-up-folks-check-it-out-nationhood.html))
    If Istanbul is **the T. E. Lawrence of** *world capitals*, sword
    unsheathed and racing on horseback toward another clash with
    history, then Washington is Indiana Jones -- handsome and dashing in
    its porkpie hat and bullwhip, but only playing a part.
48. [Anthony Trollope](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q318399)
    ([1994/06/05/0691458](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/05/books/american-sicko.html))
    If Raymond Carver, **the Anthony Trollope of** *American white
    trash*, had been just a little bit nuttier -- and was still alive
    and writing -- or if Stephen King could write at all, either one of
    them would be proud to produce something like "Pluto, Animal Lover."
49. [Marcel Marceau](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q157191)
    ([1994/06/05/0691809](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/05/nyregion/on-sunday-better-schools-by-consensus-not-conflict.html)) Mr.

    uttering nothing while brightly demonstrating inclusiveness.
50. [Mel Gibson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q42229)
    ([1994/06/08/0692271](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/08/arts/review-television-bohemians-of-boheme-reawaken-as-beatniks.html))
    David Hobson, who I'm told is sometimes referred to as **the Mel
    Gibson of** *opera Down Under*, is a dashing Rodolfo, even managing
    to look meltingly sensitive in a black leather jacket.
51. [Pat Boone](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q342778)
    ([1994/06/20/0694707](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/20/arts/in-performance-pop-449822.html))
    If Vanilla Ice is **the Pat Boone of** *hip-hop*, watering down a
    vibrant black musical form to make it appeal to a generic pop
    audience, then G. Love is its Elvis Presley.
52. [Norman Podhoretz](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q945011)
    ([1994/06/26/0695595](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/26/books/from-a-wellspring-of-bitterness.html))
    Edward Said thus becomes **the Norman Podhoretz of** *the
    Palestinians*.
53. [Hugh Hefner](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q194280)
    ([1994/06/26/0695640](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/26/movies/film-art-deco-meets-the-industrial-revolution.html))
    THE FILM BEGINS IN Tibet, where Cranston is, in the words of Mr.
    Baldwin, "like **the Hugh Hefner of** *Tibet*."
54. [Cyndi Lauper](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1545)
    ([1994/06/30/0696637](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/30/garden/trying-to-smoke-with-christopher-buckley-more-huffing-than-puffing.html))
    Discussing his new novel, "Thank You for Smoking," Christopher

    If Jones was **the Michael Jordan of** *her time*, scoring at will,

    had said, referring to the hero of the 1982 World Cup championship.
60. [Farrah Fawcett](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q102341)
    ([1994/07/10/0698493](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/10/style/wicked-fashion-sitcom-delicious-pity-it-s-fiction.html))
    Much of the delight in the 48-year-old Ms. Lumley, a familiar
    actress in Britain, comes from the fact that she has played a
    succession of cool, glamorous, upper-class women, including a James
    Bond girl in the film "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" and a secret
    agent in "The New Avengers," a 1976 British television series that
    made her a sex symbol, **the Farrah Fawcett of** *public-school
    boys*.
61. [Tennessee Williams](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q134262)
    ([1994/07/17/0699777](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/17/theater/hey-kids-let-s-put-on-a-show.html))

    ([1994/07/17/0699913](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/17/nyregion/theater-theater-s-lively-summer-season.html))
    Warren Kliewer, its artistic director, has on a tentative September
    schedule "The Truth," a vintage comedy by Clyde Fitch, who has been
    variously called the American Oscar Wilde and **the Neil Simon of**
    *the 19th century*.
64. [Gary Busey](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q312081)
    ([1994/07/17/0699963](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/17/nyregion/confessions-of-an-in-line-commuter.html))
    (I like to think of myself as **the Gary Busey of** *in-line
    skating*, since Mr. Busey is still vehemently opposed to wearing a
    helmet even after having applied his head firmly to the pavement in
    a motorcycle accident.)
65. [John D. Rockefeller](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q160278)
    ([1994/07/18/0700205](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/18/us/undercover-ge-special-report-fbi-inquiry-jet-engines-new-jolt-company-image.html))

    But such conspicuous spending only enhances Turner's image here as
    **the Armand Hammer of** *post-Communist Russia* -- the most
    ubiquitous, best-connected American businessman.
68. [James Stewart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q102462)
    ([1994/07/28/0702482](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/28/movies/hollywood-closing-out-a-summer-of-the-unexpected.html))

    In many ways, Wendell Smith was **the Jackie Robinson of** *sports
    journalism*.

    ([1994/08/04/0704092](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/04/sports/pro-football-on-loan-from-olympus-marino-plans-new-ascent.html))
    Dan Marino, **the Lou Gehrig of** *quarterbacks*, had surely been
    dipped in the waters of the river Styx.
72. [Eppie Lederer](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3308441)
    ([1994/08/07/0704518](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/07/education/end-paper-ode-to-academic-nastiness.html))
    Daniel S. Hamermesh, a professor of economics at the University of
    Texas at Austin who has published several articles on academic
    etiquette and jokingly calls himself **the Ann Landers of** *higher
    education*, says he thinks young professors "may be even meaner than
    their predecessors because they grew up in the 'Me Generation,'
    believing that virtually everything is due them."
73. [Rush Limbaugh](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q319072)
    ([1994/08/08/0704966](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/08/nyregion/call-in-host-calls-out-for-anti-tax-ballot-spot.html))
    Three years after Connecticut adopted an income tax, Tom Scott,

    ([1994/08/12/0705713](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/12/obituaries/jean-dominique-fratoni-casino-owner-71.html))
    The press called Mr. Fratoni **the Napoleon of** *the green tables*;
    to friends in politics and in the milieu, as the Riviera's criminal
    underground is known, he was Jean-Do.
75. [Pol Pot](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q39464)
    ([1994/08/12/0705807](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/12/opinion/abroad-at-home-the-hidden-horror.html))

    Someone -- often a contemporary composer trying to address the
    masses -- is always remarking with approval that Mozart tailored his

80. [David Duke](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q163042)

    In the fall issue of The American Scholar, in an anguished, angry
    article titled "A Loss for Words: Plagiarism and Silence," Mr.

    Libby's cousin Andrew, an art director who's "so incredibly creative

    Her husband, 54, praises her "guts and courage" in overcoming
    tremendous obstacles, like the time a trumpet section walked out in
    protest when the conductor turned out to be a woman, and he eagerly
    calls her "**the Sandra Day O'Connor of** *the music world*."

    WILLIAM MAYNE has a wonderful creation in Hob, a protective

    ([1994/11/13/0725345](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/13/obituaries/wilma-rudolph-star-of-the-1960-olympics-dies-at-54.html))

    ([1994/12/04/0729197](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/04/books/christmas-books-94-travel.html))
    A seasoned foreign correspondent, she often finds herself preceded
    by an eager James A. Baker 3d, then Secretary of State, as she
    grills people like Askar Akaev, "**the John F. Kennedy of** *Central
    Asia*," an upbeat physicist who was elected President of what she
    sees as the only genuinely democratic new republic in the region,
    mountainous Kyrgyzstan.
108. [Greg Norman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q381941)

    She's **the Martina Navratilova of** *gymnastics*, is what she is.
110. [Lorenzo de' Medici](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q177854)
    ([1994/12/18/0731771](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/18/books/he-who-smuggles-must-learn-to-party.html))
    Over the years, this man, whom one of the Russian artists calls
    "**the Lorenzo de' Medici of** *Russian art*" spent more than \$3
    million of his own money, operating under secretive and quasi-legal
    conditions that posed considerable risk both to himself and to the
    artists whom he befriended and patronized on his many trips to the
    former Soviet Union.
111. [George Mikan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q314185)

    ([1995/01/02/0734637](https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/02/business/winds-of-change-hit-music-s-top-tier.html))
    FUTURE: Some industry executives call Mr. Knight **the Spielberg
    of** *hip-hop*, but they wonder if he can stay out of legal trouble.
2.  [Auguste Rodin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30755)

    His friend the Marquis de Lafayette recommended D'Angers, **the
    Rodin of** *his time*, as anyone visiting the Louvre's Richelieu
    Court can see.
3.  [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([1995/01/05/0735173](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/05/us/the-104th-congress-talk-radio-true-believers-rejoice-in-babylon.html))
    The office of Rush Limbaugh, **the Babe Ruth of** *the talk-show
    circuit*, said Mr. Limbaugh was on vacation.

    The need to cut either welfare or promised retirement benefits
    exists only in the political posturing that is **the Willie Horton
    of** *the 1990's*.
5.  [Camille Paglia](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q255463)
    ([1995/01/13/0736539](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/13/arts/art-in-review-036995.html)) Ms.
    Minter seems to be flirting with the idea that there is something
    glamorous as well as perverse about the sexual obsessions she
    chronicles; perhaps she wants to be **the Camille Paglia of** *the
    visual arts*.
6.  [Marco Polo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6101)
    ([1995/01/15/0737073](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/15/books/surrounded-by-zealots.html))
    A friend of his, he tells us, gave him a chronicle of the famous
    14th-century North African traveler Ibn Battuta (**the Marco Polo
    of** *Islam*, he has been called), who left his Moroccan birthplace,
    at the age of 21, on travels that took him, over the course of 30
    years, eastward to India and China, northward to Central Asia and
    deep into Africa.
7.  [Ted Turner](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q193368)

    He has been **the Ted Turner of** *his sport*, at times colorizing
    it unmercifully, but ever able.
8.  [Samuel Pepys](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q106143)
    ([1995/01/15/0737169](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/15/magazine/on-washington-america-s-front-lawn.html))
    Pugh presents himself as **the Samuel Pepys of** *the park*, witness
    to the eerie, violent goings-on.
9.  [Cornelius Vanderbilt](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q313721)
    ([1995/01/19/0737800](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/19/business/building-a-railroad-deep-into-brazil.html))
    If the mild-mannered entrepreneur wants to become **the Cornelius
    Vanderbilt of** *late 20th-century Brazil*, his compatriots learned
    long ago not to laugh at his vision of a private railroad extending
    across Brazil's western frontier.
10. [Jackie Joyner-Kersee](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q209390)
    ([1995/01/20/0738148](https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/20/sports/women-who-soar-the-friendly-skies.html))
    Raschker, **the Jackie Joyner-Kersee of** *Masters track and field*,
    has won dozens of other national and world titles in the sprints,
    hurdles, jumps and heptathlon.
11. [Dizzy Gillespie](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49575)
    ([1995/02/01/0740755](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/01/garden/cooking-up-a-storm-in-atlanta.html))
    One might doubt that the cheek of a halibut would constitute a
    substantial repast for a healthy adult, but the thick, meaty portion
    seems to have come from **the Dizzy Gillespie of** *the deep*.
12. [Joan Rivers](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q240933)
    ([1995/02/01/0740881](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/01/nyregion/curriculum-or-not-teachers-teach-values.html))
    At age 59, Mrs. Fue looks and acts like **the Joan Rivers of**
    *Woodstown*.
13. [Philip Johnson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q183528)
    ([1995/02/05/0741684](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/05/magazine/reimagining-berlin.html))
    Probably no one has profited more from this system than Josef
    Kleihues, who has become **the Philip Johnson of** *Berlin* -- an
    eminent architect with an unusual combination of political power and
    esthetic clout.
14. [Mother Teresa](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30547)
    ([1995/02/06/0741881](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/06/us/mother-teresa-of-houston-fights-hunger-and-government-aid.html)) Mrs.
    Porter was once called "**the Mother Teresa of** *Houston*," and she
    is no less experienced in dealing with the news media.
15. [Mario Cuomo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q521145)
    ([1995/02/09/0742308](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/09/us/pete-wilson-and-96-race-a-coy-natural.html))

16. [Adolf Hitler](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q352)
    ([1995/02/10/0742588](https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/10/world/new-delhi-journal-a-demon-housecleaner-to-clean-india-s-house.html))
    A recent editorial in The Hindustan Times, one of the country's most
    influential newspapers, described Mr. Seshan as "**the Fuhrer of**
    /the Indian poll 'Reich'/ " for his habit of issuing directives that
    his critics say reach far beyond election statutes.
17. [Robert Novak](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1954907)
    ([1995/02/11/0742594](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/11/arts/critic-s-notebook-discussing-the-budget-zzzzzz-z-z-z.html)) Mr.
    Will ventured so far as to try to get Ms. Rivlin to say something
    one could understand about the relation between the budget and
    interest rates, and even Sam Donaldson, **the Robert Novak of** *the
    middling left*, avoided treating the subject as if it were a
    wrestling match.
18. [Ed Asner](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q154421)
    ([1995/02/12/0742777](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/12/movies/television-hey-it-s-not-sondheim-but-adults-don-t-care.html))
    Characters that never saw the light of day include Nipsy and Russell
    (either two possums or two raccoons), Bossy Beaver and Doyle ("sort
    of **the Ed Asner of** *beavers* and his moronic sidekick") and the
    amoeba stars of "As the Petri Dish Turns."
19. [Franz Kafka](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q905)
    ([1995/02/12/0743054](https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/12/style/the-lasting-edge-of-diane-arbus.html))
    Robert Frank and Lee Friedlander may have racked up as many honors,
    and Richard Avedon may have gained wider name recognition, but none
    of them can claim to possess her black-crepe glamour as **the Kafka
    of** *American photography*.
20. [Frank Perdue](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5488961)
    ([1995/02/13/0743158](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/13/business/visiting-russian-governor-meets-idol-frank-perdue.html))

    With his black hair parted slightly to the right, Holman was the
    playmaker, **the Magic Johnson of** *his time*.
22. [Kurt Cobain](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8446)
    ([1995/02/19/0744055](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/19/arts/classical-view-a-requiem-for-amadeus.html))
    Some possible portents of doom: a recording that advertises
    Beethoven's Fifth Symphony as "the 'Star Wars' of symphonic music"
    and Ludwig van B. himself as **the Kurt Cobain of** *his
    generation*; a famous young virtuoso playing "The Four Seasons" in a
    music video broadcast on the Weather Channel; arousing anthologies
    of "Sensual Classics" aimed at heterosexual or homosexual listeners;
    disks of Arvo Part's music stamped with a descriptive blurb from
    Michael Stipe of R.E.M.
23. [Bill Gates](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5284)
    ([1995/02/19/0744341](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/19/business/a-japanese-gambler-hits-the-jackpot-with-softbank.html))
    They call him **the Bill Gates of** *Japan*.
24. [Tina Turner](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131814)
    ([1995/02/28/0745877](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/28/style/patterns-351395.html))
    If Bill Blass has one more season as outstanding as his last two, he
    will have earned the right to be called **the Tina Turner of** *the
    fashion industry*.
25. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([1995/03/05/0746816](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/05/sports/sports-of-the-times-the-march-madness-has-already-begun.html))
    But in 1974, Brent Musburger started broadcasting the college
    tournament for CBS and became **the Johnny Appleseed of**
    *alliteration*, using the phrase he had known as a high school
    reporter for the old Chicago American.
26. [Sol Hurok](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4535129)
    ([1995/03/13/0748567](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/13/arts/latin-festival-pays-homage-to-a-legendary-club.html))
    Ralph Mercado, now **the Sol Hurok of** *Latin music in New York*,
    did the booking.
27. [Ralph Lauren](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q296647)
    ([1995/03/14/0748676](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/14/style/review-fashion-from-young-designers-familiar-echoes.html))
    The shift here from commercial power to the search for the creative
    was most apparent by the turnout for Fabio Piras, another recent St.
    Martin's graduate, who scheduled his runway show at the same time
    that Margaret Howell, considered **the Ralph Lauren of** *London*,
    was holding her first runway show in 15 years.
28. [Abdul Sattar Edhi](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q317465)
    ([1995/03/17/0749200](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/17/world/karachi-journal-in-a-hellish-city-there-s-still-a-kind-of-saintliness.html))
    "No -- I'd rather call Mother Teresa **the Abdul Sattar Edhi of**
    *Calcutta*."
29. [Madonna](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1744)
    ([1995/04/01/0752308](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/01/obituaries/grammy-winning-singer-selena-killed-in-shooting-at-texas-motel.html))
    With her pouting smile, suggestive clothing and theatrical command
    of a microphone, Selena was often described as **the Madonna of**
    *the Mexican-American world* and was an idol and heartthrob on both
    sides of the border.
30. [Homer](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6691)
    ([1995/04/02/0752494](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/02/magazine/the-emasculation-of-sports.html))
    Roone Arledge of ABC emerged as **the Homer of** *an enormously
    profitable televised mythology that brought us epic battles in
    slo-mo and instant replay*.
31. [Madonna](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1744)
    ([1995/04/02/0752494](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/02/magazine/the-emasculation-of-sports.html))
    He was **the Madonna of** *his time*, especially by 1969, when he
    guaranteed a Super Bowl victory for his underdog team,
    and delivered.
32. [Ralph Nader](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q193156)
    ([1995/04/09/0753814](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/09/nyregion/with-gimlet-eye-restaurants-zagat-man-not-book-makes-his-nightly-rounds.html))
    In three hours of stepping in and out of a limousine and in and out
    of restaurants, some fancy, some less so, he was greeted by
    strangers who clearly saw him as a crusader for good in the world,
    **the Ralph Nader of** *food*, Our Man in the Public Dining Room.
33. [Arthur Ashe](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q53325)
    ([1995/04/14/0755076](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/14/sports/hockey-getting-used-to-idea-of-no-cup-and-no-nectar.html))
    Just a 19-year-old amateur, but disciplined, talented, and a social
    diplomat, Woods may be **the Arthur Ashe of** *the Nineties*.
34. [Bill Bradley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q504025)
    ([1995/04/14/0755076](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/14/sports/hockey-getting-used-to-idea-of-no-cup-and-no-nectar.html))
    Here is Rebecca Lobo, **the Bill Bradley of** *the Nineties*, smart,
    nice, dedicated, the cover girl of the University of Connecticut's
    unbeaten National Collegiate Athletic Association championship team.
35. [Robert Maxwell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q333468)
    ([1995/04/23/0757457](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/23/books/the-inflamation.html))
    The cause of all this fuss and feathers is that -- brace yourself --
    he fired one agent (the wife of his close friend, the novelist
    Julian Barnes), and hired another, Andrew Wylie, an American now
    referred to in the British papers as "the Jackal" and "**the Robert
    Maxwell of** *agenting*," who got him a juicy advance for the
    British edition, rumored to be close to \$800,000.
36. [Benedict Arnold](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q298237)
    ([1995/04/24/0757794](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/24/business/information-technology-meaning-digital-life-publishers-sell-remedies-for.html))
    But he has received a barrage of angry electronic-mail messages from
    cyberspace regulars, accusing him, Mr. Stoll says, of being "**the
    Benedict Arnold of** *the computer world*."
37. [Marshall McLuhan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q193871)
    ([1995/04/24/0757794](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/24/business/information-technology-meaning-digital-life-publishers-sell-remedies-for.html))
    In a sense, this is a race to emerge as **the Marshall McLuhan of**
    *the 90's*, a popular interpreter of digital technology, the way
    Professor McLuhan served as the sage of the mass media in the 1960's
    and 70's.
38. [Cary Grant](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q83410)
    ([1995/05/01/0759317](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/01/obituaries/henry-rogers-82-press-agent-who-built-hollywood-stars.html))
    "He was **the Cary Grant of** *public relations*," Mr. Cowan said.
39. [Annie Lennox](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q151231)
    ([1995/05/02/0759532](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/02/arts/pop-review-is-this-mood-music-or-music-that-s-moody.html))
    Siouxsie Sioux (originally Susan Janet Dallion), the leader of
    Siouxsie and the Banshees, is **the Annie Lennox of** *the
    gothic-rock underground*, whose denizens were in full force at
    Roseland in black gowns and capes, black eyeliner, black hair dye

    But Fumio Matsuda, who is head of the Japan Automobile Consumers

    Long ago, Lindros was anointed by the system, declared to be **the

    She is a veteran of the last years of Hollywood's studio system, an
    Academy Award-winning actress with more than 40 films to her credit,
    a touring hoofer-singer-headliner in her own lounge act, a
    reincarnation advocate who (at least in my local bookstore, where
    the New Age section shelf placards read "The Unexplained,
    UFO-related, Wicca, Out-of-Body, Shirley MacLaine") has created a
    whole new area of metaphysical study, and, given that "My Lucky
    Stars" is her eighth autobiographical work, she is by now
    practically **the Joyce Carol Oates of** *Hollywood memoirists*.

    Because of that lyricism, coupled with his good looks, he was also
    once labeled "**the Rupert Brooke of** *the Depression*," in a

    In an opinion article published today in The Los Angeles Times, Mr.
    Jackson wrote that Mr. Wilson was "**the Susan Smith of** *national

    Dean is called **the Babe Ruth of** *arm wrestling* because he was
    the undisputed champ from 1978 to 1986, retired, got divorced, went
    into a depression, ballooned to 700 pounds, then dieted by "cutting
    out the fat in my food," he said, came back to arm wrestling last
    year and won the championship again in October.

    ([1995/09/03/0786550](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/03/arts/recordings-view-dastardly-doings-in-elysium-lavishly-scored.html))
    A poster headed "Two Jewish Scribblers," a denunciation of Schreker
    and Ernst Toch, called Schreker "**the Magnus Hirschfeld of** *opera
    composers*," referring to a famous psychiatrist of the day, and

    ([1995/09/10/0787852](https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/10/style/weddings-dawn-m-gangi-jeffrey-schwartz.html))
    Descriptions of Mr. King as "a street Machiavelli, a ghetto
    Einstein" and of Muhammad Ali as "**the Einstein of** *the Sweet
    Science*" hit the eye like a head-butt, and calling Ali's victory
    over George Foreman "an epic, a miracle, a revolution" throws
    rhetoric over the event while illuminating nothing.

    evocatively named pair -- Fantasy of Italy Hair Design just south of
    Dyckman, and Fantastic Unisex at 149th Street -- and the Broadway
    Barber Shop at 104th, where Kay Demetriou, apparently **the Cal
    Ripken of** *barbers*, has not missed a day of snipping and shaving,
    he says, in more than 50 years.

    Ezsterhas, **the Andrew Dice Clay of** *screenwriting*, bludgeons
    the audience with such tirelessly crude thoughts that when a group
    of chimps get loose in the showgirls' dressing room and all they do
    is defecate, the film enjoys a rare moment of good taste.

    To the Editor: In his piece on Franz Schreker \[ "Dastardly Doings
    In Elysium, Lavishly Scored," Sept. 3 \] , Jamie James refers to
    Magnus Hirschfeld as "a famous psychiatrist of the day" in the
    context of noting that a Nazi poster had slanderously called
    Schreker "**the Magnus Hirschfeld of** *opera composers*."

    George Gershwin adored the brassy singing of Ethel Merman, **the

    It is tempting, but too easy, to think of Ansel Adams as simply

    Now he is in a position roughly equivalent to head of programming at
    a television network or production chief at a movie studio; he finds

    Brandon Tartikoff of** *cyber-space*.

    In the year that has passed since Mr. Salinas was last seen
    publicly, he has become **the Elvis of** *former presidents*.
38. [Édith Piaf](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1631)
    ([1996/04/08/0842399](https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/08/nyregion/chronicle-061131.html))
    In a place like the Monkey Bar, I had to be able to play everything
    from tangos to the songs of Om Kalsoum," the late singer he
    described as "**the Edith Piaf of** *Egypt*."
39. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([1996/04/11/0842911](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/11/sports/baseball-20-million-yankee-pitcher-will-throw-in-the-minors.html))
    in 25 1/3 innings) and won 44 games for the Texas Rangers over the
    last three years to the former Mets pitcher's 15, Rogers has
    inexplicably been treated like **the Rodney Dangerfield of** *the
    Yankee staff*.
40. [Errol Flynn](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q93188)
    ([1996/04/21/0845200](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/21/books/a-compulsion-for-music.html))
    This prideful detachment was, of course, a mask: though one friend
    admiringly called him "**the Errol Flynn of** *losers*," others
    realized that Wilder was simply too unsure of his own gifts to make
    the fullest use of them.
41. [Rush Limbaugh](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q319072)
    ([1996/04/21/0845244](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/21/nyregion/atlantic-city-gadfly-with-a-bite.html))
    Harry Hurley is "**the Rush Limbaugh of** *Atlantic City*," said a
    competing morning talk radio host, Don Williams of WOND-AM, whose
    dominance of 14,000 listeners has been challenged by Mr. Hurley's
    growing popularity.
42. [George Washington](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23)
    ([1996/04/25/0846131](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/25/nyregion/on-day-2-the-tug-of-romance-outweighs-the-price-of-history.html))
    "To me, David Ben-Gurion is **the George Washington of** *the State
    of Israel* and Jackie Kennedy was the queen of the United States,"
    he said.
43. [T. Berry Brazelton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3106664)
    ([1996/04/25/0846208](https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/25/garden/the-housemother-of-the-show-house.html))
    "I just treat them like children," said Mrs. MacDougall, **the T.

    He won such wide acclaim that he was sometimes called "**the Picasso
    of** *commercial artists*," and his work was included in the
    permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the
    Smithsonian Institution.
45. [Red Skelton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1277029)
    ([1996/05/05/0848246](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/05/magazine/robert-thurman-doesn-t-look-buddhist.html)) Prof.
    P. Jeffrey Hopkins of the University of Virginia, Thurman's
    colleague and fellow translator, calls him "**the Red Skelton of**
    *Tibetan Buddhism*."

    She was hailed as "clearly **the Mother Teresa of** *the small
    screen*."
47. [Mahatma Gandhi](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1001)
    ([1996/05/06/0848753](https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/06/world/india-s-avenging-angel-candidate-of-low-castes.html))
    Elsewhere, the 36-year-old candidate has been mobbed by enthusiastic
    lower-caste villagers who seem delighted by her description of
    herself as "**the Gandhi of** *Mirzapur*" -- meaning Mohandas K.
    Gandhi, the leader of India's freedom struggle and, most Indians
    would say, the greatest of all its crusaders for the poor.
48. [Elvis Presley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q303)
    ([1996/05/06/0848805](https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/06/business/business-digest-028134.html))
    Why, Perhaps, It's Called Classical If television is **the Elvis
    of** *communications technologies* and the Internet is Nirvana,
    radio is more like Bach.
49. [Marie Taglioni](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q203990)
    ([1996/05/06/0848831](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/06/arts/in-performance-028398.html)) Ms.
    Kent has become **the Marie Taglioni of** *the 1990's*, but with
    spunk, a dancer whose poetic lyricism calls to mind descriptions of
    that great 19th-century ballerina.
50. [James Brown](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5950)
    ([1996/05/08/0849224](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/08/arts/music-in-review-032395.html))
    He's **the James Brown of** *salsa*, with a tightly choreographed
    set and precise pop arrangements for his tunes.
51. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1996/05/10/0849554](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/10/business/columbia-hca-to-pay-blue-cross-officials.html)) "Mr.

    In 1980, three years after he founded the Croquet Association, the
    governing body of the sport in the United States, Mr. Osborn said,
    "I look forward to the time when I can go from one city to another,
    52 weeks a year, like **the Johnny Appleseed of** *croquet*."

    At the fireside, Mr. Dlamini told the story of Shaka, **the Genghis
    Khan of** *the Zulus*, from his illegitimate birth in a minor clan
    to his leadership of armies that swept southern Africa in the early
    19th century.
54. [Dennis Rodman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q201608)

    "Some people say Claire Shulman is **the Golda Meir of** *Queens*,"
    said John S. Dyson, the outgoing Deputy Mayor for Economic
    Development and Finance, responsible for cultural financing.

    ([1996/05/26/0853475](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/26/sports/basketball-as-nets-wait-for-pitino-magic-may-wait-in-wings.html))
    Still, this is New Jersey, **the Charlie Brown of** *franchises*,
    where high expectations get tangled like a kite in a tree, where
    "good grief" is a normal post-game comment.
58. [John Robinson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q723274)
    ([1996/05/28/0853767](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/28/nyregion/episcopal-bishop-hails-victory-on-gay-priests.html))
    "If I could be remembered as **the John Robinson of** *my

59. [Adlai Stevenson I](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q310839)
    ([1996/06/02/0854862](https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/02/weekinreview/in-israel-fears-decide-which-road-not-to-travel.html))
    It should have been no great surprise that a significant majority of
    Israeli Jews would vote their fears in an anxious time, finding Mr.
    Peres, whose aloofness and political stumbles make him **the Adlai
    Stevenson of** *Israeli politics*, less credible on the issue that
    mattered most to them: security.
60. [Ross Perot](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q313697)
    ([1996/06/09/0856237](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/09/nyregion/about-long-island-an-unlikely-candidate-in-east-hampton.html))

    It said that since there seems to be a general consensus that Gates
    is **the Edison of** *his day*, you ought to hit him up for money.
62. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([1996/06/12/0857282](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/12/business/lexmark-makes-money-but-does-not-excite-investors.html))
    ''I call Lexmark **the Rodney Dangerfield of** *printer
    companies*,'' said Steve Milunovich, an analyst at Morgan Stanley &
    Company, which co-managed the company's November offering.

    Whatever their origin, it is unlikely the walks came about without
    the permission, if not the involvement, of William H. Reynolds,
    **the Robert Moses of** *Long Beach*.
64. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1996/06/14/0857634](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/14/sports/hockey-smith-s-goal-baby-blueshirts.html))
    He said he would bid on free agents "if **the Michael Jordan of**
    *hockey*" becomes available.
65. [Virgil](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1398)
    ([1996/06/16/0858002](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/16/books/the-dammed.html))
    A historian and journalist by training, he has nonetheless striven
    for years to bear witness to Montana history in fiction, and to
    become if not the Homer at least **the Virgil of** *generations of
    Scots who migrated to northwestern Montana before and after it
    became a state in 1889*.
66. [P. T. Barnum](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766)

    But Kevin J. Kinsella, known as **the P. T. Barnum of** *biotech*,
    has come very close to living the myth.
67. [Christopher Columbus](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7322)
    ([1996/06/26/0860266](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/26/garden/for-germans-a-kebab-filled-with-social-significance.html))

    Ayh lived only a few more years and seems to have been **the Millard
    Fillmore of** *Pharoahs*.
69. [Thurgood Marshall](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q312348)
    ([1996/07/03/0862081](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/03/opinion/single-sex-schools-and-double-standards.html))
    Her decision, in fact, can be read in several ways, and not all of
    the interpretations are easy to reconcile with the vision of
    equal-treatment feminism that she championed as **the Thurgood
    Marshall of** *the women's movement in the 1970's*.
70. [John Barrymore](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q95034)
    ([1996/07/05/0862461](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/05/arts/happy-trails-along-the-hudson.html))
    FOR most of this century, the Hudson has been **the John Barrymore
    of** *rivers*, noble in profile but a sorry wreck.
71. [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([1996/07/06/0862685](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/06/nyregion/finding-way-swing-for-fences-softball-helps-recovering-addicts-learn-discipline.html))
    Precious is her name, but at the plate she is the power lady, **the
    Babe Ruth of** *a no-nonsense league*.
72. [Paul Revere](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q327071)
    ([1996/07/06/0862725](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/06/arts/librarians-challenge-offering-internet.html)) Ms.
    Turock, 59, blond, with a voice like honey, has been called "**the
    Paul Revere of** *the Information Age*" by the Librarian of
    Congress, James Billington.
73. [Thomas Jefferson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11812)

    And I guess you could say Frank Thomas is **the Thomas Jefferson
    of** *baseball*."
74. [Sam Walton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q497827)
    ([1996/07/14/0864251](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/14/magazine/a-fundamental-problem.html))
    Though little known to the general public, Dobson is **the Sam
    Walton of** *the family values movement*, a distributor with
    unparalleled reach.
75. [Mark Twain](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7245)
    ([1996/07/21/0866407](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/21/arts/the-new-sound-of-early-music.html))
    The image I always have is, this is a river town, and he's like
    **the Mark Twain of** *early music*.
76. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([1996/07/25/0867025](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/25/garden/where-to-find-it-folding-chairs.html))
    meetings and bridge parties, folding chairs, **the Rodney
    Dangerfield of** *the home-furnishings world*, are stashed in a
    closet when not in use.
77. [Michael Johnson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q190924)
    ([1996/07/27/0867603](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/27/sports/sports-of-the-times-low-profile-high-drama-competition.html))
    Godina, competing in his first Games, considered himself **the
    Michael Johnson of** *shot-putters*.
78. [Frank Gifford](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1261570)
    ([1996/07/28/0867931](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/28/sports/sports-of-the-times-our-man-on-line-one-hand-on-remote-one-on-mouse.html))
    There were potshots at other commentators, most notably John Tesh,
    whom Todd called "**the Frank Gifford of** *gymnastics*.
79. [Margaret Thatcher](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7416)

    For Benjamin Netanyahu, the conservative new Prime Minister, cutting
    those subsidies and slashing that work force rank high in a quest to
    become **the Margaret Thatcher of** *Israel*.
80. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1996/08/03/0869199](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/03/sports/brazil-s-female-stars-finally-have-a-medal.html))
    And, of course, **the Michael Jordan of** *Brazilian basketball for
    the past 20 years*, has simply been known as Oscar.
81. [Michael Johnson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q190924)
    ([1996/08/04/0869687](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/04/sports/atlanta-day-16-tennis.html))
    It's one thing to win a gold medal, but the way he dominated, he was
    **the Michael Johnson of** *the tennis field* today.''
82. [Charlie Parker](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103767)
    ([1996/08/09/0870295](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/09/movies/a-postcard-picture-of-a-graffiti-artist.html))
    But for all its admiration, ''Basquiat'' winds up no closer to that
    assessment than to the critic Robert Hughes's more jaundiced one:
    ''Far from being **the Charlie Parker of** *SoHo* (as his promoters
    claimed), he became its Jessica Savitch.''
83. [Aesop](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q43423)
    ([1996/08/09/0870300](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/09/movies/parables-that-blend-love-and-philosophy.html))
    Eric Rohmer's ''Rendezvous in Paris'' is an oasis of contemplative
    intelligence in the summer movie season, presenting three graceful
    and elegant parables with the moral agility that distinguishes Mr.
    Rohmer as **the Aesop of** *amour*.
84. [Billy Graham](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213550)
    ([1996/08/09/0870316](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/09/arts/masterworks-on-vacation-at-the-met.html))
    As in the past, the preponderance are Venetian pictures: Tiepolos,
    Guardis, Canalettos and a Jacopo Bellini that is surgically precise,
    and movingly so: a small depiction of the sallow, toothless and
    hollow-eyed St. Bernardino of Siena, who as a popular preacher was
    something like **the Billy Graham of** *Bellini's day*.
85. [Ayn Rand](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q132524)
    ([1996/08/11/0870785](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/11/books/all-this-and-heaven-too.html))
    That would probably be bearable if the books weren't getting
    progressively less readable; but she's **the Ayn Rand of** *the
    spirit realm*.
86. [Michelangelo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5592)
    ([1996/08/13/0871265](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/13/us/fleeing-the-ghost-of-1992.html))
    The people who ran things four years ago are out, and people who
    made Republican images in happier days are back -- people like
    Michael J. Deaver, **the Michelangelo of** *the balloon drop*, and
    the joint impresarios here, William I. Greener 3d and Paul J.
    Manafort, who both made their names in the 1980's, heyday of
    Ronald Reagan.
87. [Oprah Winfrey](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q55800)
    ([1996/08/16/0871746](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/16/us/ideals-and-grit-and-a-vast-imponderable.html))
    They bemoaned its dearth of fresh ideas and its reliance on the
    technological and dramatic capabilities of television, epitomized by
    Elizabeth Dole's performance as **the Oprah Winfrey of** *nominating
    night*.
88. [Jimi Hendrix](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5928)
    ([1996/08/19/0872309](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/19/arts/reveling-in-retro-pop-ear-piercings-only.html))
    He even tried to be **the Jimi Hendrix of** *the harp*, performing a
    distorted solo version of ''The Star-Spangled Banner,'' complete
    with modulated feedback.
89. [Jim Carrey](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40504)
    ([1996/08/22/0872803](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/22/opinion/ted-s-excellent-idea.html))
    America's flashiest extrovert, **the Jim Carrey of** *capitalism*,
    has gone existential on us.
90. [Tommy Hilfiger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q136687)
    ([1996/08/25/0873205](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/25/business/how-young-is-too-young-for-ceo-s.html))

91. [John Grisham](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q106465)
    ([1996/08/25/0873390](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/25/movies/from-saturday-night-live-to-jane-austen.html))
    And this was before, of course, I knew that Jane Austen was going to
    turn out to be **the John Grisham of** *the Romantic novel set*.''
92. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([1996/08/25/0873426](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/25/books/final-judgments.html))
    But alas, **the Rodney Dangerfield of** *Saddle River* got no

    In its award citation, the Swedish Academy noted that Ms. Szymborska

    Having once sold farmers' digests to feed stores, **the Henry Ford
    of** *journalism* returned to America from World War I and began his
    new magazine in 1922, condensing articles in longhand in the New
    York Public Library, typing them up and delivering the pieces by
    hand to a mail train for the printers; by the late 1920's,
    subscriptions were being handled by the Pleasantville Women's Club,
    and by 1936, unfazed by the Depression, his secular Good News Bible

    Then, raising ambivalence to the level of an art form, Mr. Milazzo
    suggests that Realism has become **the Rodney Dangerfield of**

    ([1996/12/03/0893306](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/03/business/banner-ads-on-internet-attract-users.html))

    ([1996/12/22/0896921](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/22/movies/a-free-speech-hero-it-s-not-that-simple.html))
    He is **the Horatio Alger of** *the sexual revolution*, a poor
    Kentucky boy who parlays a string of seedy Ohio strip joints into a
    porn publishing empire, getting rich and having fun while thumbing
    his nose at the establishment.

    Jules Verne was **the Michael Crichton of** *the 19th century*, a
    fabulist whose ability to link technology with imagination to create
    riveting pop-culture products was uncanny.

    Singing and rapping amid the sonic detritus of four decades, **the
    Bob Dylan of** *the digital-sampling era* ponders the death of

    After all is said, after all is done, Sam Brach, Holocaust survivor,

    It also isn't known why the local Shona people weren't living in
    cities when the hunter-explorer Adam Renders arrived in 1868,
    although this slice of Africa was in turmoil from droughts, disease,
    slavers and invasions by whites and by rival tribes fleeing the
    fierce empire-building of Shaka, **the Attila of** *Zululand*,
    hundreds of miles to the south.
9.  [Clint Eastwood](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q43203)

    As Mr. Dowlin arrived in San Francisco nine years ago, a local

    Kenny G. (whose last name is Gorelick) is **the Perry Como of**
    *saxophonists*, a crooner of comforting melodies, the musical
    equivalent of warm milk.
12. [Eddie Vedder](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q221535)
    ([1997/02/09/0907512](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/09/arts/american-pie-25-years-ago-america-listened.html))
    On the stark black-and-white cover of his next album, he is seen
    hunched over, staring grimly; its songs bemoaned his fame, making
    him **the Eddie Vedder of** *his day*.
13. [Chris Mullin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q289398)
    ([1997/02/10/0907989](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/10/sports/a-few-still-wait-for-felipe-lopez.html))
    He was going to be St. John's savior of the 90's, **the Chris Mullin
    of** *color*, except that Lopez's jump shot was never as feathery
    and he had no way of knowing that the tribe he was joining was about
    to be leveled by storm.
14. [Shelby Foote](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q714250)
    ([1997/02/16/0909196](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/16/arts/whose-thomas-jefferson-is-he-anyway.html))
    I gradually began to conjure up the image of Joseph Ellis as **the
    Shelby Foote of** *the film*, recalling that sales of Mr. Foote's
    books had gone up exponentially after his bravura performance in the
    landmark Burns film on the Civil War.

    ([1997/02/16/0909447](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/16/sports/parcells-is-the-bully-that-new-york-needs.html))
    And unlike Riley, he isn't trying to divert us with Hamptons hair
    and Soho suits while he babbles pop sports psych (ironically, Riley
    may have been **the Typhoid Mary of** /the Knicks' ''Disease
    of Me''/) that distances all messages.
17. [Wynton Marsalis](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q273076)
    ([1997/02/16/0909448](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/16/sports/long-wait-in-a-windy-blind-before-the-goose-is-cooked.html))
    Cornicelli, who is a masterful caller, honked like **the Wynton
    Marsalis of** *goose hunting*.
18. [Regis Philbin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q463673)
    ([1997/02/17/0909645](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/17/business/political-books-become-less-sober-more-pop-oriented.html))
    Some of this, of course, stems from the fact that 1996 was **the
    Regis Philbin of** *recent campaigns*: politics was omnipresent but
    so bland as to pass unnoticed.
19. [Harold Stassen](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q887520)
    ([1997/02/18/0909767](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/18/sports/in-the-driver-s-seat-without-driver-s-education.html))
    He's **the Harold Stassen of** *Daytona*.
20. [Pablo Picasso](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5593)
    ([1997/02/23/0910736](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/23/arts/mergings-of-history-myth-and-dream.html))
    Bihzad was one: the Raphael, the Rembrandt, **the Picasso of**
    *Persia in his day*, the artist whose name was synonymous with
    art itself.
21. [Paul Gauguin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37693)
    ([1997/02/23/0910763](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/23/nyregion/long-island-journal-704377.html))
    Now she is **the Gauguin of** *Great Neck*.

    ([1997/02/23/0910902](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/23/style/brioche-and-buzz-at-power-lit-101.html))
    He was apparently forgetting that Ms. Winfrey is already **the Oprah
    Winfrey of** *literature*.
23. [Rosa Parks](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41921)

    Haley said she found herself contemplating the contrast between such
    derisive comments with the more common praise for her mother, whom
    experts called **the Rosa Parks of** *the affordable housing
    movement*.
24. [Joe Namath](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q720558)
    ([1997/03/09/0914501](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/09/nyregion/a-new-bid-for-bid-whist.html))

    ([1997/03/19/0916691](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/19/us/counting-the-missiles-dreaming-of-disarmament.html))
    Considered **the Rosa Parks of** *Cheyenne's anti-bomb
    movement*, Mrs. Laybourn was the lone voice of protest over the
    arrival of Atlas missiles at Warren's nuclear command in 1958.
26. [Bill Clinton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1124)
    ([1997/03/23/0917392](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/23/books/the-master-of-monticello.html))
    The story of ''Dashing Sally,'' as Mr. Ellis writes, is ''the
    longest-running mini-series in American history'' -- making
    Jefferson **the Bill Clinton of** *his time*.
27. [Cornelius Ryan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q463975)
    ([1997/03/23/0917504](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/23/nyregion/the-human-dimensions-of-america-s-bloodiest-war.html))
    He might be called **the Cornelius Ryan of** *the Civil War*,
    producing the same sort of history-as-drama Ryan created with World
    War II books like ''The Longest Day'' and ''A Bridge Too Far.''
28. [Ernest Hemingway](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23434)
    ([1997/03/27/0918474](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/27/garden/16-countries-and-still-speaking.html))
    They were led by Ms. O'Neill, **the Ernest Hemingway of** *bargain
    hunters*, whose militarily precise organizational abilities cause
    her husband to describe her as ''a force of nature.''
29. [Michelangelo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5592)
    ([1997/03/29/0918913](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/29/sports/thomas-is-kentucky-except-on-the-court.html))
    And when he's referred to as **the Michelangelo of** *coaching*, I
    really think that's a very appropriate term.''
30. [Ed McMahon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q555370)
    ([1997/04/06/0920768](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/06/arts/a-fellowship-of-angels-and-america.html))
    Hank, **the Ed McMahon of** /the fictional talk show at the center
    of HBO's popular ''Larry Sanders Show,''/ suddenly became a devout
    Jew in one episode and angered his colleagues by insisting on
    wearing a yarmulke.
31. [Leslie Caron](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q230023)
    ([1997/04/13/0922363](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/13/nyregion/writing-novels-in-a-painterly-fashion.html))
    ''I would have a beautiful little atelier, meet **the Leslie Caron

    This remarkable man became **the Bill Gates of** *his era* by
    electrifying streetcars, and went on to invent the railroad air
    brake system used today, and the modern elevator.
33. [Andy Warhol](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5603)
    ([1997/04/13/0922638](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/13/style/listen-up-talk-radio-this-is-the-internet-speaking.html))
    In blue slacks, polo-style shirt and white sneakers, Mr. Harris
    looks more like an off-duty accountant than **the Andy Warhol of**
    *Silicon Alley*, New York's new-media mecca.
34. [George Burns](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q344793)
    ([1997/04/15/0922983](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/15/science/long-evolution-of-darwin-of-20th-century.html))
    That is not to say that Dr. Mayr cannot be charming, even pointedly
    humble, making practiced jokes about himself and his age, sounding
    like **the George Burns of** *evolutionary biology*.
35. [Jackie Robinson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q221048)
    ([1997/04/19/0923823](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/19/opinion/tiger-s-double-bogey.html))
    But the 21-year-old who is often described as **the Jackie Robinson
    of** *golf* blew off Jackie Robinson -- and the Fan in Chief.
36. [Ernie Banks](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3051017)
    ([1997/04/20/0924364](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/20/sports/once-ubiquitous-lalas-a-sure-starter-no-more.html))
    On Sunday, he would like to become **the Ernie Banks of** *soccer*
    with a let's-play-two approach to a doubleheader in Foxboro, Mass.
37. [Tiger Woods](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q10993)
    ([1997/04/20/0924370](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/20/sports/a-prodigy-finds-skeptics-in-the-crowd.html))

    ([1997/04/27/0925650](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/27/nyregion/on-the-towns-779040.html))

    ([1997/05/02/0926963](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/02/sports/a-ripple-of-recognition-follows-robinson.html))
    As Doby tells it, Veeck was more than just **the P. T. Barnum of**
    *baseball*, more than just exploding scoreboards and novelty acts,
    despite the indelible image of the midget Eddie Gaedel at bat.
42. [Christian Lacroix](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q350844)

    Naturally, he likes Howard Stern, **the Rodman of** *radio*, much
    more than he likes David Stern, the National Basketball Association
    daddy figure, who will eventually be judged by how well he controls
    the stars who test him; maybe those box-office Roman candles needed
    hugs and spankings earlier.

    The complex aural and visual style of ''The Pillow Book'' involves
    rectangular insets that flash back to Sei Shonagon (a kind of
    Windows 995) and illustrate the imperious little lists that made her
    sound like **the Diana Vreeland of** *10th-century tastes*.

    Thalassa Cruso, an authority on plants who was known as ''**the

    Sommer's Wolsey (a part, like Katherine, favored by
    legendary actors) is great fun as **the Machiavel of** *the first
    acts* (he has that perfect, ironed-on politician's smile), but less
    convincing in his big ''farewell to all my greatness'' speech.

    Buoyed by the book's success, he is exploring possible ''Gift of
    Fear'' workshops for the public, and he is talking about a ''Gift of

    ''When I was a student in 1961, the rap on me was that I could be

    All that is really clear is that Gemma, the silent one, is married

    He describes Arafat's transformation from a courageous guerrilla
    leader -- who told President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt as late as 1988

    Where else but in Nathanael West's old neighborhood, where
    self-invention was invented, could a geeky guy who once managed the
    CBS gift shop here transform himself into the country's reigning

    that has made him **the Walter Winchell of** *the World Wide Web*?

    Danny DeVito embodies this as a gleeful Sid Hudgens (a character
    whom Mr. Hanson has called ''**the Thomas Edison of** *tabloid

    In June 1993, when President Clinton nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg
    to the Supreme Court, he called her **the Thurgood Marshall of**
    *the women's rights movement*, self-consciously comparing her work

    He has said the compliment he most cherishes is one that called him
    ''**the Goddard Lieberson of** *publishing*'' -- a reference to the
    president of Columbia Records who in the 1950's helped pioneer the
    recording of Broadway musicals and spoken word, spurred John
    Hammond's talent scouting and supported the signing of the
    blacklisted Pete Seeger, among other accomplishments.

    This has nothing and everything to do with Charles Barkley, **the
    Einstein of** *the Houston Rockets*, who was not enraptured with a
    man at a bar in Orlando, Fla., the other night and, by witnesses'
    account, picked him up and threw him like a football through a

    Syd Straw has long been **the Dorothy Parker of** *the downtown club

    it was dubbed ''Dole's Beach.''

    ([1997/11/14/0972790](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/14/movies/pop-and-jazz-guide-115479.html))
    Tribe 8 is a self-proclaimed lesbian punk band whose lead singer
    Lynn Breedlove is **the Iggy Pop of** *the 1990's*: a shocking,
    brilliant performer in leather pants and no shirt, the definition of
    transgressive freedom.

    ([1997/11/18/0973929](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/18/arts/television-review-the-glasses-the-hair-the-angst.html))
    This exceptionally funny and clever episode of the series, about an
    intellectual named Maya (Laura San Giacomo) who works for her
    philistine father (George Segal) at a fashion magazine called Blush,
    is shaped as an ''Annie Hall'' parody and features a character who
    looks, talks and acts like **the Woody Allen of** *Maya's dreams*.

    ([1997/11/23/0975066](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/23/nyregion/dining-out-the-cuisine-makes-a-royal-statement.html))

    Sunday morning merchant may have a right to her hauteur.

    ([1997/11/26/0975833](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/26/dining/food-stuff.html))
    Though she has some valuable old cookbooks -- including those by
    Isabella Beeton and Mrs. H. W. Beecher, **the Julia Childs of** *the
    mid-19th century* -- Ms. Slotnick's books are mainly 20th-century
    American volumes that are now out of print.

    Since then, in almost every season, 14 of them in all, everyone has
    wondered, is this the year the A.F.C., **the Susan Lucci of**
    *football*, ends the streak?

    ([1997/12/08/0978823](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/08/business/radio-s-renegade.html))
    But if Mr. Dunifer's advocates see him as a free-speech crusader and
    **the Johnny Appleseed of** *low-power radio*, the F.C.C., the legal
    guardian of the common property of the airwaves, sees him as a radio
    ''pirate'' who is breaking the law, disrupting licensed broadcasters
    and posing a threat to public safety.
122. [Ralph Lauren](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q296647)

    IT is probably being way too glib to describe hepatitis B as **the
    Rodney Dangerfield of** *major infectious diseases*.
124. [William Shakespeare](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q692)
    ([1997/12/14/0980053](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/14/travel/dostoyevsky-s-city-on-the-neva.html))
    Viscount Melchoir de Vogue, a Frenchman, agreed, and regarded
    Dostoyevsky as its warden: ''He is **the Shakespeare of** *the
    lunatic asylum*.''

    ([1997/12/14/0980084](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/14/magazine/l-outside-in-526304.html))
    Shimon Peres had already failed three times in national elections
    and, given his age and lifetime in politics, was perceived as **the
    Bob Dole of** *Israeli politics*.
126. [Annie Oakley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q230935)
    ([1997/12/24/0982708](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/24/movies/film-review-smarter-than-she-is-hah.html))
    Running nearly as long as ''Pulp Fiction'' even though its ambitions
    are more familiar and small, ''Jackie Brown'' has the makings of
    another, chattier ''Get Shorty'' with an added homage to Pam Grier,
    **the Annie Oakley of** *1970's blaxploitation*.
127. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1997/12/26/0983138](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/26/sports/tennis-breakfast-champions-4.96-hon-pete-sampras-wild-all-right-like-maple-syrup.html))
    No one wants his autograph, and no one asks him if he thinks of
    himself as **the Michael Jordan of** *tennis*, a question that makes
    Sampras lose his appetite wherever and whenever it is asked.

    Called **the Henry Ford of** *housing*, he spurned unions to
    organize an army of 15,000 workers into dozens of specialized crews,
    including one to apply red paint and another, white.
129. [Studs Terkel](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q529276)
    ([1997/12/31/0984216](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/31/world/danilo-dolci-vivid-voice-of-sicily-s-poor-dies-at-73.html))
    A prolific writer of prose and poetry, he has also been called by
    literary critics **the Studs Terkel of** *Sicily*, although Mr.
    Dolci was the first of the two to chronicle the lives of workers.

1998
----

1.  [Dwight D. Eisenhower](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9916)
    ([1998/01/01/0984416](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/01/opinion/the-year-of-living-smugly.html))
    He reacted angrily to charges that he had become a caretaker chief
    executive, coasting toward retirement on a surging economy, **the
    Dwight Eisenhower of** *the baby boomers*.
2.  [Annie Oakley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q230935)
    ([1998/01/02/0984556](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/02/movies/movie-guide.html)) Ms.
    Grier, **the Annie Oakley of** *1970's blaxploitation films*, makes
    a game comeback even if she struggles with the story's
    ensemble loafing.
3.  [Greta Garbo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5443)
    ([1998/01/03/0984733](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/03/sports/helen-wills-moody-dominant-champion-who-won-8-wimbledon-titles-dies-at-92.html))
    Reclusive by nature and dubbed **the Garbo of** *the tennis tour* by
    Alice Marble, one of the many opponents who felt ignored by her,
    Wills nonetheless lived a most public and, at times,
    storybook existence.
4.  [Napoleon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q517)
    ([1998/01/05/0985423](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/05/theater/this-week.html))
    Sherlock Holmes turns 144 tomorrow, but he and **the Napoleon of**
    *crime* are still at it.
5.  [Ruth Messinger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4291304)
    ([1998/01/06/0985708](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/06/nyregion/ferraro-enters-battle-to-take-d-amato-seat.html))
    ''She's **the Ruth Messinger of** *1998*,'' Mr. Mahoney said,
    referring to the Democrat who lost to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani
    this year.
6.  [Madonna](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1744)
    ([1998/01/07/0985825](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/07/books/arts-abroad-living-with-a-shortage-of-everything-but-desire.html))
    Alejandro Armengol, a critic for El Nuevo Herald, a Miami newspaper,
    dismissed Ms. Valdes last year as ''**the Madonna of** *Cuban
    literature*, with an equal capacity to transform self-assurance and
    the grotesque into spectacle, to show vulgarity and eroticism
    stripped of any mystery.''
7.  [Samuel French](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7411423)
    ([1998/01/11/0987037](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/11/nyregion/theater-review-passing-the-clues-along-with-the-salt.html))
    Referring to the New York rights and royalties agency, he added,
    ''I'm **the Samuel French of** *interactive theater*.''
8.  [Ronald Reagan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9960)
    ([1998/01/20/0989011](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/20/world/netanyahu-in-washington-courts-conservatives.html)) Mr.
    Falwell referred to Mr. Netanyahu as ''**the Ronald Reagan of**
    *Israel*.''
9.  [Curt Flood](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5195372)
    ([1998/01/22/0989491](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/22/nyregion/public-lives-sure-footed-in-the-slippery-world-of-rock.html))
    But Jack Newfield, who has written several New York Post columns
    lamenting the industry's neglect of Mr. Price, called him **the Curt
    Flood of** *rock-and-roll*, the rebel who showed a generation of
    musicians how to stand up for themselves.
10. [Lance Ito](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6483431)
    ([1998/01/24/0989958](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/24/opinion/journal-all-monica-all-the-time.html))
    Given Kenneth Starr's record as **the Lance Ito of** *prosecutors*
    -- he's already spent three years-plus on Whitewater -- our new
    national soap opera could easily supply us with entertainment for as
    long as O. J. did.
11. [Magic Johnson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q134183)
    ([1998/01/28/0991077](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/28/sports/sports-of-the-times-hamilton-and-lopez-didn-t-quit.html))
    Lopez came to St. John's as the great Dominican hope from Rice High,
    maybe **the Magic Johnson of** *Manhattan*, and Hamilton came from
    Sewanhaka High in Nassau County, the 6-foot-11-inch sidekick for a
    potential romp to the Final Four.
12. [Garth Brooks](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q216288)
    ([1998/01/29/0991260](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/29/books/making-books-now-grisham-by-e-mail.html))
    But Grisham is **the Garth Brooks of** *popular literature*.
13. [Napoleon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q517)
    ([1998/02/01/0991925](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/01/nyregion/dining-out-a-warm-oasis-with-well-turned-food.html))
    But skip the small, nothing-special oysters in Creole butter and
    **the Napoleon of** *portobello mushrooms*, grilled vegetables and
    goat cheese made too sour by an overdose of balsamic vinegar.
14. [Wally Pipp](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7963465)
    ([1998/02/02/0992419](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/02/arts/bob-russell-entertainer-is-dead-at-90.html))
    But then, by some reckonings, Mr. Russell was **the Wally Pipp of**
    *show business*.
15. [George Orwell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3335)
    ([1998/02/04/0992795](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/04/arts/on-the-trail-of-missing-antecedents-and-meaning.html))
    She has been called **the Orwell of** *copy editors*, the Kasparov
    of syntax.
16. [Garry Kasparov](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q28614)
    ([1998/02/04/0992795](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/04/arts/on-the-trail-of-missing-antecedents-and-meaning.html))
    She has been called the Orwell of copy editors, **the Kasparov of**
    *syntax*.
17. [Genghis Khan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q720)
    ([1998/02/05/0993081](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/05/business/legends-of-ore-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-venerable-name-in-south-african-mining.html))
    His name has a powerful resonance: Mzilikazi, the most fearsome
    general of the Zulu King Shaka, **the Genghis Khan of** *Africa*,
    who rebelled and fled, cutting a swath of destruction across
    southern Africa in the 1820's and 1830's.
18. [Anselm Kiefer](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170344)
    ([1998/02/06/0993369](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/06/arts/art-in-review-447790.html))
    William Kentridge, one of the standouts at Documenta X in Kassel,
    Germany, last summer, may be **the Anselm Kiefer of** *South
    Africa*.
19. [Martha Stewart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234606)
    ([1998/02/08/0993756](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/08/nyregion/about-long-island-all-natural-all-the-time-except-for.html))
    Perhaps **the Martha Stewart of** *B-6 and goldenseal root*.
20. [Auguste Rodin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30755)
    ([1998/02/15/0995540](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/15/nyregion/art-review-putting-together-pieces-of-a-career-cut-short.html)) Mr.
    Colavita certainly surmounted that bias (although he could also
    indulge in crafts) to the degree that his teaching colleague, the
    painter Mel Leipzig, could with some aptness refer to him in an
    interview in The Trenton Times last month as ''**the Rodin of** *New
    Jersey*.''
21. [Wyatt Earp](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q44616)
    ([1998/02/15/0995712](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/15/sports/sports-of-the-times-the-ballad-of-men-searching-for-gold.html))
    In second place, the irrepressible Canadian and skating to his own
    exotic tune, Elvis Stojko, perhaps **the Wyatt Earp of** *the
    crowd*.
22. [Rosa Parks](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41921)
    ([1998/02/16/0995903](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/16/nyregion/man-who-set-off-firecrackers-is-called-hero.html))
    Some people have gone so far as to declare him **the Rosa Parks of**
    *Chinatown*.
23. [Liberace](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q347528)
    ([1998/02/17/0996011](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/17/style/john-bartlett-on-the-fringe-no-more.html))
    That distinction goes back at least 20 years to Don Robbie, who
    besides playing a pivotal role in Pierre Cardin's business in the
    United States, was something of **the Liberace of** *the fashion
    industry*, keeping a pink bed at the center of his showroom.
24. [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([1998/02/17/0996027](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/17/business/market-place-no-sales-but-watch-the-stock-soar.html)) Mr.
    Peizer developed his high profile in his 20's, when he became a
    salesman at the Beverly Hills office of Drexel Burnham Lambert,
    where he sat next to the man he describes as **the Babe Ruth of**
    *the bond business*.
25. [Jack Nicholson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q39792)
    ([1998/02/22/0997094](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/22/arts/classical-music-making-maestros-for-the-world.html))
    Yet even some of his countrymen refer to him, with amused reverence,
    as **the Jack Nicholson of** *Scandinavia*.
26. [Little Richard](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q82222)
    ([1998/02/22/0997273](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/22/nyregion/neighborhood-report-flatiron-buzz-a-big-night-for-rap-but-not-all-stars-shone.html))
    ''I've been dissed, we've been dissed,'' said Mr. Herc, who calls
    himself ''**the Little Richard of** *the hip-hop business*.''
27. [Vince Lombardi](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q553321)
    ([1998/02/22/0997356](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/22/sports/xviii-winter-games-ice-hockey-enterprising-russian-team-hasn-t-forgotten-world.html))
    He is Viktor Tikhonov, **the Vince Lombardi of** *hockey in the
    former Soviet Union*.
28. [Will Rogers](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q457840)
    ([1998/02/25/0997888](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/25/business/shake-up-health-giant-new-chief-true-believer-hopes-salvage-reputation.html))
    Oxford has ''brought in **the Will Rogers of** *family
    physicians*,'' said Mr. Cain, who said Dr. Payson had never met a
    doctor he did not like.
29. [Wayne Gretzky](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q209518)
    ([1998/03/02/0999298](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/02/sports/hockey-hockey-s-improvising-gold-glove-hasek-has-redefined-way-play-goalie-but.html))
    ''I call him **the Wayne Gretzky of** *his position*,''
    Muckler said.
30. [Jesus Christ](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q302)
    ([1998/03/04/0999734](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/04/us/taiwanese-group-prepares-to-meet-god-in-texas.html))
    The group spent a few weeks last summer in British Columbia
    searching for a man whom Mr. Chen describes as the ''Jesus of the
    West'' (the boy Chi-Jen Lo is **the Jesus of** *the East*).
31. [Bobby Short](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q888675)
    ([1998/03/08/1000310](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/08/magazine/the-road-crew.html))
    ''; Danny Showers, **the Bobby Short of** *the West*, lounge singer
    at the Westin Tabor Center in Denver ''You learn to read the
    business week like a good book.
32. [John the Baptist](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40662)
    ([1998/03/08/1000313](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/08/magazine/the-new-business-class.html))
    Even Marshall McLuhan, **the John the Baptist of** *the wired
    universe*, remarked, ''You get moving very quickly and you end up in
    the wrong place.''
33. [Kofi Annan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1254)
    ([1998/03/08/1000595](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/08/style/the-night-for-the-american-century-a-party-just-as-grandiose.html))
    It was a task that must have required the diplomacy of **the Kofi
    Annan of** *party planners*.
34. [Will Smith](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40096)
    ([1998/03/12/1001407](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/12/technology/game-theory-the-japanese-embrace-hip-hop-and-parappa-is-born.html))

    ([1998/03/13/1001742](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/13/opinion/the-comparable-tony-blair.html))
    On March 1, Francesco Cossiga, a former Italian president, conferred
    the title of ''**the Tony Blair of** *the right*'' on Gianfranco
    Fini, who is now reveling in his role as a low-fat Fascist.

    To manage his operations, Khedoury Zilkha, by then known as **the
    Rothschild of** *the Middle East*, deployed his four sons around the
    world, with Selim drawing Paris, then London.
37. [Billy Graham](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213550)
    ([1998/03/21/1003664](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/21/business/jheri-redding-is-dead-at-91-a-hair-products-entrepreneur.html))

    ([1998/03/24/1004596](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/24/world/into-africa.html))
    Africa is **the Rodney Dangerfield of** *continents*; the world
    seems to pay it scant heed and shows it less respect.
39. [Menachem Begin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q130873)
    ([1998/03/28/1005376](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/28/opinion/foreign-affairs-the-odds-against-history.html))

    What are the odds that Mr. Zhu will turn out to be **the Mikhail

    nothing of the kind?

    ''She was dressed as millions of women would like to be dressed,''
    the American journalist Fleur Cowles wrote, after a 1950 meeting
    with the 31-year-old Maria Eva Duarte de Peron, whose sartorial
    distinction and national popularity made her **the Jacqueline
    Kennedy of** *South America*.
44. [Sol Hurok](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4535129)

    ([1998/04/19/1010622](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/19/books/chief-of-a-vanishing-empire.html))
    To his British allies of the time he was ''**the Wellington of**
    *the Indians*,'' while his most formidable adversary, William Henry
    Harrison, the future President of the United States, called him
    ''one of those uncommon geniuses which spring up occasionally to
    produce revolutions and overturn the established order of things,''
    adding, ''If it were not for the vicinity of the United States, he
    would, perhaps, be the founder of an empire that would rival in
    glory that of Mexico or Peru.''

    ([1998/04/19/1010667](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/19/magazine/the-big-city-civil-obedience.html))
    Mockus might be described as **the Rudy Giuliani of** *Bogota,

    The Simpsons and their friends, with the possible exception of the
    precocious Lisa, a second grader with the potential to be **the

    incoherent rage and improperly filled-out paperwork.

    The movement has always had to have a Bull Connor, and Giuliani may
    become **the Bull Connor of** *the new millennium*.''

    ([1998/09/10/1045162](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/10/technology/user-s-guide-confronting-truths-about-file-storage.html))

    Where else could you find Czarina Oksana Borzoi Diva Dog Needlenose
    of MuffinTush, **the Ann Landers of** *canine expatriate nobility*,
    who answers questions that borzois and other dogs instruct their
    human servants to E-mail to her?

    Fortunately, being **the Buster Keaton of** *martial arts*, he makes
    a doleful expression and comedic physical grace take the place of
    small talk.
114. [Jackson Pollock](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37571)
    ([1998/09/18/1047304](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/18/arts/art-review-walker-evans-found-the-poetry-in-life-s-unvarnished-details.html))

    Sexton, who described himself as ''**the P. T. Barnum of** *legal
    education*,'' said the forum, which was called Strengthening
    Democracy in the Global Economy, was meant to showcase what the
    school calls its global law school initiative.

    Stern, a traditionalist, has himself had a lifelong love affair with
    molding, and there are complaints at Yale that installing **the
    Ralph Lauren of** *architecture* -- the view of his critics -- sends
    the wrong message about the direction of the school.
117. [Michelangelo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5592)
    ([1998/09/25/1049076](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/25/movies/film-festival-review-jostling-and-stumbling-toward-a-fateful-15-minutes.html))

    Rocky as he was at first, Gehrig, whose fielding skills were still
    notoriously deficient when he joined the Yankees organization in
    1923, proved such a quick study and had such acute eyesight that by
    the time Commerce won the New York City public school championship
    in 1920 he was already being called **the Babe Ruth of** *high
    school baseball in New York*.
119. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1998/09/27/1049680](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/27/sports/triathlon-ironman-triathlon-grows-it-s-now-20-and-still-bragging.html))
    and is now a sportscaster, and David Bailey, **the Michael Jordan
    of** *motocross racing in the 1980's* who became paralyzed in a
    racing accident and will compete in a wheelchair along part of
    the course.
120. [Noël Coward](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q298388)

    He has been described as **the Noel Coward of** *modern dance*, for
    works like ''Town and Country'' (contrasting views of the
    class system) and ''The Percys of Fitzrovia'' (a send-up of the
    bohemian Bloomsbury group).
121. [Elvis Presley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q303)

    And that was fine with the Met's trustees, who looked upon
    photography, more or less, as **the Elvis of** *the visual arts*:
    fast, slick and indecently young, with a history going back only as
    far as 1839.
122. [Nelson Bunker Hunt](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q711333)
    ([1998/10/04/1051244](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/04/books/arts-architecture-from-the-breakfast-of-champions-cerealectibles.html))

    Mass., and soon he was crisscrossing the country, becoming **the
    Nelson Bunker Hunt of** *lunch box collectors*.
123. [Jackie Robinson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q221048)
    ([1998/10/06/1051936](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/06/us/los-angeles-honors-legacy-of-tom-bradley.html)) Mr.

    service*.''
124. [Cecil B. DeMille](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q72267)

    After watching the 45-minute hearing, a bent knuckle pressed against
    his lips, Mr. Edwards, who has not been charged in the case,
    announced to reporters in a descending elevator that his longtime
    friend had become ''**the Linda Tripp of** *Louisiana*.''
126. [Gian Lorenzo Bernini](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q160538)
    ([1998/10/08/1052345](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/08/garden/at-home-with-jon-jerde-the-global-village-goes-pop-baroque.html))

    Meetings are **the Rodney Dangerfield of** *the business world*:
    While many good ideas come from them, meetings get no respect.
128. [Linda Tripp](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3241381)

    Should that happen, Edwards's lawyers are very likely to be hard on
    the man Edwards has called ''**the Linda Tripp of** *Louisiana*.''
129. [Larry Bird](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q190152)

    ([1998/10/14/1053952](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/14/opinion/liberties-last-tango-in-dc.html))
    His Presidency is already ruined -- he is **the Andrew Johnson of**
    *the counterculture* -- and he can be penalized in any of a number
    of ways that will not rend the nation.
131. [Giorgio Armani](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q157054)
    ([1998/10/15/1054141](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/15/arts/art-review-the-high-art-of-dressing-for-battle.html))

    ([1998/10/25/1056575](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/25/books/crime-389692.html))
    This frees up Jonathan to sprinkle his acidic wit on art experts and
    thieves like Dan Menzies (''**the Al Capone of** *restoration*''),
    who has been engaged by the monastery to apply his savage artistry
    to its dubious Caravaggio.
135. [Cal Ripken](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q731168)
    ([1998/10/27/1057308](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/27/sports/1998-new-york-marathon-on-the-run-every-day-for-more-than-23-years.html))

    His advisers hope he could be a Vice-Presidential candidate or a
    Cabinet secretary in a Republican administration, and Mr. Rowland
    was tickled to see himself referred to as ''**the George W. Bush
    of** *the North*'' in a recent article in U.S. News & World Report.

    ([1998/11/01/1058886](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/01/tv/cover-story-broadway-s-cats-restaged-for-eternity-we-thought-they-were-kidding.html))
    ''I was given a different lyric every night for the first 10
    previews,'' Ms. Paige said, reminiscing on the telephone from London
    recently about those bygone days before ''Cats'' had become
    ''Cats,'' the long-runner in the West End and the longest-running
    production in Broadway history, **the Mark McGwire of** *the modern
    musical*.
141. [Julia Child](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q214477)

    ([1998/11/05/1059728](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/05/opinion/the-full-nelson-in-minnesota.html))
    For starters, The Body's bad-guy persona, which included wearing
    feather boas and pink tights, seemed a blatant rip-off of the
    immortal Gorgeous George, **the Liberace of** *pro wrestling in the
    1950's*.
144. [Lauren Bacall](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q104000)

    The exhibitions featured the trick horses of the charro champion
    Jerry Diaz, who surrounds himself and his palomino with a spinning
    lariat, as well as a balletic dressage demonstration by the
    four-time United States Olympian Robert Dover and Anky van Grunsven
    of the Netherlands, whose bay horse, Bonfire, is **the Michael
    Jordan of** *this sport*.

    ([1998/11/07/1060087](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/07/opinion/journal-dewey-defeats-truman.html))
    By contrast, Mr. Clinton ''came in here and he trashed the place,''
    observes David Broder, who is so ritualistically called the
    fair-minded ''Dean'' of Washington journalists that you might say he
    is **the Henry Hyde of** *punditry*.
147. [Woody Allen](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q25089)

    You might call Mr. Elbaz, 37, **the Woody Allen of** *fashion*, so

    ([1998/11/13/1061675](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/13/movies/pop-guide.html))
    Tribe 8 is a self-proclaimed lesbian punk band whose lead singer,
    Lynn Breedlove, is **the Iggy Pop of** *the 1990's*: a shocking,
    brilliant performer in leather pants and no shirt, the definition of
    transgressive freedom.Tonight at 8; tickets are \$8 (Powers).
151. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)

    *post-independence New Delhi*, is out every night ministering to the
    newly elected politicos streaming in from the provinces -- teaching
    them to use the right fork at the French Ambassador's dinner and
    sometimes romancing them afterward.
164. [Michelangelo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5592)
    ([1998/12/06/1067343](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/06/books/the-man-who-helped-make-rome-eternal.html))
    Almost from his birth in 1598, Gianlorenzo Bernini was groomed to be
    **the Michelangelo of** *his age*.

    ([1998/12/06/1067344](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/06/books/cooking.html))
    This pared-down, workmanlike approach to Italian food -- viewers of
    Batali's shows on the Food Network, ''Molto Mario'' and
    ''Mediterranean Mario,'' know him as **the Bob Vila of** *chefs* --
    makes ''Simple Italian Food'' immensely appealing and
    endlessly useful.
166. [Adam Tihany](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2905182)
    ([1998/12/13/1069441](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/13/nyregion/new-yorkers-co-three-kerrymen-know-how-to-get-a-pub-right.html))
    The traditional pub decor of Tir Na Nog, where every furnishing,
    down to the last brick (straight from Belfast) has been imported
    from the Irish isle, is the work of Lorri Sinclair and of Philip
    Donaghy, who might be called **the Adam Tihany of** *Ireland*, since
    he has designed 12 bars in Dublin and elsewhere.
167. [Lawrence Taylor](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q963129)
    ([1998/12/25/1072352](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/25/sports/pro-football-having-a-deep-impact-on-vikings-success.html))
    After only 15 career games, Moss is developing into **the Lawrence
    Taylor of** *offense*.
168. [Chuck Yeager](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q271939)
    ([1998/12/27/1072570](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/27/books/southern-exposure.html))
    Nansen was **the Chuck Yeager of** *polar exploration*.

    ([1998/12/27/1072824](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/27/sports/1998-in-review-champions-all-and-all-in-anonymity.html))
    Here's to Brian Foster, **the Michael Jordan of** *BMX racing*,
    whose bike-riding skills earn him more than \$100,000 per year.
170. [Brian Wilson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q313013)
    ([1998/12/31/1073562](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/31/movies/critic-s-notebook-beyond-the-meteors-another-riskier-98.html))
    The enrapturing beauty and peculiar naivete of ''The Thin Red Line''
    heightened the impression of Terrence Malick as **the Brian Wilson
    of** *the film world*.

1999
----

1.  [Buster Keaton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103949)
    ([1999/01/03/1074179](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/03/arts/dance-performing-directing-and-paying-the-bills.html))
    Critics and contemporaries have called Mr. Curran **the Buster
    Keaton of** *dance*, because his style suggests a sad
    comedic reverie.
2.  [Mike Tyson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q79031)
    ([1999/01/03/1074221](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/03/business/business-to-the-beat-of-the-bleat-ranchers-aim-to-satisfy-the-demand-for-goat.html))
    ''We aim to be **the Tyson of** *goats*,'' said Stuart Weiss,
    a co-owner.

    ([1999/01/03/1074259](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/03/nyregion/neighborhood-report-new-york-up-close-james-herriot-west-18th-st-treats-last-pet.html))
    ''He was **the James Herriot of** *New York City*,'' said a client,
    Michele Gover, referring to the British country veterinarian who
    wrote such best sellers as ''All Creatures Great and Small.''
4.  [Hillary Clinton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6294)
    ([1999/01/08/1075423](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/08/arts/antiques-much-more-than-meets-the-eye.html))
    Elisa was **the Hillary Clinton of** *her day*: intelligent,
    educated and strong willed.
5.  [Fred Astaire](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q100937)
    ([1999/01/10/1075865](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/10/arts/television-radio-the-power-of-personality-how-divine.html))
    HE was **the Fred Astaire of** *repartee*, a man whose tailoring
    seemed to precede his birth.
6.  [Neil Armstrong](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1615)
    ([1999/01/10/1075868](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/10/movies/one-one-of-a-kind-comic-impersonating-another.html))
    I think of him as **the Neil Armstrong of** *comedy*.
7.  [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([1999/01/10/1075993](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/10/nyregion/new-yorkers-co-radio-pirates-drop-anchor-together.html))
    ''If it works it will go down as **the Johnny Appleseed of**
    *radio*.''
8.  [Robert Moses](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1111386)
    ([1999/01/10/1076147](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/10/nyregion/leon-m-goldstein-dies-at-66-led-a-city-university-college.html))
    ''He was **the Robert Moses of** *CUNY*,'' said Jay Hershenson,
    CUNY's vice chancellor for university relations.
9.  [Katharine Graham](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q435203)
    ([1999/01/11/1076310](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/11/business/media-the-kay-graham-of-japan-s-media-industry.html))

    industry*.
10. [Mark Spitz](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q180748)
    ([1999/01/12/1076537](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/12/opinion/foreign-affairs-a-dangerous-peace.html))
    Bibi is **the Mark Spitz of** *Israeli politics* -- no Israeli
    leader has ever crisscrossed the Rubicon faster or more often.
11. [Édith Piaf](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1631)
    ([1999/01/14/1077023](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/14/arts/the-pop-life-treats-for-off-the-menu-tastes.html))
    Call her **the Edith Piaf of** *Nafta*, this American-born,
    Spanish-speaking resident of Montreal is thoroughly modern in her
    syncretic approach to pop, and classic in her florid,
    imperious singing.
12. [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([1999/01/17/1077956](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/17/weekinreview/ideas-trends-they-re-sort-of-like-mike.html))
    The last time he retired, to play baseball, the Chicago Bulls'
    owner, Jerry Reinsdorf, called him **the Babe Ruth of**
    *basketball*.
13. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1999/01/17/1077956](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/17/weekinreview/ideas-trends-they-re-sort-of-like-mike.html))

    ([1999/01/17/1077956](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/17/weekinreview/ideas-trends-they-re-sort-of-like-mike.html))
    Terje Haakenson, a Norwegian, executes moves on a snowboard that
    nobody had ever seen before, so he's dubbed **the Michael Jordan
    of** *snowboarding* -- in every interview and article on him.
15. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1999/01/17/1077956](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/17/weekinreview/ideas-trends-they-re-sort-of-like-mike.html))

16. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1999/01/17/1077956](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/17/weekinreview/ideas-trends-they-re-sort-of-like-mike.html))
    To his publicist, that makes him **the Michael Jordan of** *Mexico*.
17. [George Foreman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213919)
    ([1999/01/20/1078755](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/20/sports/plus-tennis-hall-of-fame-mcenroe-joins-mcgregor-on-list.html))
    My stated goal is to be **the George Foreman of** *tennis*.
18. [Vanna White](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q442202)
    ([1999/01/21/1078893](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/21/nyregion/the-name-behind-those-ping-pong-balls.html))
    But it is Ms. Vega, 43, who has become **the Vanna White of** *the
    lottery drawings*, invited to more charity events and panel
    discussions and onto the Oprah Winfrey show for a makeover.
19. [Buster Keaton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103949)
    ([1999/01/22/1079076](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/22/movies/new-video-releases-971545.html))
    It's fortunate that Jackie Chan is **the Buster Keaton of** *martial
    arts films* because Chris Tucker, his partner in Brett Ratner's
    comedic action film, talks many times too much for both of them.
20. [Robert Ryman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q640936)
    ([1999/01/22/1079251](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/22/arts/art-in-review-987760.html))
    Susanna Coffey could be called **the Robert Ryman of**
    *self-portraiture*.
21. [Wyatt Earp](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q44616)
    ([1999/01/23/1079361](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/23/us/a-boston-firebrand-alienates-his-allies-even-as-he-saves-whales.html))
    That's why they call me **the Wyatt Earp of** *whales*, because I'm
    just saying, 'Let's obey the law.'
22. [Bob Costas](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2458861)
    ([1999/01/24/1079816](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/24/magazine/wayward-intellectual-finds-god.html))
    A prominent journalist is ''**the Bob Costas of** *literary
    criticism*, a fan.''
23. [Larry Flynt](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223839)
    ([1999/01/24/1079942](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/24/nyregion/art-review-decadence-from-the-turn-of-another-century.html))
    In 1896 he began to illustrate literary classics for the publisher
    Leonard Smithers, whom Mr. Skemer describes as ''**the Larry Flynt
    of** *his day*,'' meaning his intentions were wider than merely
    purveying pornography; he wanted to challenge Victorian
    social standards.
24. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1999/01/24/1080017](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/24/sports/backtalk-good-mike-bad-mike-and-the-anti-mike.html))
    If you think that Mike will live forever, remember the role Johnny
    Carson played in the national culture (he was **the Michael Jordan
    of** *late-night TV*) and the enormous coverage of his retirement
    and his replacements.
25. [Joseph Cornell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q694774)
    ([1999/02/01/1081906](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/01/arts/frederick-sommer-93-maker-of-inventive-surreal-images.html))
    Variously described as a gadfly, an eccentric, a photographer's
    photographer and **the Joseph Cornell of** *photography*, Mr. Sommer
    worked in relative isolation in Arizona for more than a half-century
    and until the last several years was the medium's best-kept secret.
26. [Meryl Streep](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q873)
    ([1999/02/07/1083167](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/07/movies/film-second-fiddles-front-and-center.html))
    For a quintessential supporting player like Joan Allen, who has
    become **the Meryl Streep of** *that category*, she seems primed for
    her third supporting nomination as the 50's sitcom wife
    in ''Pleasantville.
27. [Betsy Ross](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234952)
    ([1999/02/07/1083390](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/07/weekinreview/the-world-ruling-class-building-modernity-on-desert-mirages.html))
    But he is not remembered as **the Betsy Ross of** *Arabia*.
28. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([1999/02/14/1084883](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/14/magazine/the-disciples-of-discipline.html))
    His practice boarded up, the 51-year-old Rosemond wanders the
    country eight months of the year, **the Johnny Appleseed of**
    *discipline*, putting on nearly 250 shows annually.
29. [Donald Trump](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686)
    ([1999/02/18/1086058](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/18/us/behind-the-curtains-of-boston-s-best-neighborhood-a-new-elite.html))
    And the strong sense of history prompts obvious parallels: Karen
    Cord Taylor, editor and publisher of The Beacon Hill Times, pointed
    out that Charles Bulfinch, the famed architect and developer whose
    gems, like the State House, crown Beacon Hill, was something like
    **the Donald J. Trump of** *his day*.
30. [Dan Biederman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5213152)
    ([1999/02/20/1086460](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/20/nyregion/improvements-small-scale-brooklyn-bid-makes-strides-despite-its-modest-budget.html))
    It is this kind of grandiose talk that makes some people kid Mr.
    Russo about trying to be **the Dan Biederman of** *Brooklyn* -- a
    tongue-in-cheek comparison to the Manhattan BID president who got on
    the wrong side of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for wielding too
    much power.
31. [P. T. Barnum](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766)
    ([1999/02/23/1087326](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/23/us/with-black-support-daley-seems-sure-of-re-election.html))
    He called the highly praised head of the city school system, Paul
    Vallas, a ''**the P. T. Barnum of** *education*'' and vowed to
    dismiss him if elected.
32. [Andy Warhol](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5603)
    ([1999/03/14/1092103](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/14/travel/fresh-perspectives-on-past-and-present-prague.html))
    Alfons Mucha was **the Andy Warhol of** *his era*, a decorative
    artist who defined a style -- Art Nouveau -- and became a
    media star.
33. [Frédéric Chopin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1268)
    ([1999/03/14/1092125](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/14/travel/europe-99-festivals-one-big-anniversary-party.html))
    Nevertheless, the Concerto for Piano and Orchestra by Grieg, who was
    once called **the Chopin of** *the North*, opens the festival with
    Francois-Rene Duchable as soloist and Michael Schondwandt conducting
    the Collegium Musicum.
34. [Gertrude Stein](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q188385)
    ([1999/03/14/1092170](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/14/arts/a-12-block-glimmer-of-hope-for-new-york.html))
    Peter Eisenman of New York is **the Gertrude Stein of**
    *contemporary architecture*.
35. [David Wells](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2741630)
    ([1999/03/14/1092457](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/14/sports/a-half-century-in-baseball-and-zimmer-still-breathes-it.html))
    He is still booed in Fenway Park for the outcome of that season,
    many Red Sox faithful forever maintaining that Zimmer should've
    rested his regulars more, should've trusted the maverick left-hander
    Bill Lee -- **the David Wells of** *his time* -- in a crucial game
    against the Yankees.
36. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([1999/03/18/1093288](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/18/us/chronic-heartburn-can-increase-risk-of-esophagus-cancer-study-shows.html))
    The condition has been called **the Rodney Dangerfield of** *modern
    ailments* because most patients never take it seriously enough to
    take it to their doctors' attention and treat themselves with
    over-the-counter antacids, which may not be enough to prevent
    dangerous changes in the cells that line the esophagus.
37. [Dennis Rodman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q201608)
    ([1999/03/21/1094215](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/21/opinion/editorial-observer-is-new-hampshire-ripe-for-governor-whosit.html))
    Still, he seemed extremely pleased by the welcome he received in New
    Hampshire, where he was front-page news in the local papers, one of
    which referred to him as ''**the Dennis Rodman of** *potential
    Republican candidates*.''
38. [John Wooden](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q551032)
    ([1999/03/23/1094568](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/23/sports/running-in-thin-air-drossin-pushes-herself-higher.html))
    Pushing hard is the ethic of Alamosa, a remote mountain city of
    12,000 with a thriving runners colony built around the success of
    Vigil, considered **the John Wooden of** *cross-country running*.
39. [Susan Lucci](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q242936)
    ([1999/03/24/1094796](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/24/nyregion/public-lives.html))
    TOM WOLFE can no longer claim to be **the Susan Lucci of** *the
    American Academy of Arts and Letters*.
40. [Christian Lacroix](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q350844)
    ([1999/03/28/1095605](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/28/magazine/style-malibu-xanadu.html))
    He's **the Christian Lacroix of** *decorating*.''
41. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([1999/03/28/1095607](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/28/magazine/a-manifesto-for-the-fast-world.html))
    America today is **the Michael Jordan of** *geopolitics* -- the
    overwhelmingly dominant system.
42. [Warren Buffett](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q47213)
    ([1999/04/02/1097007](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/02/business/murdoch-said-to-be-in-deal-with-liberty.html))
    One longtime media expert quipped that Mr. Malone saw himself as
    **the Warren Buffett of** *the media industry*, alluding to Mr.
    Buffett's strategy of taking large passive positions in
    other companies.
43. [Madonna](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1744)
    ([1999/04/04/1097313](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/04/nyregion/a-reissued-novel-focuses-on-italian-american-women.html))
    ''It is **the Madonna of** *Italian-American literature* in that it
    shows the transition from the Italian immigrant to American citizen
    like no other book of its genre.''
44. [Dorothy Parker](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q270707)
    ([1999/04/11/1099068](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/11/books/children-s-books-032000.html))
    Cuetara is a talented artist who clearly qualifies as **the Dorothy
    Parker of** *picture book repartee*.
45. [Leonardo da Vinci](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q762)
    ([1999/04/11/1099329](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/11/style/the-leonardo-of-condoms.html)) Dr.
    Reddy's designs for condoms with built-in bulges are an attempt to
    rethink the way condoms work, prompting Adam Glickman, the founder
    of Condomania, a specialty retailer and Internet-based mail-order
    company, to call the taciturn Indian designer ''**the Leonardo da
    Vinci of** *the condom*.''
46. [Mike Tyson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q79031)
    ([1999/04/18/1101096](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/18/nyregion/l-when-a-rooster-makes-himself-at-home-249610.html))
    So maybe the rooster is **the Mike Tyson of** *chickendom*.
47. [Gary Hart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q919448)
    ([1999/04/20/1101635](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/20/us/bradley-takes-early-party-prize-he-goes-one-on-one-with-gore.html)) Mr.
    Gore's advisers dismiss Mr. Bradley as **the Gary Hart of** *2000*.
48. [Paul](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9200)
    ([1999/05/02/1104292](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/02/books/sherlock-holmes-s-maker.html))
    Stashower reports the reactions of crowd and reporters -- the
    mixture of reverence, incredulity and ridicule that had become
    associated in his final years with the writer whom many saw as
    ''**the St. Paul of** *spiritualism*'' and many more as ''a sad and
    deluded old man who had squandered his greatness.''
49. [Steven Spielberg](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8877)
    ([1999/05/02/1104452](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE2D9133DF931A35756C0A96F958260))
    If Wynton Marsalis is **the Steven Spielberg of** *the jazz scene*,
    the alto saxophonist Steve Coleman has a strong claim to being its

    The Massachusetts House Speaker, Thomas (''No tribute or ransom'')
    Finneran, who took the heat for driving the Patriots away, now looks
    like **the Patrick Henry of** *football*, if only because he had the

    bribe.''

    With eye-opening revisionist takes on ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' and
    Tennessee Williams's ''Kingdom of Earth'' and such comparatively
    commercial fare as ''As Bees in Honey Drown,'' this young troupe has

    groups*.

    If Nelson Mandela is **the George Washington of** *this new

    ([1999/06/11/1114314](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/11/movies/pop-review-challenges-and-magic-in-a-reunion-of-a-duo.html))
    Always **the McCartney of** *the group*, Mr. McLennan gracefully
    avoids that more famous tunesmith's weakness for banality by turning
    his sugar sharp without warning, as when a darkening chord
    progression turned the phrase ''I'm gonna make you happy'' into
    a threat.
59. [Ricky Martin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q128799)
    ([1999/06/13/1114740](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/13/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-6-13-99-encounter-playing-with-firearms.html))

    The ubiquitous hedge-fund manager Jim Cramer, **the Timothy Leary

    The lineup is intended to draw crowds from inside and outside Latin

    Flamenco of Spain, as well as Armando Manzanero, the crooning
    balladeer regarded as **the Burt Bacharach of** *Mexico*.

    A model for this blending of formalism and freedom is the work of
    George Balanchine, whom Mr. Wilson calls ''**the Mozart of** *the
    20th century*.''
68. [Rose Kennedy](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q236540)

    in 1999*.

77. [Madonna](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1744)

    ([1999/10/10/1143997](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/10/magazine/the-importance-of-matthew-barney.html))
    People began referring to him as **the Wagner of** *contemporary
    art* because, like Wagner, Barney operated in a mythological
    language that seemed willfully irrational, and he had a plan for a
    cycle of works (the five ''Cremaster'' films) that would take years
    to complete.
106. [Jackie Robinson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q221048)
    ([1999/10/12/1144695](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/12/us/elite-college-s-president-takes-to-the-road-to-attract-the-disadvantaged.html))
    Called **the Jackie Robinson of** *higher education* when she became
    the first black woman to head a top-tier college or university in
    1995, Dr. Simmons has embarked upon what she calls a ''personal
    crusade'' to bring disadvantaged students to her campus and similar
    institutions nationwide.

    The relics of St. Therese of Lisieux, **the Emily Dickinson of**
    *Roman Catholic sainthood*, arrived yesterday at Our Lady of the

    ([1999/10/22/1147181](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/22/movies/film-review-a-scorsese-devil-hunt.html))
    Though his latest film explores one more urban inferno and
    colorfully reaffirms Mr. Scorsese's role as **the Dante of** *the
    Cinema*, creating its air of nocturnal torment took some doing.
110. [Brian Wilson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q313013)
    ([1999/10/24/1147595](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/24/arts/pop-that-s-produced-alone-at-home-gets-personal.html)) Mr.

    ([1999/10/24/1147597](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/24/arts/film-the-fun-and-games-of-living-a-virtual-life.html))
    Such clips as the Beastie Boys's ''Sabotage,'' in which the Beasties
    dress up as cops from a 70's television show, and Weezer's ''Buddy
    Holly,'' in which the band turns up in a ''Happy Days'' episode,
    prompted one fan writing on the movie Web site Ain't It Cool News to
    call him the ''**the Orson Welles of** *music videos*.''
112. [Nat King Cole](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q137042)
    ([1999/10/24/1147790](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/24/style/a-night-out-with-the-buena-vista-social-club-noche-de-la-habana-wherever-they-go.html))
    At 72, the silky-voiced Mr. Ferrer -- dubbed **the Nat King Cole
    of** *Cuba* -- looked boyish in his trademark tan-colored Kangol cap
    and canvas K-Swiss sneakers.
113. [Isaak Babel](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49080)
    ([1999/10/24/1148009](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/24/books/the-18-year-itch.html))
    MORE than a decade has passed since a friend called me to rave about
    the work of one of her graduate students, a recent immigrant from
    China who wrote in English and who was, my friend said, **the Isaac
    Babel of** *the Chinese Army*.
114. [Richard Wagner](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1511)
    ([1999/10/31/1149440](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/31/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-10-31-99-encounter-a-joy-ride-with-ralph-nader.html))
    It is **the Richard Wagner of** *S.U.V.'s*.
115. [Rosa Parks](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41921)
    ([1999/11/04/1150603](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/04/nyregion/the-1999-elections-hempstead-democrat-is-elected-under-voting-method-she-fought.html))
    Dorothy Goosby, a 61-year-old nursing home dietitian and high school
    chemistry teacher, is described by her supporters as ''**the Rosa
    Parks of** *Long Island*'' for her long effort to end the at-large
    system of electing the Town Board, a process she says has kept black
    people off.
116. [Grandma Moses](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q260683)
    ([1999/11/07/1151271](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/07/nyregion/in-person-out-of-leonia-a-first-novel.html))

    joked that at the age of 58 she is ''**the Grandma Moses of** *first
    novelists*.''

    ([1999/11/07/1151463](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/07/weekinreview/the-world-order-in-the-court-a-revolution-is-on-trial.html))
    Not for nothing has Mr. Nouri, 50, been called **the Martin Luther
    of** *Iran*.
118. [Robert Frost](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q168728)
    ([1999/11/12/1152666](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/12/opinion/public-interests-george-w-helmsman.html)) Mr.
    Bush, **the Robert Frost of** *political name recognition*, won the
    first polls easily, and after that things just started snowballing.
119. [Mary Harris Jones](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q107082)
    ([1999/11/14/1153412](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/14/us/the-most-innovative-figure-in-silicon-valley-maybe-this-labor-organizer.html))
    And in a movement where blue jeans are favored, she wears pumps and
    gold bracelets, although her Ann Taylor look has not stopped her
    from earning the nickname **the Mother Jones of** *Silicon Valley*.
120. [John Calvin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37577)
    ([1999/11/15/1153640](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/15/nyregion/political-memo-mayor-s-harsh-style-despite-critics-no-plans-to-change.html))
    As ever, he is the classroom know-it-all, the professional scold,
    **the John Calvin of** *city government*, so much so that
    caricaturists routinely portray him in an apoplectic state.
121. [Adolf Hitler](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q352)
    ([1999/11/28/1156565](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/28/books/blue-period.html))
    No wonder the British trade paper Film Weekly called him ''**the
    Hitler of** *Hollywood*.''
122. [Audrey Hepburn](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q42786)
    ([1999/11/28/1156590](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/28/books/books-in-brief-nonfiction-504319.html))

    *skating*.''
123. [Marcel Proust](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7199)
    ([1999/11/28/1156627](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/28/arts/music-keith-jarrett-meditates-on-mortality.html)) Mr.
    Jarrett, **the Proust of** *jazz*, had chronic fatigue syndrome
    recently, and for a while the Internet was bubbling with rumors of
    his imminent demise that gained credence after he canceled
    several concerts.
124. [Mikhail Gorbachev](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30487)
    ([1999/11/28/1156860](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/28/weekinreview/the-world-a-middle-east-choice-peace-or-democracy.html))

    Profile writers have compared him to Indiana Jones, and quoted
    sympathetic colleagues who called Dr. Plotkin **the Carl Sagan of**
    *the rain forest*.
126. [Philip Johnson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q183528)
    ([1999/12/05/1158279](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/05/books/quicker-than-st-john-the-divine.html))

    ([1999/12/05/1158663](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/05/sports/the-road-to-sydney-olympic-profile-basketball-returning-for-a-last-hurrah.html))
    Or when, during a heated practice, she's trying to outfox youngsters
    like Chamique Holdsclaw, the player she's pegged as the star for the
    new millennium and to whom she's prepared to bequeath her moniker as
    **the Michael Jordan of** *women's ball*.
128. [Jim Morrison](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q44301)
    ([1999/12/09/1159451](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/09/books/arts-abroad-brazil-wizard-makes-books-disappear-from-stores.html))
    Here in his homeland Mr. Coelho first came to attention in the early
    1970's not as a novelist but as a pop music lyricist, writing more
    than 70 songs with the rock star Raul Seixas, described by Mr.
    Coelho as ''**the Jim Morrison of** *Brazil*.''
129. [Bruce Springsteen](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1225)
    ([1999/12/11/1159942](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/11/world/panama-feels-slighted-when-albright-cancels-date-at-canal.html))
    Madeleine Albright is **the Bruce Springsteen of** *foreign
    affairs*.
130. [David Lynch](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2071)
    ([1999/12/12/1160206](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/12/nyregion/folk-music-becomes-presence-to-contend-with.html))
    One of the Island's more iconoclastic performers, James Yarsky
    performs emotionally charged, raging songs in highly theatrical
    stage performances that led one writer too call him **the David
    Lynch of** *folk music*.
131. [Jack Kerouac](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q160534)
    ([1999/12/17/1161636](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/17/movies/hits-live-albums-and-compilations-musical-merry-making-from-raunchy-to-reverent-937720.html)) W.
    Axl Rose is **the Jack Kerouac of** *hard rock*, embodying the myth
    of masculinity in all its beauty and horror.
132. [Britney Spears](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11975)
    ([1999/12/19/1161983](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/19/arts/music-crossing-back-to-good-ol-country.html))
    From the cavalcade of come hither, ''Teen Beats'' photos to the
    completely predictable array of blockbuster classics like ''Crazy,''
    'Your Cheatin' Heart'' and ''Lovesick Blues,'' this album feels like
    an attempt to become **the Britney Spears of** *country*.
133. [Florence Nightingale](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37103)
    ([1999/12/26/1163753](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/26/movies/1999-the-year-in-review-film-a-taste-for-the-eccentric-marginal-and-dangerous.html))
    He sees himself as a humanitarian, **the Florence Nightingale of**
    *Death Row*, the man who took the ouch out of the death penalty.
134. [P. T. Barnum](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766)
    ([1999/12/26/1163871](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/26/style/10-parties-that-shook-the-century.html))
    It was given by her husband of the time, Michael Todd, **the P. T.
    Barnum of** *Hollywood*, and the event arguably ushered in the
    modern Hollywood era.
135. [Donald Trump](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686)
    ([1999/12/27/1164179](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/27/world/london-journal-rounding-up-a-bbc-audience-with-sheep-dogs.html))
    They are people of such retiring natures that when one admits to
    being ''quietly confident'' about the competition, he comes across
    as **the Donald Trump of** *the sheep-dog world*.

    He was **the Tiger Woods of** *his time* -- which is to say, Tiger
    Woods without all the handlers.
2.  [Quentin Tarantino](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3772)
    ([2000/01/02/1165360](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/02/movies/film-a-shakespeare-tale-whose-time-has-come.html))
    Webster was **the Quentin Tarantino of** *his age*, but he didn't
    invent this mixed style of drama.
3.  [Tony Robbins](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q380429)
    ([2000/01/07/1166580](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/07/movies/critic-s-notebook-films-glow-independently.html))
    PLUSES: Tom Cruise as **the Tony Robbins of** *misogynistic sex*, in
    another role in which his phony, too-bright smiles match
    his character.
4.  [Calvin Klein](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q214800)
    ([2000/01/08/1166834](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/08/arts/robert-mcg-thomas-60-chronicler-of-unsung-lives.html))
    Among them were Howard C. Fox, ''the Chicago clothier and sometime
    big-band trumpeter who claimed credit for creating and naming the
    zoot suit with the reet pleat, the reave sleeve, the ripe stripe,
    the stuff cuff and the drape shape that was the stage rage during
    the boogie-woogie rhyme time of the early 1940's,'' and Russell
    Colley, a mechanical engineer who became ''**the Calvin Klein of**
    *space*'' and was known to a generation of astronauts as the
    ''father of the space suit.''
5.  [Henry Ford](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8768)
    ([2000/01/09/1166971](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/09/books/theocracy-in-the-desert.html))
    He can be viewed as **the Henry Ford of** *religion*, with a
    uniquely American knack for enterprise and innovation, or a Jim
    Jones figure from the dark edge of the frontier, ready to take his
    followers off a cliff with him.
6.  [Dave Douglas](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1173180)
    ([2000/01/13/1168186](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/13/arts/the-pop-life-favorite-cd-s-you-nearly-missed.html))
    But there's a resourcefulness here: they use cheap electronics well,
    they mine a lot of feeling from single vamps, and the disciplined,
    versatile cornetist Rob Mazurek may yet become **the Dave Douglas
    of** *the Midwest*.
7.  [Cal Ripken](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q731168)
    ([2000/01/15/1168688](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/15/nyregion/artery-blocked-letterman-has-heart-bypass-surgery.html))
    He's **the Cal Ripken of** *TV*,'' said Mr. Rubenstein, referring to
    the Baltimore Orioles shortstop with the stellar attendance record.
8.  [Dorothea Dix](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q452469)
    ([2000/01/16/1168831](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/16/magazine/the-global-willowbrook.html))
    Guiding the international entourage that chilly fall morning was
    Virginia Gonzalez, **the Dorothea Dix of** *Mexico*, that nation's
    leading advocate for the mentally ill and the country's No.
9.  [Napoleon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q517)
    ([2000/01/19/1169686](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/19/books/the-curious-incident-of-the-sleuth-in-the-meantime.html))
    Conan Doyle persevered in his homicide, inventing **the Napoleon
    of** *crime*, Moriarity, who in ''The Final Problem'' plunges with
    Holmes into the seething waters of Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland.
10. [Liv Tyler](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q168763)
    ([2000/01/21/1170158](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/21/movies/theater-review-where-women-are-merry-and-men-hide-in-closets.html))
    Meanwhile, almost every other man in town wants to marry young Anne
    Page, who is apparently **the Liv Tyler of** *14th-century Windsor*.
11. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([2000/01/23/1170707](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/23/style/literary-pulse-the-whole-kitsch-and-caboodle-439339.html))
    Velvet paintings may be **the Rodney Dangerfield of** *the art
    world*, but Leeteg, who died in 1953, was known as the
    American Gauguin.
12. [John Madden](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q51516)
    ([2000/01/23/1170962](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/23/sports/plus-tv-sports-nascar-waltrip-joins-fox-s-broadcasting-team.html))
    He has the je ne sais quoi that will make him **the John Madden of**
    *racing*, said David Hill, chairman of the Fox Sports
    Television Group.
13. [Tom Hanks](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2263)
    ([2000/01/24/1171146](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/24/movies/american-beauty-wins-3-golden-globe-awards.html))
    ''I am **the Tom Hanks of** *the Golden Globes*.''
14. [Tim McCarver](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7803927)
    ([2000/01/30/1172368](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/30/magazine/jack-nicholson-said-johnny-mac-don-t-ever-change.html))
    He has since established himself as **the Tim McCarver of**
    *tennis*, the undisputed master of his craft.
15. [Dan Marino](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q195367)
    ([2000/01/31/1172834](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/31/business/the-markets-market-place-can-barry-diller-return-to-the-limelight.html))
    Otherwise he runs the risk of being remembered as **the Dan Marino
    of** *the media business*, a great player who was unable to win the
    biggest prize in his chosen game.
16. [Gary Cooper](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q93957)
    ([2000/02/06/1174173](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/06/movies/film-celebrating-la-difference-and-three-objects-of-desire.html)) Ms.
    Bonnaire's greatest physical attribute is her walk, which is brisk
    and androgynously sexy -- she's **the Gary Cooper of** *French
    actresses* -- but what gives her a star's allure is her ability to
    hold her emotions suggestively in reserve.
17. [Stanley Kubrick](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2001)
    ([2000/02/09/1175017](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/09/dining/restaurants-bouley-in-his-klimt-period.html))
    He is **the Stanley Kubrick of** *New York chefs* -- difficult to
    get a read on, by most accounts difficult to deal with, but always
    pointed in a direction that feels as though it will lead straight to
    the next big thing.
18. [Ricky Martin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q128799)
    ([2000/02/13/1176237](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/13/opinion/liberties-king-of-the-hoods.html))
    I used to wonder if the cocky strategist, **the Ricky Martin of**
    *dirty campaigning*, could have pulled President Bush through in
    '92, as he did in '88, when he zestfully turned Willie Horton into
    the bogyman.
19. [Tina Turner](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131814)
    ([2000/02/14/1176472](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/14/sports/dog-show-for-a-champion-hound-a-final-bid-for-glory.html))

    Nobody wants to come off as **the John Rocker of** *hockey* and
    say no.
21. [Walter Lippmann](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q316568)
    ([2000/02/16/1176873](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/16/sports/walter-fletcher-93-is-dead-writer-on-dogs-for-the-times.html))
    I once called him **the Walter Lippmann of** *the hydrant set*, and
    he loved it.''

    Despite their deepest wishes, Gordy Sheer and Chris Thorpe know that

    sports*.

    ''It's very unique, though, to be able to bring **the Michael Jordan
    of** *baseball* home where he was raised in Cincinnati,'' said Jim
    Bowden, the Reds' general manager, who tried to minimize how the

    Conservative Christianity has its own chaste heartthrobs, like
    Joshua Harris, the raffishly cute author of ''I Kissed Dating
    Good-Bye,'' and the singer Rebecca St. James, **the Alanis
    Morissette of** *the W.W.J.D.*

    Junior had no desire to be **the Tony Gwynn of** *Seattle*: a

    trouble of redecorating another house in another baseball town.

    I'll be **the Martha Stewart of** *travelers*, carrying a colorful
    supply of grosgrain ribbons to use as bookmarks: yellow for hotels,
    red for restaurants, green for the historical-cultural section, blue
    and purple for places of interest.
27. [Stevie Nicks](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234691)
    ([2000/03/12/1183115](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/12/arts/making-a-turn-from-fiery-to-meditative.html))
    At 46, Ms. Gillis is a bit like **the Stevie Nicks of** *the dance
    world* -- her name evokes cultlike enthusiasm or groans, but not
    much in between.
28. [Tiger Woods](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q10993)
    ([2000/03/12/1183194](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/12/nyregion/dartboards-draw-a-league-of-enthusiasts.html))

    Between the adored exotic birds, the boxlike space and the
    prevailing aura of innocence and obsession, you may leave this show
    feeling that you have met **the Joseph Cornell of** *the 19th
    century*.
31. [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)

    As early as 1981, critics were debating the value of his elegant
    style and shocking subjects (and referring, in one instance, to an
    earlier photographer as ''**the Robert Mapplethorpe of** *his
    generation*'').
37. [Le Corbusier](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4724)
    ([2000/04/02/1188700](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/02/style/buried-in-clothes-a-closet-cries-out.html))

    So pity the poor 70's, **the Dangerfield of** *decades*, whose early
    years were a carry-over from the ever-popular 60's and whose later
    years were nothing but a prelude to the 80's.
50. [Bill Gates](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5284)
    ([2000/05/01/1196085](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/01/opinion/wired-offices-same-workers.html))
    To date, Willis Haviland Carrier, **the Bill Gates of** *the air

    Bill Gates.

    Robert Halmi Sr., **the Cecil B. DeMille of** *the 27-inch screen*,
    speaks proudly of the inspirational power of that pulpy television
    standby, the mini-series.
55. [Larry Kramer](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q653366)

    But when it came to details like cooperation, she was a disaster,
    **the Larry Kramer of** *the women's movement*.
56. [Mae West](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q202878)
    ([2000/05/12/1198733](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/12/arts/family-fare-a-musical-with-legs.html))
    Designed by Zofia Czechlewska and built by the Teatr Baj of Poland
    and Eli Worden, the elaborate puppets range from Maya, who looks
    like a pugnacious preschooler who has sprouted wings, to Miss
    Loveydear, **the Mae West of** *dragonflies*.
57. [Gaby Hoffmann](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q292381)

    Judy, meanwhile, is dating a tiresome ceramicist played by Peter
    Bogdanovich, who once directed Mr. O'Neal in a frothy romantic
    comedy called ''What's Up, Doc,'' which also starred Barbra
    Streisand, whose name is dropped in passing, as well as Madeline
    Kahn, whom we may one day regard as **the Gaby Hoffmann of** *the
    1970's*.
58. [Madeline Kahn](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234068)

    But as portrayed by Ms. Hoffmann, who may be **the Madeline Kahn
    of** *the Clearasil set*, she's also the source of some of the
    film's best scenes, and the mouthpiece for its funniest lines.
59. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)

    find legitimate challengers.

    ([2000/06/08/1205681](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/08/nyregion/public-lives.html))
    The missing John Lennon piano has been tracked down by SIDNEY BIDDLE
    BARROWS, **the Mayflower Madam of** *the 1980's*.
66. [Martin Amis](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q310176)

    He is a regular contributor to The London Review of Books and has
    been described by The Times of London as ''**the Martin Amis of**
    *British psychoanalysis*,'' for his ''brilliantly amusing and often
    profoundly unsettling'' work.
67. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([2000/06/11/1206269](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/11/books/books-in-brief-nonfiction-550108.html))
    It was only after **the Johnny Appleseed of** *tulips*, a botanist
    named Carolus Clusius, cultivated and cataloged tulip varieties and
    gave them away as gifts that tulipomania really took hold.
68. [Bill Gates](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5284)
    ([2000/06/11/1206294](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/11/travel/the-past-neatly-packaged.html))
    Among those who took notice of the fine location was Benjamin
    Lester, a hard-driving Englishman from Poole, who by the 1780's had
    become **the Bill Gates of** *Newfoundland*.
69. [Lorenzo de' Medici](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q177854)
    ([2000/06/15/1207422](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/15/garden/currents-los-angeles-architecture-heaven-can-t-wait.html))
    How did a pastor become **the Lorenzo de' Medici of** *American
    architecture* -- or, as he put it, ''hooked on architecture of the
    highest league''?
70. [Lord Byron](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5679)

    For her part Ms. Maclean trots out Dennis Hopper, once **the Lord

    Carlos Valdes, known as Patato, could be **the Henny Youngman of**

74. [Joan of Arc](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7226)
    ([2000/06/23/1209653](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/23/arts/art-in-review-the-world-of-charlotte-moorman.html))
    To the composer Edgard Varese she was ''**the Jeanne d'Arc of** *new
    music*.''
75. [Norman Rockwell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q271884)
    ([2000/06/25/1209910](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/25/books/bookend-par-avion.html))
    Saint-Exupery's fall from literary grace begins with ''The Little
    Prince'' in his native country, where he is **the Norman Rockwell
    of** *letters*.
76. [Norman Rockwell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q271884)
    ([2000/06/28/1210928](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/28/arts/bill-papas-73-artist-and-widely-syndicated-political-cartoonist.html))
    The result was ''Papas's America,'' a large-format, limited-edition
    book that evoked scenes of everyday life in a manner that led some
    critics to label him **the Norman Rockwell of** *the 1980's*.
77. [Robin Williams](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q83338)
    ([2000/07/09/1213506](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/09/nyregion/music-a-master-of-parody-weird-like-a-fox.html)) Mr.
    Yankovic is **the Robin Williams of** *rock* -- a manic pop-culture
    sponge who delivers the funny goods.
78. [Howard Hughes](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q189081)
    ([2000/07/09/1213677](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/09/us/bolinas-journal-welcome-to-bolinas-please-keep-on-moving.html))

    But his sudden sweep to national prominence, culminating with his
    decisive election Saturday night as leader of the new Canadian
    Alliance Party, seems vaguely familiar, leading some commentators to

    Right now this presence hovers like a beautiful mist over ''The Arts
    of Hon'ami Koetsu, Japanese Renaissance Master'' at the Philadelphia

    In Western eyes, Mr. Milosevic's undeniable awfulness (politicians
    and diplomats cheerfully called him ''evil'' and ''**the Hitler of**
    *the Balkans*'') justified nearly anything that happened in Kosovo
    -- revenge in the pursuit of liberty was no vice.

    ([2000/11/05/1244777](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/05/magazine/the-know-it-alls.html))
    A quiet 43-year-old computer consultant who has been called ''**the
    Michael Jordan of** *game shows*,'' Pawlowicz
    (pronounced pa-VLO-vich) never lost a match while steamrolling to
    the title of the 1992 ''Jeopardy!''

    If he's **the Tiger Woods of** *juggling*, however, he also reflects
    on how age brings physical diminishment: ''The pure athletic skills

    ([2000/11/26/1250159](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/26/magazine/sense-and-nonsense.html))
    But whereas Disney was primarily an impresario and an empire
    builder, **the Henry Ford of** *fantasy*, Dr. Seuss, who died in
    1991 at the age of 87, conformed to a different American archetype:
    the solitary genius who happens, almost in spite of himself, to be a
    canny entrepreneur.

    More, because he turned Harold Ross, the creator and first editor of
    The New Yorker, into a legend, **the Casey Stengel of** *American

    In this much coarser and more violent, action-heavy story, Mr.
    Deaver presents the villainous Dr. Aaron Matthews, whom a newspaper
    once called ''**the Einstein of** *therapists*'' in the days before
    Hannibal Lecter became his main career influence.

    estate in England, Ms. Ban Breathnach plans to have her hair cut and
    colored at John Frieda, her eyebrows shaped and tweezed by Eliza

    That the stupidity and cartoonlike performances of ''Inbred
    Rednecks'' are deliberate and consistent attests to the creative
    control of Joshua P. Warren, who wrote, directed, produced and

    Drysdale, **the Curt Schilling of** *his day*, shut out the Yankees,

    IN an uncanny boon for the Guggenheim, if you're cynically minded,
    the fortuitous arrival of the two-year-old Norman Rockwell traveling
    exhibition in New York after Sept. 11 gives everybody in town a
    chance to contemplate through altered eyes **the Rembrandt of**
    *Punkin Crick*, as a critic acidly dubbed him years ago.

    In their case, it's from wearing pin-striped shirts bearing the
    numbers of the most storied players in baseball history -- the Babe
    (now known as **the Michael Jordan of** *his time*), Lou Gehrig (if
    he hadn't died under contract, he would still be playing and nobody
    would know Cal Ripken), Joe DiMaggio (less mysteriously dignified
    but more interesting since the recent publication of a sour bio),
    Yogi Berra (in a deserved comeback as the role model for Yoda) and
    Mickey Mantle (redeemed by a gutsy death and Billy Crystal's
    movie, ''61\*'').

    ([2001/11/04/1339880](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/04/magazine/down-mexico-way.html))
    But to devotees of Kahlo -- whom the writer Christopher Goodwin
    describes as ''feminism's premier art icon, **the Sylvia Plath of**
    *the canvas*'' -- the marriage to Rivera has all the ingredients of
    a heroic love story.

    Some at NBC see Mr. Brokaw's ratings edge on the evening news, and
    the fact that more Americans turned to him in that moment of
    national crisis, as evidence that he has become the leading network
    wise man, **the Walter Cronkite of** *his generation*.

    The solo sensitively celebrates the gifts of Steve Humphrey, a
    longtime standout in the fine company and who, in a world that
    valued art more, would probably be **the Michael Jordan of**
    *dance*.

    The songs by Max Martin, **the Phil Spector of** *current

    rewriting previous Spears songs: ''Bombastic Love'' transfers
    ''Oops!

    ''She's **the Martha Stewart of** *the North Fork*,'' Mr. Combs said
    proudly, showing off the raspberry and green shaded dining room that

    and convicted criminals put to work.

    ([2002/01/11/1358421](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/11/arts/art-in-review-five-sculptures.html)) Ms.
    Noland's contribution is unquestionable, but she is becoming even
    more mythic in her absence, something like **the Lee Bontecou of**
    *her generation*.
5.  [Rembrandt](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5598)
    ([2002/01/18/1360201](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/18/arts/art-guide.html))
    Coming after Sept. 11, the show gives everybody in town a chance to
    contemplate through altered eyes **the Rembrandt of** *Punkin
    Crick*, as a critic acidly named him years ago.

    ([2002/01/20/1360733](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/20/movies/film-anime-japanese-cinema-s-second-golden-age.html)) Mr.
    Miyazaki has often been called ''**the Walt Disney of** *Japan*,''
    and the comparison is actually more profound than it may appear.

    Not that the onetime Harvard basketball captain, who stands 6 feet
    8, shows much sign of wear, having never missed a day of work at his
    Bermuda-based Trout Trading Management Company, according to an aide
    who called him ''**the Cal Ripken of** *hedge funds*.''
8.  [Jean Baudrillard](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q182847)

    They repackaged him as a deconstructivist, one of those conceptual
    artists dismantling the language of art only to leave it in
    disarray, **the Jean Baudrillard of** *painting*.
9.  [Narciso Rodriguez](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1775942)

    The guests will feast on mini Maine crab cakes with curry-carrot
    dipping sauce, and will wash it all down with a Galet des Papes
    Vielles Vignes Châteauneuf-du-Pape, a southern Rhone considered so
    hip, so painfully du moment, that oenophiles refer to it as **the
    Narciso Rodriguez of** *wine*.

    On Saturday night a benefit will be held at Town Hall for a man many
    writers consider the superstar of narrators -- **the Russell Crowe
    of** *audiobooks* so to speak -- Frank Muller, who was severely
    injured in a motorcycle accident in November.
12. [John Wayne](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40531)

    ([2002/02/06/1365504](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/06/nyregion/nyc-a-tough-city-surprised-by-affection.html))
    A few weeks after Sept. 11, this column remarked that New York was
    being turned into **the Sally Field of** *cities*, dazed by the
    concern shown by others, much the way that the actress gushed ''You
    like me!''
14. [Frank Sinatra](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40912)
    ([2002/02/10/1366690](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/10/nyregion/james-blackwood-82-dies-major-voice-in-gospel-music.html)) Mr.
    Blackwood, the last surviving founding member of the famed Blackwood
    Brothers gospel quartet, was sometimes called **the Frank Sinatra
    of** *gospel music*, an allusion to his 200 albums, 9 Grammys and
    personal appearances from the Kennedy Center in Washington to the
    First Baptist Church in Moscow.
15. [Lance Armstrong](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2172)

    Blair Sabol, from Villanova, Pa., future fashion guerrilla; a girl
    who would one day be known as **the Abbie Hoffman of** *Seventh

    correct times.

    Half the costumes Dean uses on NITV he keeps in the rear of his car;
    the other half lie crumpled up on the floor behind the cardboard map

24. [David Frost](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q380865)
    ([2002/02/24/1370183](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/24/magazine/the-satellite-subversives.html))

    The Dan Rather of Iran reads the news in front of a map of the

    The Persians who live in Los Angeles describe Meybodi as **the Larry
    King of** *Iran*, but he's more dignified than that, a throwback to
    an earlier age of TV talk shows.
27. [Mel Brooks](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q104266)
    ([2002/02/24/1370183](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/24/magazine/the-satellite-subversives.html))
    Until a year ago, **the Mel Brooks of** *Iran*, which is what Dean
    has become, spent most of his time playing his ridiculous Iranian
    cleric -- he couldn't count on his Iranian audiences sharing other
    cultural reference points -- but now he has all sorts of new
    material and costumes to go with it.
28. [Rupert Murdoch](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q53944)
    ([2002/02/24/1370183](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/24/magazine/the-satellite-subversives.html))

    In the course of his 23-year pontificate, the holy father -- who is
    81 and ailing but may yet turn out to be **the Strom Thurmond of**

    of capitalism.

    Re ''Defector Indignant at President of Harvard'' (news article,
    April 16): Prof. Cornel West's description of Lawrence H. Summers,
    the president of Harvard, as ''**the Ariel Sharon of** *American

    It is important for our new faculty colleague Cornel West to know
    that even as we welcome him back in our midst, we look with strong
    disfavor upon his characterization of Lawrence H. Summers, the

    Contemporary accounts called Rice ''**the Democritus of** *the

    ([2002/04/28/1387791](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/28/nyregion/work-in-progress.html))
    The company calls Reader's Digest ''the most widely read magazine in
    the world,'' though a Canadian newspaper columnist recently referred
    to it as ''**the Barry Manilow of** *magazines*,'' because of its
    ''irresistible banality.''

    ([2002/05/05/1389495](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/05/books/books-in-brief-nonfiction-752452.html))
    Though Lawrence's memoir veers off in unexpected directions -- her
    discussions of spirituality and visions make her seem like **the
    Shirley MacLaine of** *Madison Avenue* -- she is generally frank and
    forthright about what made her and her peers tick and why it helped
    to have, as she did, training as an actress with Sanford Meisner
    (''I began to theatricalize what I sold'').
67. [Elvis Presley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q303)

    hipster incarnate.
70. [Diana Ross](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36290)
    ([2002/05/12/1391616](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/12/movies/summer-movies-sequels-sure-but-godard-too.html))
    Austin's new love interest is Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyoncé Knowles,
    **the Diana Ross of** *Destiny's Child*, with a 70's Afro the size
    of a beach ball), and he's sure to have his mind on romance.
71. [Bob Vila](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q888302)

    Frederick Ashton was **the Shakespeare of** *ballet* -- not the
    playwright who composed revenge tragedies, but the poet who wrote
    love sonnets.
76. [Charlton Heston](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q80739)
    ([2002/06/02/1396996](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/02/books/cooking.html))
    Ted Nugent is, of course, the 70's-era gonzo rock star (''Cat
    Scratch Fever'') who's become **the Charlton Heston of** *the VH1
    ''Behind the Music'' generation*.
77. [Vera Wang](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q230728)

    Although James M. Roux, 42, stoutly described his partner as ''**the
    Johnnie Cochran of** *Katmandu*,'' Mr. Roux himself, a spirited
    litigator, outdoorsman and windmill-tilter, made impracticality an
    art form.
81. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)

    He carried off a frantic, spidery version of Vivaldi's ''Winter''
    concerto (abridged) and followed it with some remarks about how
    Paganini was ''**the Mick Jagger of** *the 19th century*.''
84. [Shaquille O'Neal](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q169452)

    ([2002/06/26/1403602](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/26/world/afghan-women-in-political-spotlight.html))
    A newspaper published two days before the loya jirga began on June
    11 quoted Dr. Samar as saying she did not believe in Islamic Shariat
    law -- a misquote, she says -- and called her **the Salman Rushdie
    of** *Afghanistan*, intimating she deserved the same death threat
    that the British author earned for alleged blasphemy in his work.
87. [James Dean](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q83359)
    ([2002/06/30/1404479](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/30/books/the-life-and-death-of-cool.html))

    ([2002/07/05/1405903](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/05/nyregion/boldface-names-861707.html)) Ms.
    Kan, whom People magazine once called **the Barbara Walters of**
    *China* because she was a mainstay of Chinese television for years,

    By then, he was more like **the John Wayne of** *the post*-''True

    In the depths, a young woman, Maria (Brigitte Helm, **the Kirsten
    Dunst of** *the Weimar Republic*), prophesies the coming of a
    messianic figure called the Mediator, whose name sums up the
    temperate, reformist message buried in the movie's sweep
    and bombast.
97. [Tiger Woods](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q10993)
    ([2002/07/16/1408731](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/16/travel/food-monsieur-vrinat-s-monument.html))

    ([2002/07/17/1408897](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/17/opinion/swastikas-for-sweeps.html))
    They don't want to see a glossy, sympathetic ''Lifestyles of the
    Reich and Fascist'': a cute, brooding teenage Hitler painting away
    in a garret, listening to Wagner (**the Eminem of** *his age*),
    hanging at the cafes in Vienna with Wittgenstein and Freud,
    accumulating disappointments and rejections as raw material for
    ''Mein Kampf,'' roiled by sexual confusion, frightened by the
    advances of an amorous milkmaid, and like everyone else then and
    now, steamed at the French.
99. [John Grisham](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q106465)
    ([2002/07/18/1409060](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/18/books/making-books-the-best-stealer-list.html))

    Protracted farewells are traditionally the province of opera
    singers, but as he has geared up to leave the directorship of the
    New York Philharmonic, Kurt Masur has become **the Barry Bonds of**
    *goodbyes*.
102. [Margaret Mead](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q180099)

    ([2002/07/28/1411475](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/28/magazine/dysfunction-for-dollars.html))
    He segues from his comic impersonations (''I'm **the Robin Williams
    of** *child abuse*,'' Pelzer says) into stories of his own abuse and
    ends with the platitude, ''Everyone has issues.
106. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)

    The tens of thousands of songs Lomax recorded himself -- across the
    United States and in rural Italy, the Caribbean, Great Britain and
    Spain -- and the many others he worked to analyze and disseminate
    made him **the Johnny Appleseed of** *folk revivalists*.
107. [John Ashcroft](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q311141)

    With fortunes made and lost in recent years as capitalism has gone
    global, there has been no shortage of writers aspiring to be **the
    John Grisham of** *Wall Street*, everyone from old-timers like
    Michael Thomas to newcomers like Scott Lasser.
110. [Tito Puente](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q317122)

    ([2002/08/18/1416595](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/18/nyregion/long-island-journal-a-hunka-hunka-burning-elvis-imitators.html))

    The wry, sexy melancholy of his observations would be seductive
    enough in its own right -- he is **the Leonard Cohen of** *the spy
    genre* -- even without the sharp political acuity that
    accompanies it.
113. [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([2002/08/25/1418681](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/25/sports/baseball-giambi-proves-patience-does-go-a-long-way.html))

    They can remember when **the George Hamilton of** *tennis*, the
    tanned Nick Bollettieri, could be spotted drinking in the sunshine
    as he eyed academy stars like Andre Agassi and Jim Courier during a
    golden era of paint-by-number instruction.
115. [Luther Burbank](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q333419)
    ([2002/08/29/1419367](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/29/garden/garden-notebook-turning-cactuses-into-connecticut-yankees.html)) Mr.
    Spain, 81, is **the Luther Burbank of** *winter-hardy cactuses in
    the Northeast*.

    ([2002/08/31/1419823](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/31/books/shelf-life-in-those-days-too-blood-and-sex-could-make-a-best-seller.html))
    ''Then came Matthew Lewis, the genre's first punk, **the Johnny
    Rotten of** *the Gothic novel*.''
117. [Bill Gates](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5284)
    ([2002/08/31/1419828](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/31/world/the-saturday-profile-the-first-afronaut-plans-a-mission-back-home.html))
    As a youthful entrepreneur challenging global business giants, Mr.
    Shuttleworth was lauded as **the Bill Gates of** *South Africa*.
118. [Mike Tyson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q79031)
    ([2002/09/04/1420809](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/04/movies/critic-s-notebook-a-reporter-who-answers-when-opportunity-knocks.html)) Mr.
    Douglas, with his seething hostility, is **the Mike Tyson of**
    *actors*.
119. [Sugar Ray Robinson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q316706)
    ([2002/09/04/1420809](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/04/movies/critic-s-notebook-a-reporter-who-answers-when-opportunity-knocks.html))
    He was the best -- **the Sugar Ray Robinson of** *comedy-drama*.
120. [Michelangelo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5592)
    ([2002/09/08/1421681](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/08/books/stardom-is-its-own-reward.html))
    ''I HAVE, you know, in my time been called -- in print -- **the
    Michelangelo of** *confectioners*,'' says the proprietor of a Los
    Angeles store where the movie star Kaye Wayfaring buys
    white-chocolate-dipped strawberries.
121. [Robert Moses](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1111386)
    ([2002/09/15/1423720](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/15/arts/music-anybody-listening-a-hapless-history.html))
    The general assumption was, and remains, that Judson's mania for
    power -- with his empire of orchestras, soloists and conductors, he
    was **the Robert Moses of** *American classical music for half a
    century* -- predisposed him toward conductors he could mentor or
    otherwise control.
122. [Adolf Hitler](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q352)
    ([2002/09/19/1424847](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/19/opinion/the-german-problem.html))
    His semi-conservative opponent, Edmund Stoiber, tut-tuts about
    anti-Americanism but is afraid to take a stand against **the Hitler
    of** *the Persian Gulf*.
123. [Richard Nixon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9588)
    ([2002/09/20/1425037](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/20/books/books-of-the-times-new-detail-about-the-bickering-builders-of-the-bomb.html))
    In addition to Oppenheimer, Mr. Herken has chosen to focus on two
    other prominent scientists who played crucial roles in nuclear
    research: Ernest O. Lawrence, the Nobel laureate, who invented the
    cyclotron and presided over Berkeley's Radiation Laboratory, which
    looked to benefit from lucrative government financing; and Edward
    Teller, the Hungarian émigré physicist, who helped invent the
    hydrogen bomb and whose dark, brooding personality caused Richard
    Rhodes to dub him ''**the Richard Nixon of** *American science*.''
124. [Mick Jagger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q128121)
    ([2002/09/22/1425730](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/22/arts/dance-like-rock-stars-abroad-like-hmm-yes-at-home.html))
    But with his turbulent energy, penetrating gaze and wiry
    physique, Mr. Pendleton, 53, could be considered **the Mick Jagger
    of** *the dance world*.
125. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([2002/09/27/1426969](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/27/sports/sports-of-the-times-defining-fair-play-is-tricky.html))
    Television is **the Johnny Appleseed of** *bad manners*, displaying
    assorted baiting, gesturing and mouthing off -- and that is just
    from the talk-show hosts in the studios.
126. [Percy Foreman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11212217)
    ([2002/09/28/1427197](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/28/us/warren-e-burnett-is-dead-colorful-lawyer-was-75.html))
    He insisted that he was not **the Percy Foreman of** *Odessa*, but
    that Mr. Foreman, the famed lawyer, was the Warren Burnett
    of Houston.
127. [Bob Barker](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q381178)
    ([2002/09/29/1427456](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/29/nyregion/long-island-journal-ding-dong-ready-for-a-shopping-spree.html))
    Aside from his news job, Mr. Hoff is **the Bob Barker of** *a new
    reality game show*, ''Spend It Fast,'' produced by Atlas Media for
    the Jericho-based Women's Entertainment Network.
128. [Sylvia Plath](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q133054)
    ([2002/09/29/1427827](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/29/books/not-so-elementary-watson.html))
    More recently Franklin has become, as Maddox puts it, ''**the Sylvia
    Plath of** *molecular biology*.''
129. [J. D. Salinger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q79904)
    ([2002/10/06/1429732](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/06/sports/yacht-racing-playground-of-billionaires.html))
    Bertarelli takes traditional Swiss discretion to new levels: as the
    only syndicate head who refuses to give interviews, he is **the J.
    D. Salinger of** *the docks*.
130. [Leonardo da Vinci](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q762)
    ([2002/10/10/1430643](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/10/business/media-business-advertising-buick-uses-mid-20th-century-designer-lure-younger.html))
    There is also a series of print ads, including a six-page magazine
    insert that thumbnails Mr. Earl's history and labels him ''**the da
    Vinci of** *Detroit*.''
131. [Helen Keller](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q38203)
    ([2002/10/13/1431340](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/13/magazine/appearances-deconstructing-duffy.html))
    Referring to me as **the Helen Keller of** *fashion*, they vowed to
    be my Annie Sullivans.
132. [Charlie Brown](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1168491)
    ([2002/10/14/1431931](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/14/world/conflict-in-oslo-over-a-pointed-peace-prize.html))
    Since then, Mr. Carter has been **the Charlie Brown of** *Nobel
    candidates*, nominated almost every year.
133. [Rudy Giuliani](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q212648)
    ([2002/10/16/1432309](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/16/opinion/black-heart-white-van.html))
    We know that Virginia's governor, Mark Warner, is bucking to be
    **the Rudy Giuliani of** *the crisis*; Kathleen Kennedy Townsend is
    trying to capitalize on her personal history with tragic gun
    killings to save her limp gubernatorial bid; Democrats in Congress
    tried to capitalize by rushing to pass a small-bore gun control
    measure that was going to pass anyway; President Bush and the G.O.P.
134. [Marco Polo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6101)
    ([2002/10/18/1432877](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/18/nyregion/for-2-world-plate-bronx-chef-culinary-travel-guide-for-elderly-diners.html)) Mr.
    Zurita, a professional chef who has clearly earned the title of
    **the Marco Polo of** *the mess hall*, gave it a moment's thought,
    then added Ethiopian, Greek, Israeli, Kenyan, Mexican, Portuguese,
    Dominican and Thai.
135. [Bill Clinton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1124)
    ([2002/10/20/1433181](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/20/books/the-tall-woman-from-small-britain.html))
    A likable seducer, he enjoyed a reputation as ''**the Bill Clinton
    of** *Sudan*.''
136. [Buster Keaton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103949)
    ([2002/10/20/1433258](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/20/arts/dance-serving-up-laughter-as-the-main-course.html))
    Robbins himself was a master of baggy-pants comedy in his Broadway
    days, and had it suited him, he probably could have become **the
    Buster Keaton of** *ballet* as well.
137. [Jane Goodall](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q184746)
    ([2002/10/20/1433275](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/20/arts/art-architecture-rock-s-house-photographer.html))
    I feel like I'm **the Jane Goodall of** *rock photography*.''
138. [Elvis Presley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q303)
    ([2002/10/28/1435756](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/28/business/the-angry-appeal-of-eminem-is-cutting-across-racial-lines.html))
    Only three years ago, he was derided as ''**the Elvis of**
    *hip-hop*,'' or a raw version of the 1980's flattopped performer
    Vanilla Ice (no comparison could be worse on these streets).
139. [Lech Wałęsa](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q444)
    ([2002/10/28/1435844](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/28/world/leftist-handily-wins-brazilian-presidential-race.html))
    Freed in 1980 after a worldwide campaign in which he was called
    ''**the Lech Walesa of** *Brazil*,'' Mr. da Silva, along with a
    group of intellectuals, labor leaders, Liberation Theology advocates
    and environmentalists soon thereafter founded the Workers' Party.
140. [Rosie Ruiz](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2777857)
    ([2002/10/30/1436301](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/30/nyregion/our-towns-a-quaint-state-where-rivals-really-debate.html))
    Former Senator Frank Lautenberg, **the Rosie Ruiz of** *the New
    Jersey race*, agreed to just two debates.
141. [Shaquille O'Neal](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q169452)
    ([2002/11/01/1436755](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/01/sports/pro-football-push-comes-to-shove-and-strahan-plays-on.html))
    But there was no flag on the play, one of many that have fueled the
    belief in the Giants' organization that in the first season after
    Strahan broke the record for sacks, rules do not seem to apply when
    it comes to stopping him -- as if Strahan has become **the Shaquille
    O'Neal of** *the N.F.L.*
142. [David Spade](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q298658)
    ([2002/11/03/1437138](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/03/magazine/in-the-land-of-the-insomniac-the-narcoleptic-wants-to-be-king.html))
    One longtime senior network executive says of ABC's gamble: ''To me
    this guy is **the David Spade of** *late night*.
143. [Paul Newman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41871)
    ([2002/11/03/1437189](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/03/arts/holiday-movies-santa-james-bond-and-other-old-friends.html))
    Amitabh Bachchan, **the Paul Newman of** *Bollywood*, stars as one
    of six complete strangers who team up to commit the perfect crime.
144. [J. D. Power](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6105295)
    ([2002/11/04/1437699](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/04/business/new-venture-hopes-to-offer-some-peace-of-mind-to-ceo-s.html))
    ''I'm not saying we'll be **the J. D. Power of** *corporate
    governance*,'' said Jack Kemp, the former Cabinet secretary and
    chairman of the new venture, referring to the reviewer
    of automobiles.
145. [Bill Buckner](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2903144)
    ([2002/11/07/1438644](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/07/us/the-2002-elections-the-pollster-man-at-the-uneasy-helm-of-voter-survey-service.html))
    But today Mr. Savaglio is **the Bill Buckner of** *American
    politics*.
146. [Cal Ripken](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q731168)
    ([2002/11/08/1438902](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/08/sports/baseball-japan-s-home-run-king-is-leaving.html))
    ''He's **the Cal Ripken of** *Japan*, but with more punch,'' said
    Marty Kuehnert, a sports broadcaster and longtime resident in Japan.
147. [Jackie Robinson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q221048)
    ([2002/11/10/1439577](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/10/nyregion/belmont-journal-keeping-old-age-at-bay-with-a-broomstick.html)) Mr.
    Stephens is quick to say that he is **the Jackie Robinson of**
    *stickball*, having been the first white man to play on an otherwise
    all-black team.
148. [Martha Stewart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234606)
    ([2002/11/17/1441244](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/17/nyregion/tasted-any-good-books-lately-read-any-good-recipes.html))
    Over the roar of laughter and loud party prattle, Ms. Haan, whom
    members refer to as ''**the Martha Stewart of** *the bunch*,''
    opened the neatly penned journal of memories she has kept since the
    club started.
149. [Imelda Marcos](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q285536)
    ([2002/11/17/1441248](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/17/nyregion/long-island-journal-putting-together-chronicles-of-their-lives.html))
    ''We all become **the Imelda Marcos of** *paper*,'' Ms.
    Kavanaugh said.
150. [Dick Cheney](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q48259)
    ([2002/11/23/1442995](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/23/nyregion/a-sermon-to-the-jury-why-i-deserve-to-live.html))
    He was **the Dick Cheney of** *ancient Egypt*.
151. [Raymond Carver](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q219862)
    ([2002/11/24/1443301](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/24/opinion/the-boomers-crooner.html))
    They rhapsodize that his amazing vignettes of dysfunctional families
    make him **the Raymond Carver of** *hip-hop*.
152. [Donald Trump](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686)
    ([2002/11/24/1443485](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/24/magazine/oversimulated-suburbia.html))
    (Already one player has become **the Donald Trump of** *the online
    Sims world*, acquiring enough money and property to open a string of
    coffee shops, stores and clubs.)
153. [César Tovar](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5202642)
    ([2002/11/27/1444117](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/27/sports/baseball-mets-offer-ticket-prices-to-suit-every-occasion.html))
    But there are nuances: a great team like the Atlanta Braves will
    cost more to watch on weekends than on weeknights, and a middling
    team like the Philadelphia Phillies has become a utilityman of
    sorts, **the César Tovar of** *the schedule*, moving through three
    ticket tiers depending on the date.
154. [Dick Clark](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q366563)
    ([2002/11/29/1444510](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/29/movies/hairspray-actors-all-have-stories-suddenly-people-are-listening.html))
    Corny Collins is ''**the Dick Clark of** *Baltimore*,'' Mr.
    Thorell said.
155. [Barry Diller](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q587455)
    ([2002/11/30/1444713](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/30/business/a-tv-talk-show-with-a-sales-twist.html))
    One might think of him as **the Barry Diller of** *Jackson
    Hole, Wyo.*, where Mr. Blum recently moved with his wife, Audrey, a
    former model, and their twins.
156. [Yves Saint Laurent](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q171556)
    ([2002/12/01/1444800](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/01/magazine/a-spaghetti-dress-for-world-peace.html))
    ''But Miguel was being heralded as **the Yves Saint Laurent of**
    *American fashion*.

    ([2002/12/03/1445460](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/03/arts/trudeau-chat-offers-koppel-and-his-style-a-showcase.html))
    But Mr. Trudeau, who has not given a sit-down television interview
    in 31 years, is **the J. D. Salinger of** *comic strip artists*.
158. [Adlai Stevenson II](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q311719)
    ([2002/12/09/1447293](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/09/world/threats-and-responses-strategy-a-tough-case-how-to-convict-hussein.html))
    The administration is betting that Mr. Saadi and his colleagues
    together will ultimately prove to be **the Adlai Stevenson of**
    *this drama*, that they will unintentionally provide the road map to
    continuing weapons projects, or false claims that those projects
    have been dismantled.
159. [Igor Stravinsky](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7314)
    ([2002/12/15/1448831](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/15/nyregion/county-lines-awol-on-the-errand-run.html))
    Al, who is 42 and has two children and can often be found listening
    to sports radio as his car idles in a parking lot, fancies himself
    **the Stravinsky of** *excuses*.
160. [Wernher von Braun](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q57384)
    ([2002/12/19/1449879](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/19/garden/the-chore-that-wants-more.html))
    Approached by the Whirlpool Corporation two years ago to be a
    consumer ''pilot'' for a next generation of fabric-care
    appliances, Mrs. Bova quickly proved to be **the Wernher von Braun
    of** *duds-in-suds*, pushing the \$10 billion company toward
    imagining a braver future -- brighter, cleaner, fresher!
161. [Adolf Hitler](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q352)
    ([2002/12/20/1450289](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/20/arts/art-in-review-andras-borocz.html))
    The traditional idea is to stamp the feet to drown out any mention
    of Haman, **the Hitler of** *his Biblical day*; Mr. Borocz has
    worked up elaborate wooden toys in which shoes are activated by
    cranks to produce that result.
162. [Rodney Dangerfield](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386)
    ([2002/12/21/1450439](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/21/us/washington-talk-after-all-these-years-what-do-you-say-now-chevy-chase.html))
    That is helping Gerald R. Ford, once parodied as **the Rodney
    Dangerfield of** *presidents*, to enjoy a rehabilitation of sorts,
    bringing new respect for his leadership skills.
163. [Ralph Fiennes](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q28493)
    ([2002/12/22/1450621](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/22/arts/music-look-what-they-re-doing-to-opera.html))
    The elegant British baritone Simon Keenlyside is **the Ralph Fiennes
    of** *opera*, not just an affectingly restrained actor, but, as his
    recent Lincoln Center performances in the choreographer Trisha
    Brown's staging of Schubert's song cycle ''Winterreise'' made clear,
    an agile dancer.
164. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([2002/12/22/1450658](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/22/nyregion/long-island-journal-on-the-hunt-cupid-s-arrow-in-his-quiver.html))
    He was introduced as **the Michael Jordan of** *hunting and
    fishing*.
165. [Hank Williams Jr.](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q552819)
    ([2002/12/26/1451562](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/26/arts/year-that-pop-lost-popularity-roster-no-1-cd-s-extreme-genres-led-pack.html))
    Take: Rushing to release this less than a year after his last
    album, Mr. Keith sings of vengeance, vacation and the rodeo,
    becoming **the Hank Williams Jr. of** *the moment*.
166. [James Brown](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5950)
    ([2002/12/27/1451810](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/27/nyregion/good-polls-and-lots-of-cash-but-still-no-rest-for-schumer.html))
    ''Chuck Schumer is **the James Brown of** *politics* -- no one works
    harder,'' said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant in New York.
167. [Lucia Pamela](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3838473)
    ([2002/12/29/1452071](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/29/magazine/the-lives-they-lived-flip-flop-fly.html))
    She's **the Lucia Pamela of** *her day*.
168. [Madonna](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1744)
    ([2002/12/29/1452073](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/29/magazine/the-lives-they-lived-is-that-all-there-is.html))
    Lee's vixeny style made her something like **the Madonna of** *her
    time* (an idea verified for me by, of all people, my neighborhood
    butcher, a New Deal baby who said of Lee, ''Oh, she was the

    ''He's **the Harry Cohn of** *today*.''
170. [Michelangelo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5592)
    ([2002/12/29/1452372](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/29/us/for-many-senators-the-choicest-of-all-perks-is-office-space.html)) Mr.
    Byrd has occupied an extraordinarily beautiful suite, resplendent
    with frescoes by Constantino Brumidi, the Italian artist often
    called **the Michelangelo of** *the Capitol*.
171. [Mick Jagger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q128121)
    ([2002/12/30/1452742](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/30/books/books-of-the-times-a-troublemaker-walked-in-beauty.html))
    Lord Byron was **the Mick Jagger of** *his time*, ''mad, bad, and
    dangerous to know,'' in the words of his tragic admirer
    Caroline Lamb.

1.  [Ernest Shackleton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q957543)
    ([2003/01/05/1453822](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/05/books/50-million-frenchmen-can-t-be-wrong.html))
    The 19th-century explorer Richard Burton, **the Ernest Shackleton
    of** *sex*, wrote that if a woman can perform this technique, ''her
    husband will then value her above all women, nor would he exchange
    her for the most beautiful queen in the Three Worlds.''
2.  [Ava Gardner](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q164487)
    ([2003/01/10/1455219](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/10/arts/hispanic-treasures-awaiting-discovery.html))
    Strolling into the main room, designed to resemble a Renaissance
    Spanish courtyard, you come face to face with ''The Duchess of
    Alba,'' Goya's memorable portrait of **the Ava Gardner of** *Spanish
    nobility*.
3.  [Rosa Parks](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41921)
    ([2003/01/12/1455754](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/12/education/where-the-girls-aren-t.html))
    ''The question is, who wants to be **the Rosa Parks of** *computer
    science*?''
4.  [Alex Rodriguez](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q558664)
    ([2003/01/12/1456006](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/12/sports/baseball-inside-baseball-teams-are-playing-musical-chairs-in-bullpens.html))
    Last year, the Rangers acted as if they were signing **the Alex
    Rodriguez of** *relievers*, giving Jay Powell a three-year, \$9
    million contract and Todd Van Poppel a three-year, \$7.5
    million deal.
5.  [John F. Kennedy](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9696)
    ([2003/01/19/1457548](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/19/magazine/the-makeover.html))
    But how to reconcile those rumors with others that have him down as
    a world-class womanizer, **the Jack Kennedy of** *the Sahara*, or
    with the official line that lists him as a doting husband and father
    to his seven children?
6.  [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([2003/01/19/1457551](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/19/magazine/a-grizzly-task.html))
    If Wilt Chamberlain was **the Babe Ruth of** *basketball*, the
    outsize figure who forever changed his game's frame of reference,
    then West was the sport's DiMaggio, its understated classicist.
7.  [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([2003/01/23/1458686](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/23/sports/the-ski-report-olympic-aerialist-falls-back-to-earth.html))
    It was Feb. 19, 2002 and Eric Bergoust, **the Babe Ruth of**
    *freestyle aerials*, stood at the crest of a snowy hill making the
    last preparations for his final jump at the Salt Lake City
    Olympic Games.
8.  [Nell Gwyn](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234163)
    ([2003/02/02/1461536](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/02/opinion/double-timing-the-king.html))
    One can almost imagine Mrs. Simpson in the court of Charles II, the
    Lady Castlemaine, if not **the Nell Gwyn of** *her day*.
9.  [Julius Caesar](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1048)
    ([2003/02/06/1462734](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/06/sports/sports-of-the-times-colts-finding-motivation-in-new-way.html))
    Jim Irsay, the eccentric son of the erratic Bob Irsay, **the Caesar
    of** *sports carpetbaggers*, is now running the show for the Colts.
10. [Adolf Hitler](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q352)
    ([2003/02/07/1462973](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/07/opinion/war-and-wisdom.html))
    A better analogy is Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya, who used to be
    denounced as **the Hitler of** *the 1980's*.
11. [Adolf Hitler](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q352)
    ([2003/02/07/1462973](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/07/opinion/war-and-wisdom.html))
    The same was said of Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser, whom the West saw
    as **the Hitler of** *the 1950's and 1960's*.
12. [Martin Luther King, Jr.](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8027)
    ([2003/02/09/1463692](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/09/sports/pro-basketball-who-will-replace-jordan-s-star-power.html))
    ''He's like **the Martin Luther King of** *basketball*,'' Kevin
    Garnett of the Minnesota Timberwolves said.
13. [Walt Disney](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8704)
    ([2003/02/10/1463847](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/10/business/as-animation-goes-digital-disney-fights-for-its-crown.html))
    Another question is, Who will be **the Walt Disney of** *this era*?
14. [Richard Strauss](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q13894)
    ([2003/02/23/1467023](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/23/arts/music-a-provocative-dane-whose-bold-music-is-also-meticulous.html))
    The virtuosic writing, grand gestures and extremes of volume, with
    antecedents in ''Solar Trilogy'' (1992-95), Mr. Ruders's sprawling
    symphonic drama, illustrate the British critic Stephen Johnson's
    often repeated description of Mr. Ruders as ''**the Richard Strauss
    of** *the computer-age orchestra*.''
15. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([2003/02/23/1467070](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/23/realestate/postings-housing-group-builds-for-profit-project-brooklyn-12-market-rentals-two.html))
    ''We want to be **the Johnny Appleseed of** *these projects*,'' Mr.
    Bee said, ''so we can see more of them proliferate.''
16. [Johnnie Cochran](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1346641)
    ([2003/02/23/1467291](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/23/nyregion/a-civil-tenor-for-civil-rights.html))
    Perhaps less flatteringly, Mr. Brewington also is sometimes called
    **the Johnnie Cochran of** *Long Island*.
17. [Thurgood Marshall](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q312348)
    ([2003/02/23/1467291](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/23/nyregion/a-civil-tenor-for-civil-rights.html))
    HE is sometimes called **the Thurgood Marshall of** *Long Island*.
18. [Caligula](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1409)
    ([2003/02/25/1467644](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/25/science/a-revolution-at-50-watson-and-crick-both-aligned-and-apart-reinvented-biology.html))
    One of these, Dr. Edward O. Wilson, called him in a memoir ''**the
    Caligula of** *biology*.''
19. [Vanna White](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q442202)
    ([2003/02/26/1467976](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/26/nyregion/the-college-remembers-lehman-its-students-not-so-much.html))
    She was **the Vanna White of** *the day* -- the person who spelled
    ''Herbert H. Lehman,'' letter by letter, on a sign announcing a
    symposium that looked at his place in history and his place in the
    participants' memories.
20. [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254)
    ([2003/03/02/1468803](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/02/magazine/ozark-spring.html))
    In 1964, the United States Congress authorized that land all along
    the Jacks Fork River (once described by a boater as **the Mozart
    of** *rivers*) would be part of the 80,000-acre park, the first of
    the national riverways.
21. [Cornelia Guest](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5171165)
    ([2003/03/02/1468986](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/02/style/shaken-and-stirred-new-before-its-time.html))
    The cosmopolitan was a kind of fast debutante that showed up in the
    1980's and 90's -- **the Cornelia Guest of** *cocktails*.
22. [Matthew McConaughey](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q188955)
    ([2003/03/07/1470289](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/07/movies/on-stage-and-off.html))
    Rodney Gilfry, the strapping, blond baritone who has been called
    ''**the Matthew McConaughey of** *opera*'' (for good or bad), will
    star in this spring's Encores!
23. [Martha Stewart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234606)
    ([2003/03/09/1470825](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/09/magazine/footnotes-632546.html))
    As **the Martha Stewart of** *the hippie age*, Alicia Bay Laurel
    wrote the book on living in do-it-yourself harmony with
    Mother Nature.
24. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([2003/03/09/1471019](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/09/sports/baseball-image-is-not-everything-when-subject-is-griffey.html))
    ''He's **the Michael Jordan of** *the game*,'' Bowden said.
25. [Alexander the Great](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8409)
    ([2003/03/18/1473251](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/18/science/lost-city-yielding-its-secrets.html))
    That was in the reign of Pachacuti, considered **the Alexander the
    Great of** *the Incas*.
26. [Donald Rumsfeld](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q184650)
    ([2003/03/18/1473361](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/18/opinion/cassandra-speaks.html))
    Agamemnon was **the Donald Rumsfeld of** *his day*, needlessly
    angering his key allies -- and outraging Achilles by swiping his
    concubine Briseis.
27. [Donald Trump](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686)
    ([2003/03/20/1473894](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/20/business/hospital-chain-is-accused-of-accounting-fraud.html))
    Capitalizing on generous Medicare payments for physical
    rehabilitation, he built enough personal wealth to become known as
    **the Donald Trump of** *Birmingham*.
28. [Ed McMahon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q555370)
    ([2003/03/23/1474775](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/23/nyregion/long-island-journal-a-form-of-heaven-on-a-riverhead-stage.html))
    ''We're **the Ed McMahon of** *the health business*,'' Mr. Freeman
    said, alluding to the Publishers Clearing House contest where
    winners are also informed of their luck with the ring of a doorbell.
29. [John James Audubon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q182882)
    ([2003/03/30/1476563](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/30/nyregion/casting-a-line-around-the-world.html))
    For this skill, he has been hailed ''**the Audubon of** *trout*.''
30. [Tom Ridge](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q559822)
    ([2003/03/30/1476699](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/30/books/the-end-of-the-earth.html))
    Reisner is **the Tom Ridge of** *the ecology*: he's put us all on
    red alert, but, short of vacating the state altogether, it's hard to
    know what to do about it; and never addressed is the question that,
    for all we know, Reisner might have tried to answer here had he
    lived, and that's what it is that continues to draw people to the
    continent's death row.
31. [Bill Gates](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5284)
    ([2003/03/30/1476700](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/30/books/the-global-villain.html))
    One might well object that there is nothing representative about
    them: he talks to **the Bill Gates of** *India*; he manages to find
    a non-Coptic Christian family in Egypt (who complained that the
    Americans weren't as tough on Muslims as the Israelis were).
32. [Leonardo da Vinci](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q762)
    ([2003/03/30/1476728](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/30/magazine/style-an-eye-for-the-ladies.html))
    He's very knowledgeable about fine art but has no idea who Krazy Kat
    is, and he's like **the Leonardo da Vinci of** *the cartoon world*.
33. [Henri Matisse](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5589)
    ([2003/04/04/1477871](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/04/arts/art-review-praising-nadelman-or-burying-him.html))
    Nadelman, who was born in Warsaw in 1882, one year after Picasso,
    and committed suicide in the Riverdale section of the Bronx in 1946,
    was in many ways **the Matisse of** *20th-century sculpture*.
34. [Wolfgang Puck](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q78893)
    ([2003/04/06/1478378](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/06/travel/choice-tables-a-tropical-smorgasbord-in-honolulu.html))
    Roy Yamaguchi is **the Wolfgang Puck of** *the Pacific*.
35. [Giacomo Casanova](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q83321)
    ([2003/04/06/1478430](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/06/nyregion/theater-review-classic-shakespeare-kiss-me-kevin.html))
    In the prologue, high-decibel dissonance suggests a New Age ''West
    Side Story,'' with a fiesta-like rumble, as Joseph Urla struts as
    Petruchio, **the Casanova of** *the Barrio*.
36. [Jackie Robinson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q221048)
    ([2003/04/06/1478600](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/06/nyregion/urban-tactics-on-chinatown-s-basketball-courts-it-s-the-year-of-yao.html))
    ''He's **the Jackie Robinson of** *my generation*,'' he said.
37. [Al Capone](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q80048)
    ([2003/04/06/1478782](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/06/books/the-wild-child.html))
    And Elizabeth has apparently found a way: while visiting an obscure
    museum on her freelance job doing research for a London travel
    guide, she stumbles upon the skeleton of the notorious criminal
    Jonathan Wild -- ''**the Al Capone of** *the 1720's*'' -- whom she
    regards as something of a kindred spirit.
38. [Kato Kaelin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6377737)
    ([2003/04/07/1478881](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/07/books/books-of-the-times-the-real-estate-agents-who-know-all-see-all.html))
    Then he has settled in -- as ''a permanent house guest, **the Kato
    Kaelin of** *the wine country*,'' in the case of Alan Deutschman --
    and tried to figure out what it all means.
39. [Robert Trent Jones](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1771239)
    ([2003/04/11/1479837](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/11/travel/driving-the-racers-are-sleek-but-the-track-is-sleeker.html))
    ''I would say he is **the Robert Trent Jones of** *tracks*.''
40. [Spike Lee](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q51566)
    ([2003/04/12/1480088](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/12/world/the-saturday-profile-a-bold-new-view-of-turkish-german-youth.html))
    Now it is also becoming known as the territory of a former graffiti
    sprayer and youth gang member, Neco Celik, whose debut movie,
    ''Alltag,'' or ''Every Day,'' is gaining him a reputation as **the
    Spike Lee of** *his time and place*.
41. [Salvador Dalí](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5577)
    ([2003/04/13/1480261](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/13/magazine/guilty-pleasures.html))
    Tom Wolfe called him **the Salvador Dali of** *the car circuit*.
42. [Harvey Weinstein](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q531599)
    ([2003/04/13/1480281](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/13/books/brought-to-you-by-s-p-eagle.html))
    Like Goldwyn and Selznick before him, but smarter than either of
    them, he was a maverick, though one with establishment tastes and
    goals -- **the Harvey Weinstein of** *his day*, making the kind of
    movie that seemed custom-designed to win Academy Awards.
43. [Mick Jagger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q128121)
    ([2003/04/13/1480317](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/13/magazine/commute-to-nowhere.html))
    And so by the time Jeff met Mara, in 1997, he was a wizened rock
    star, **the Mick Jagger of** *digital media*.
44. [Cecil B. DeMille](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q72267)
    ([2003/04/13/1480367](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/13/movies/film-mickey-rourke-is-sorry-very-very-very-sorry.html))
    As a result, too many people still think of him -- if they think of
    him at all -- as a cautionary tale, an epic of career wreckage,
    **the Cecil B. DeMille of** *Hollywood zombies*, a damaged survivor
    of some terrible accident at the intersection of self-loathing
    and self-regard.
45. [Norman Rockwell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q271884)
    ([2003/04/13/1480412](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/13/nyregion/art-review-in-magazine-pages-the-roots-of-a-career.html))
    During this period, he become the most famous illustrator in the
    country, **the Norman Rockwell of** *his day*.
46. [Hulk Hogan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q44176)
    ([2003/04/14/1480850](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/14/books/books-of-the-times-elegant-magazine-avalanche-of-dirt.html))
    Meanwhile, at 5 feet 10 tall and 115 pounds, Andy is **the Hulk
    Hogan of** *this food-phobic crowd*.
47. [Nora Roberts](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q231356)
    ([2003/04/17/1481531](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/17/books/critic-s-notebook-murder-they-wrote-and-wrote.html))
    For those who write like clockwork (i.e., Stuart Woods, **the Nora
    Roberts of** *mystery best-sellerdom*), a new book every few months
    is no surprise.
48. [Michelangelo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5592)
    ([2003/04/18/1481787](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/18/arts/antiques-a-sculptor-hears-the-call-of-the-wild.html))
    (The French critic Théophile Gautier called him **the Michelangelo
    of** *the menagerie*.)
49. [Ben Johnson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q52614)
    ([2003/04/20/1482221](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/20/tv/cover-story-helen-overcomes-bad-men-and-bad-press.html))
    ''It was like **the Ben Johnson of** *goats*!
50. [RuPaul](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q705715)
    ([2003/04/20/1482270](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/20/arts/gay-rappers-too-real-for-hip-hop.html))
    Caushun says there were labels that wanted to turn him into a
    house-music artist or into **the RuPaul of** *hip-hop*, but he
    said no.
51. [Maurice Béjart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q217764)
    ([2003/04/21/1482749](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/21/arts/dance-review-a-pinocchio-whose-nose-never-grows.html))
    Boris Eifman may be **the Maurice Béjart of** *our time*.
52. [Pablo Picasso](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5593)
    ([2003/04/27/1484223](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/27/nyregion/art-review-nothing-out-of-the-ordinary-but-more-than-meets-the-eye.html))
    Pierre Hermé, a Frenchman who was once called **the Picasso of**
    *Pastry* in Vogue magazine, has trained bakers to create tartes,
    individual pastries and macaroons.
53. [Barry Diller](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q587455)
    ([2003/05/01/1485294](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/01/us/the-tv-watch-a-one-time-media-diva-tries-to-find-her-way-on-a-new-stage.html))
    But at other times, the conversation was reminiscent of dinner
    parties with the high and mighty during which the hostess asks the
    powerful man to her left a fawning question -- ''Who is **the Barry
    Diller of** *the Democratic Party*?''
54. [Richard Perle](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q966859)
    ([2003/05/04/1485914](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/04/magazine/the-thinkable.html))
    Even Shingo Nishimura, a staunch parliamentary militarist who was
    described to me as ''**the Richard Perle of** *Japan*'' (he was once
    fired from the cabinet for lamenting Japan's nuclear impotence),

    uncommon patient.

    Aside from hotel renovations, Mr. Van Meter said other signs of
    growth were making the area more appealing to the kind of New

    they were Bill Clinton -- new restaurants with ''real chefs''
    (''When I read that chef Susanna Foo, considered **the David Bouley

    Gertrude Berg, the accentless, Columbia University-educated
    granddaughter of immigrants who created, produced, wrote and starred
    in the show (she played Molly), became **the Oprah Winfrey of** *her

    The show, which is the latest opus by David Simon, the journalist
    turned producer who has become, with ''Homicide'' and ''The
    Corner,'' **the Balzac of** *postindustrial Maryland*, takes what
    might have looked like an exhausted set of premises -- a motley

    Allen, **the Simon Cowell of** *the board*, suggests that Cousin

    One man, **the Cal Ripken of** *the sport*, has been surfing every

    ([2003/09/14/1519492](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/14/style/fashion-week-is-fashion-still-cool.html))
    You look at Christina Aguilera, and she has all the affectations of
    somebody who would be a rocker, and then you hear her songs and you
    think, Is this **the Julie London of** *today*?''
116. [Donald Trump](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686)
    ([2003/09/14/1519493](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/14/business/business-from-a-texas-trump-plans-that-amaze-or-annoy.html))
    ''Tilman Fertitta is like **the Donald Trump of** *the Southwest*,''
    said Frances Farenthold, known as Sissy, who represented Corpus
    Christi in the Texas Legislature from 1968 to 1973 and is a staunch
    opponent of the proposed deal in that city.
117. [Dennis Rodman](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q201608)
    ([2003/09/21/1521031](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/21/magazine/road-rage.html))
    David Coulthard, of the McLaren Mercedes racing team, models for
    Hugo Boss; Jacques Villeneuve, **the Dennis Rodman of** *the racing
    world*, colors his hair and is fussy about his racing gear; and
    Flavio Briatore, a former leader of the Benetton racing team and the
    manager of the Renault crew, owns a trendy nightclub in Sardinia and
    has been dating the supermodel Heidi Klum.
118. [Mohammad Khatami](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q180795)
    ([2003/09/21/1521049](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/21/books/the-puritan-dilemma.html))

    ([2003/09/30/1523575](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/30/opinion/trading-memories.html))
    Most of the candidates are selling decidedly protectionist messages,
    as if seeking to become **the Ross Perot of** *the 2004 race*, not
    the Bill Clinton.
121. [Barry Bonds](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q314712)
    ([2003/10/03/1524243](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/03/movies/film-review-a-train-depot-more-dream-than-destination.html)) Ms.
    Clarkson has been delivering meaty, juicy plums to movies for
    several years; she's become **the Barry Bonds of** *low-budget
    film*.
122. [Bear Bryant](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q278804)
    ([2003/10/04/1524605](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/04/sports/college-football-longhorns-brown-knows-only-winning-will-quiet-critics.html))

    Bonington, whom Delacroix called **the Raphael of** *landscape
    painting*, is represented by a luminous work called ''A Fishmarket
    Near Boulogne,'' which made a splash in the 1824 Salon.
125. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)

    ([2003/10/19/1528235](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/19/magazine/the-last-emperor.html))
    Hwang was **the Karl Rove of** *North Korea* for more than three
    decades, creating the ideology of Juche, or self-sufficiency, that
    was the bedrock of Kim Il Sung's regime and remains in place today
    -- though in name only, since North Korea depends on foreign aid for
    its survival.
128. [Arthur Freed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q709413)
    ([2003/10/22/1529132](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/22/movies/film-review-the-loss-of-relationships-under-mao-s-rough-revolutionary-hand.html))
    ''The East Is Red,'' photographed in volcanic color, splashes its
    propaganda in terms so simple that the scenes become almost
    Brechtian; more specifically, it's a crude Minnelli musical
    essentially produced by Mao, **the Arthur Freed of** *Communism*.
129. [Carl Sagan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q410)
    ([2003/10/26/1530026](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/26/tv/cover-story-string-theory-visualizing-the-weirdness.html)) Dr.
    Greene is **the Carl Sagan of** *this new multidimensional cosmos*,
    diving through wormholes to travel instantaneously the length of
    Manhattan, lecturing on relativity to his dog, encountering multiple
    disconnected copies of himself in the quantum cafe, where an order
    of orange juice may get you a glass of blue liquid instead.
130. [Bob Costas](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2458861)

    ([2003/10/26/1530036](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/26/magazine/the-takedown-artist.html))
    Not only has he managed to get himself talked about (''Dale Peck is
    **the Michael Ovitz of** *the literary world*,'' says the literary
    agent Bonnie Nadell); he has managed to stir up a debate over the
    practice of book reviewing -- its status, its value, its effect on
    our literary culture.
132. [Annie Leibovitz](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q225283)
    ([2003/10/26/1530084](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/26/arts/art-the-eminent-photographer-of-eminent-victorians.html))
    The Guardian called Cameron ''**the Annie Leibovitz of** *her
    day*,'' The Observer cited her as a precursor of Richard Avedon and
    The Independent said her portraits of the famous were ''publicity
    shots to die for.''

    ([2003/10/26/1530219](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/26/business/business-when-jobs-move-overseas-to-south-carolina.html)) Mr.

    ([2003/10/31/1531415](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/31/arts/family-fare.html))

    ([2003/11/02/1531930](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/02/movies/holiday-movies-remembering-the-alamo-whatever-happened.html))
    The Alamo was, as Steve Harrigan likes to say, a story of second
    chances: Crockett, **the Arnold Schwarzenegger of** *his time*, was
    moving from celebrity to politics; Travis, a young and untested
    lawyer turned soldier, was searching for gravitas.
137. [John Coltrane](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7346)
    ([2003/11/02/1531956](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/02/travel/san-francisco-for-less-gold.html))
    The five-man jazz-funk ensemble unleashed dizzyingly layered
    rhythms, with **the John Coltrane of** *harmonica players* and a
    spoken-word vocalist.
138. [Sam Rayburn](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1378052)
    ([2003/11/02/1532193](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/02/nyregion/for-joseph-doria-a-rare-election-he-s-not-running.html))
    Donald Scarinci, a Hudson County attorney who was Mr. Doria's
    counsel in the speaker's office, described his former boss as
    ''**the Sam Rayburn of** *New Jersey*,'' referring to the legendary
    Texan who served as House speaker for all but four years from 1940
    to 1961.
139. [Peter Mayle](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q531759)
    ([2003/11/09/1534152](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/09/books/four-legs-and-flies.html))
    Thus begins a love story that drives this new memoir (the second of
    what looks to be a series, initiated two years ago with the
    publication of ''Country Matters,'' which earned its British-born
    author the reputation of being **the Peter Mayle of** *Dutchess
    County*).
140. [Daniel Burnham](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q316639)
    ([2003/11/09/1534198](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/09/movies/architecture-when-the-ultimate-monument-isn-t-a-building.html))
    Also, Philadelphia had two giants in the fields of architecture and
    city planning: Kahn and the legendary Ed Bacon, **the Daniel Burnham
    of** *postwar American planning*.
141. [Michelangelo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5592)
    ([2003/11/11/1534480](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/11/sports/tv-sports-nfl-today-tomorrow-a-coach.html))
    The prototype was Bill Parcells, who, while working for NBC after he
    left the Giants, was **the Michelangelo of** *saying he did not
    interview with clubs he had clearly interviewed with*.
142. [Rich Little](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1341644)
    ([2003/11/16/1535536](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/16/books/children-s-books-in-brief-038296.html))
    Happily, in the end he discovers a talent that sets him up as **the
    Rich Little of** *the elephant world*, and he wows his formerly
    scornful schoolmates with snorts that transform his trunk into a
    veritable menagerie.
143. [Oscar Wilde](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30875)
    ([2003/11/16/1535891](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/16/nyregion/theater-onstage-ambivalence-and-despair.html))
    It's not for nothing that Orton was referred to as **the Oscar Wilde
    of** *his time*.
144. [Martin Luther](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9554)
    ([2003/11/20/1536867](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/20/nyregion/public-lives-embracing-a-father-s-creation-if-not-his-tastes.html))
    Tom Wolfe called Mr. Hartford ''**the Martin Luther of** *modern
    culture*,'' a zealot with ''the most flagrantly unfashionable taste
    anybody in New York had ever heard of.''
145. [Johann Sebastian Bach](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1339)
    ([2003/11/27/1538569](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/27/arts/city-ballet-review-celebrating-balanchine-from-kinky-to-classic.html))
    Centenaries come and go, but celebrating the 100th anniversary of
    the birth of George Balanchine (Jan. 22, 1904) is not like an
    anniversary tribute to Bach (although Balanchine is certainly **the
    Bach of** *choreographers*).
146. [Martha Stewart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234606)
    ([2003/11/27/1538582](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/27/opinion/how-women-won-the-holidays.html))
    She was **the Martha Stewart of** *the pre-Civil War era*, filling
    up her hugely popular magazine, Godey's Lady's Book, with all sorts
    of advice about how to build a dream cottage, cook a seven-course
    dinner and decorate the perfect spring hat.
147. [D. H. Lawrence](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q34970)
    ([2003/11/30/1539110](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/30/books/urban-studies.html))
    In its wake Perry is left feeling like ''**the D. H. Lawrence of**
    *not doing it*, the voice of all the would-be lovers who ached and
    squirmed.''
148. [Napoleon](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q517)
    ([2003/11/30/1539168](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/30/realestate/streetscapes-readers-questions-uptown-mansions-houston-st-families-terra-cotta.html))
    When he died in 1904, The New York Times called him ''**the Napoleon
    of** *China*.''
149. [Tara Reid](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q211082)
    ([2003/11/30/1539300](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/30/style/the-age-of-dissonance-this-city-is-skin-deep.html))

    ''South Beach is **the Madonna of** *the resort industry* --
    reinvents itself every year or so to keep up with the times and the
    trends and the demands of vacationers,'' said Dindy Yokel, a
    public-relations representative.
151. [Theodore Dreiser](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q486096)
    ([2003/12/17/1543794](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/17/books/he-loved-the-south-but-painted-its-evils-in-words.html))
    He worked on a Gulf of Mexico freighter, was arrested for vagrancy
    in Bogalusa, La., worked in a Maine bookstore, delivered milk in
    Washington, jerked orange soda in Philadelphia and stocked glassware
    in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. All the while he was mentally preparing to
    become **the Theodore Dreiser of** *his generation*.
152. [Huey Long](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q314384)
    ([2003/12/23/1545369](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/23/opinion/the-great-surrender.html))
    On the stump he seems too decent and admirable a guy to take on
    Howard Dean, **the Huey Long of** *the iPod set*.
153. [Elvis Presley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q303)
    ([2003/12/24/1545699](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/24/arts/songs-by-a-man-with-heart-mean-christmas-in-brazil.html))
    ''He could with good reason be called **the Elvis of**
    *Brazil*,'' Mr. Veloso wrote in ''Tropical Truth,'' his recently
    published autobiography.
154. [Typhoid Mary](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q238948)
    ([2003/12/25/1545895](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/25/opinion/l-a-beef-scare-adding-to-the-jitters-704725.html))
    The United States will soon discover what it feels like to be **the
    Typhoid Mary of** *the beef world*.
155. [George S. Patton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q186492)
    ([2003/12/26/1546018](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/26/sports/sports-times-sports-world-it-s-hard-forgive-behavior-actions-some-people.html))
    It is difficult to be loving and kind and generous, at this point,
    to Bob Knight, who, at the seemingly adult age of 63, envisions
    himself as **the General Patton of** *Hoops* and who still believes
    he can get away with any schoolyard obscene gesture simply because,
    well, he is Bob Knight, the General Patton of Hoops.
156. [Alice Waters](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q434513)
    ([2003/12/27/1546122](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/27/us/helen-gustafson-74-dies-championed-fine-tea-in-america.html))
    She was ''**the Alice Waters of** *the tea movement*,'' said a
    friend, Ruth Reichl, editor in chief of Gourmet magazine and former
    restaurant critic of The New York Times, in a reference to the
    founder of Chez Panisse.
157. [Davy Crockett](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q311070)
    ([2003/12/28/1546259](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/28/magazine/the-lives-they-lived-birth-of-a-vacation.html))
    He blazed a great trail for suburban pioneers, **the Davy Crockett
    of** *the Interstates*.
158. [Bill Parcells](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q364415)
    ([2003/12/28/1546283](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/28/magazine/the-lives-they-lived-head-coach.html))
    Bowman was **the Bill Parcells of** *hockey*; he had a knack for
    terrifying grown, very highly paid men and making them worry about
    what the coach would think of next.

    ([2004/01/07/1548718](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/07/dining/flavors-fresher-than-sushi.html))
    The owner of Sumile, a Japanese pop star called Miwa Yoshida (Mr.
    DeChellis describes her as ''**the Madonna of** *Japan*''), often
    sends him to cook and learn at her brother's upscale izakaya
    in Tokyo.

    The cliché of her as **the Sylvia Plath of** *photographers*,
    combined with the way her photographs direct your attention to her
    presence, can obscure the difference between what is in the pictures
    and what we might like to read into them.

    After thieves stole flowers from him recently, Mr. Price, who could
    become **the Charles Bronson of** *guacamole*, planted his hillsides
    with long-thorned finger cactus -- ''enough to completely engulf the
    valley,'' he said.
7.  [Muhammad Ali](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36107)
    ([2004/02/01/1555241](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/01/arts/dance-the-sincerest-form-of-flannery.html))

    She is **the Wilma Rudolph of** *her generation*, quite capable of
    breaking molds and barriers, becoming not only a great female
    athlete, but one of the greatest runners of all time.
9.  [Jackie Robinson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q221048)
    ([2004/02/06/1556595](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/06/movies/film-review-the-block-goes-bourgeois-and-barbers-draw-scissors.html))
    Eddie gets provocative lines, like ''The D.C. sniper is like **the
    Jackie Robinson of** *crime*,'' nuggets guaranteed to
    cause squabbles.

    Hailed in his time as ''**the Michelangelo of** *the menagerie*,''
    and today as France's greatest animalier, or portrayer of animals,
    Antoine-Louis Barye (1796-1875) applied a robust realism to his
    portrayal of beasts and reptiles as well as humans.
11. [Diane Warren](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q237354)
    ([2004/02/08/1557103](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/08/arts/and-its-worst.html))
    And the answer is pretty much Linda Perry, the former 4 Non Blondes
    singer whose work on Pink's ''Missundaztood'' has turned Ms. Perry
    into **the Diane Warren of** *the edgy set*.
12. [Igor Stravinsky](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7314)
    ([2004/02/13/1558419](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/13/movies/pop-and-jazz-guide-365661.html))
    A screening of ''Off the Charts'' will be followed by NRBQ playing
    its favorite song-poems with the saxophonist Ellery Eskelin -- son
    of Rodd Keith, **the Stravinsky of** *song-poem composers* -- and
    with the song-poem tunesmith David Fox.

    At that point, with her rafter-shaking alto and steamroller
    presence, she seemed destined to become **the Ethel Merman of** *her
    generation*, and it was fitting when she took the Merman part in a
    1987 revival of ''Anything Goes.''
14. [Ernie Isley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5394549)
    ([2004/02/15/1558923](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/15/movies/oscar-films-the-performances-in-close-up-best-actor-333646.html))
    At no point does he upstage the other actors in the film; he may be

    To these eyes, Maddux has been **the Larry Bird of** *baseball*,
    unprepossessing-appearing until you had to go one-on-one with him,
    and then there was no bottom to his bag of wiles and talents.
17. [Philippe Starck](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q316906)
    ([2004/02/22/1560626](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/22/magazine/the-new-collectibles-258490.html))
    Since 2001, Hardy has also created shoes for Balenciaga, in a close
    collaboration with the label's designer Nicolas Ghesquière that has
    finally seen him transcend his cult status to emerge as **the
    Philippe Starck of** *the stack heel*.

    ([2004/02/22/1560800](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/22/nyregion/working-atlantic-city-s-corners.html))
    ''But Arturo Gatti is **the Oscar De La Hoya of** *New
    Jersey*,'' Mr. DiBella continued, referring to the Los Angeles-based
    world super-welterweight champ, whose inspired crowds cheer
    start-to-finish at all his fights.

    Nowadays, the sax has a nostalgic quality of 1950's-era disillusion
    -- **the James Dean of** *instruments*.

    ([2004/02/29/1562506](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/29/theater/theater-shtetl-shtick.html))
    The Tevye of ''Fiddler'' is **the Yogi Berra of** *Anatevka*, a
    twinkly eyed, malapropism-spouting buffoon who carries on a running
    conversation with God that sounds like a monologue by a borscht
    belt comic.
23. [Michelangelo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5592)

    music*.

    ([2004/03/09/1564959](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/09/nyregion/fashion-diary-designers-ride-into-the-sunset-martians-invade-the-runway.html))
    To a baby boomer, the Australian Gemma Ward, the Canadian teenager
    Heather Marks or the current Italian Vogue cover girl Lisa Cant also
    bear some resemblance to the waifs painted by the kitsch master
    Margaret Keane, as well as to subjects favored by the painter John
    Currin, whom some might call **the Margaret Keane of** *the Whitney
    Biennial set*.
26. [Daniel Libeskind](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q154538)

    Minch, known by her staff as **the Imelda Marcos of** *Ryan Center*
    (her office décor is dominated by shoe-shaped ceramic collectibles),
    buys her size 6 1/2 stilettos in Puerto Rico, her destination
    whenever she takes a breather from the scramble for good health care
    for the underinsured, and in 35 percent of the cases, uninsured,
    patients who compose Ryan's client base.

    The portrait of Night-Shining White, from the idealizing brush of
    Han Gan, a leading horse painter of the Tang dynasty
    (active 742-756) -- **the George Stubbs of** *his day*, so to speak
    -- is intended to evoke a dragon in disguise, a celestial being with
    supernatural powers.
31. [Bill Gates](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5284)

    Brooding over Osborne's adventure like an implacable Greek god --
    the anti-Dionysus, perhaps -- is the ''all-powerful'' American wine
    critic Robert Parker, who sees himself as **the Ralph Nader of**
    *wine*, the incorruptible gatekeeper of the American palate.

    In his own way, Ashton was **the Shakespeare of** *ballet*, less

    ([2004/05/23/1583885](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/23/style/just-browsing-opening-13-cans-of-whoop.html))
    It's **the Pat Boone of** *energy drinks*, an upbeat, peppy blend of
    apple, pear and carrot juice tweaked with hints of this and that to
    bend it in the direction of grapefruit and strawberry.

    But now that he is a finalist for the Hart trophy as most valuable

    That he isn't really a designer but a man of many parts -- rap
    artist, record producer, St. Tropez party animal and, most recently,
    Broadway star -- is probably one reason he was on his way to
    becoming **the Susan Lucci of** *fashion*.

    Hermé, **the Serena Williams of** *French sweets*, always wears
    black, so it is no surprise that his signature sablé is blackened
    with cocoa and bittersweet chocolate and spiked with challenging,
    crunchy shards of fleur de sel.
124. [Benedict Arnold](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q298237)
    ([2004/11/07/1625157](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/07/books/review/07MARGOLI.html))
    Blacks jumped on Johnson for this, and their very virulence --
    ''Uncle Tom Johnson,'' ''**the Benedict Arnold of** *his race*'' and
    ''a jimson weed in the nostrils of those who once cheered him'' are
    only some of the epithets thrown his way -- suggests that their
    anger toward him was older and deeper than Ward represents.

    We shared Delft's wet streets with mainly Dutch tourists, drawn by
    the intimacy and beauty of its old center and probably also by
    monuments associated with William of Orange, **the George Washington

    Hapsburgs in the 16th century.

    Juan Osorio, **the Aaron Spelling of** *Mexican television*, was so
    ready to gamble on Ms. Trevi's marketability that he signed her to a

    ([2005/03/13/1656623](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/13/realestate/13habi.html))

    ([2005/03/16/1657357](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/16/dining/15army.html))

    the Year four times.

    ([2005/03/20/1658580](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/20/opinion/20dowd.html))

    ([2005/03/28/1660495](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/28/business/worldbusiness/28africa.html))
    For Felicia Mabuza-Suttle, a talk-show host who has been called
    **the Oprah Winfrey of** *South Africa*, the channel is ''the best
    news ever to come out of America about Africa.''
41. [James Earl Jones](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q203960)
    ([2005/03/31/1661134](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/31/arts/television/31comi.html))
    Well over six feet tall, muscular and shaven-headed, with a voice
    deep enough to qualify him as **the James Earl Jones of**
    *stand-up*, he commands a stage.
42. [Nick Spano](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7026238)
    ([2005/03/31/1661241](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/31/nyregion/metrocampaigns/31spano.html))

    ([2005/04/01/1661389](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/01/business/01norris.html))
    Qwest, **the Rodney Dangerfield of** *the telephone industry*, may
    mount a proxy war.
44. [Leo Tolstoy](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7243)
    ([2005/04/06/1662797](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/06/books/06bellow.html))

    ([2005/04/10/1663656](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/10/nyregion/lavalle-creates-gop-uncertainty.html))
    I don't mean to be dramatic, but I think John LaValle has been **the
    Gorbachev of** *Brookhaven*, and just like Gorbachev, his fate was
    sealed because he was a product of the same corrupt system that he
    needed to destroy.''
46. [Charles Atlas](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q368744)
    ([2005/04/10/1663822](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/10/business/yourmoney/10omah.html)) Mr.
    Schwarzenegger appeared in Army fatigues and took Mr. Buffett -- who
    may be **the Charles Atlas of** *investors* but who has the
    musculature of a chipmunk -- through a grueling workout to punish
    him for criticizing inequities in California's property tax system.
47. [François Truffaut](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q53002)

    So it takes courage, if not a touch of Brownian madness, to argue,
    as David S. Reynolds does in his absorbing new biography, ''John
    Brown, Abolitionist,'' that Brown was not **the Unabomber of** *his
    time*, but a reasonable man, well connected to his era's
    intellectual currents and a salutary force for change.
49. [Ruth Reichl](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2896645)

    EVER **the Madonna of** *cities*, Las Vegas -- once the home of the
    Rat Pack and then, briefly, a family friendly destination -- has
    once again reinvented itself for baby boomers and their echo-boomer
    offspring, both eager to spend whatever it takes for a taste of the
    good life.
51. [Leonardo da Vinci](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q762)
    ([2005/04/22/1666672](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/22/arts/design/22anti.html))

    ([2005/04/22/1666692](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/22/dining/22jour.html))
    Among the Asian cuisines that New Yorkers have embraced, Chinese

    less respect than others.

    Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is building the station.
55. [Walt Disney](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8704)
    ([2005/04/24/1667287](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/24/fashion/sundaystyles/24SHAKE.html))
    The restaurant was designed by David Rockwell, an architect and set
    designer who is **the Walt Disney of** *the New York theme dining
    world*.
56. [G. Gordon Liddy](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q952688)
    ([2005/04/26/1667895](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/26/sports/baseball/26tv.html))
    Cablevision is **the G. Gordon Liddy of** *corporations*, willing to
    hold a hand to the fire to maintain its principles.
57. [Naomi Campbell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q199369)
    ([2005/04/27/1668067](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/27/opinion/27dowd.html))
    The uncombed, untethered Mr. Bolton is fabulously operatic -- **the
    Naomi Campbell of** *the Bush administration*, ready at a moment's
    notice to beat up on underlings.
58. [Dan Quayle](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q49214)
    ([2005/04/29/1668469](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/29/arts/television/29tvwk.html))
    A black-and-white newsreel shows him bounding onto the stage at the
    Democratic National Convention as the vice-presidential nominee,
    **the Dan Quayle of** *his time*.
59. [Nicholson Baker](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1929421)
    ([2005/05/01/1668882](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/books/review/01TBR.html))
    But ''Freakonomics'' is so sly, finicky and micro-observant that the
    Indiana Jones comparison feels a little off -- Levitt is more like
    **the Nicholson Baker of** *economists*.
60. [Donald Trump](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686)
    ([2005/05/02/1669399](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/02/arts/02pari.html))

    ([2005/05/05/1670008](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/05/arts/music/05maaz.html))
    An elegant and hardy singer, Mr. Keenlyside again proved himself a
    risk-taking actor -- **the Ralph Fiennes of** *baritones*.

    ([2005/05/06/1670224](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/06/arts/movies/the-listings-may-612.html))
    NIGHT OF A THOUSAND STEVIES (Tonight) For devotees of **the Stevie
    Nicks of** /''Rhiannon'' and ''Belladonna''/ this 15th annual
    lip-synch-heavy tribute to Fleetwood Mac's songstress is a chance
    for fans to don a diaphanous shawl and join in a night of white
    winged doves and crystal worship.
63. [Donald Trump](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686)

64. [Simon Cowell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q162629)
    ([2005/05/16/1672918](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/16/business/media/16carr.html)) Ms.
    Brown, who had long been **the Simon Cowell of** *American media*,
    pointing a crooked Brit finger at the foibles of others, seems less
    interested in what she used to call ''quality heat'' than pushing
    her choices for quality political leaders (usually liberal).
65. [Tony Robbins](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q380429)
    ([2005/05/17/1673164](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/17/sports/basketball/17araton.html))
    Won't he be remembered as **the Tony Robbins of** *professional
    basketball coaches*, the self-help guru who taught Bryant, Shaquille
    O'Neal and even Michael Jordan to look within themselves for the
    secrets of the N.B.A.
66. [Jean-Pierre Léaud](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q295834)
    ([2005/05/20/1673804](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/20/arts/movies/the-listings-may-20may-26-mathieu-amalric.html)) Mr.
    Amalric, who won a 2005 César award for Best Actor for the role, has
    been called ''**the Jean-Pierre Léaud of** *the 90's*,'' and just as
    that actor became François Truffaut's nervous muse in a series of
    films spanning decades, Mr. Amalric seems destined to continue into
    the 21st century as Mr. Desplechin's filmic alter ego.
67. [Babe Ruth](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812)
    ([2005/05/22/1674615](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/22/books/review/22COVERCL.html))
    Turner's track record was dazzling -- he ''won more than 350 races,
    driving on any surface he could find,'' Edelstein writes, eventually
    earning the title of ''**the Babe Ruth of** *Stock-Car Racing*'' --
    but his off-track record, especially in light of Nascar's efforts to
    remake their drivers as gassed-up Mouseketeers, was
    downright dizzying.
68. [Courtney Love](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q222071)
    ([2005/05/22/1674628](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/22/books/review/22KENNEDY.html))
    Undaunted, she goes on to become **the Courtney Love of** *her
    time*: hanging out with Marcel Duchamp, composing poems that are
    like ''small explosions'' for The Little Review, parading through
    the streets in outrageous costumes (a car's blinking tail light for
    a bustle, a dress covered with bits of newspaper) -- and trying not
    to succumb to the madness that destroyed her mother.
69. [Derek Jeter](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q353511)
    ([2005/05/26/1675483](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/26/sports/soccer/26vecsey.html))
    The class of the organization comes from Milan's captain, Paolo
    Maldini, **the Derek Jeter of** *soccer* -- great player, great
    leader, handsome, suave.
70. [Susan Lucci](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q242936)
    ([2005/06/03/1677264](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/03/theater/theaterspecial/03tony.html))

    nominated 14 times without winning.

    ([2005/06/03/1677279](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/03/automobiles/03clubs.html))
    The new car that is most likely to usurp the Pinto as **the Rodney
    Dangerfield of** *collectible autos* could be the Pontiac Aztek.
72. [David Souter](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q472547)
    ([2005/06/03/1677350](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/03/business/03cox.html))
    In Republican and business circles, William H. Donaldson has been
    viewed as **the David Souter of** *the Securities and Exchange
    Commission*, a disappointingly independent choice who sided too
    frequently with the Democrats.
73. [Elvis Presley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q303)
    ([2005/06/05/1677662](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/05/travel/top-madrid-chefs-draw-inspiration-from-a-catalan-star.html))
    FERRAN ADRIÀ reigns as **the Elvis of** *the culinary world*, and
    his restaurant El Bulli -- found in the tiny town of Roses, two
    hours north of Barcelona by car -- is certainly its Graceland.
74. [Giorgio Armani](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q157054)
    ([2005/06/07/1678349](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/07/international/middleeast/07qum.html))
    Racks of colored robes, with neat stitches and fitting marks, fill
    the workshop of this scholarly city's most famous tailor, **the
    Giorgio Armani of** *clerical clothes*, Abolfazl Arabpour.

    ''He's known as **the Johnny Appleseed of** *the Federalist
    Society*,'' said a friend, Algert Agricola, a lawyer in Montgomery.
77. [Muhammad Ali](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36107)
    ([2005/06/10/1679013](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/10/opinion/10bellow.html))
    His large head hovers in the air at a sardonic tilt, and I think
    wryly, ''He's **the Muhammad Ali of** *conversation*: floats like a
    butterfly, stings like a bee.''
78. [Peter Paul Rubens](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5599)
    ([2005/06/10/1679091](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/10/arts/design/warhol-and-rubens-picture-them-as-peas-in-a-pod.html))
    Let's be devils and call Andy Warhol **the Rubens of** *American
    art*.

    ([2005/06/12/1679403](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/12/books/review/12ROBBINS.html))
    He uncharacteristically sank 28 of 32 free throws (a clue the night
    was like none other for a notoriously poor free-throw shooter, **the
    Shaquille O'Neal of** *his day*), and made 36 of 63 field-goal
    attempts on his typical fadeaway and finger roll.
80. [Ludwig Mies van der Rohe](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41508)
    ([2005/06/12/1679406](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/12/books/review/miss-manners-guide-to-excruciatingly-correct-behavior-aint.html))
    To a man who despairs that his fiancée wants ''one of those
    several-tiered monstrosities'' for a wedding cake, she shoots back,
    ''Who are you, **the Mies van der Rohe of** *the pastry shop*?''
81. [Mother Teresa](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30547)
    ([2005/06/12/1679657](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/12/opinion/12kristof.html))
    Reg is now dead, while Catherine is **the Mother Teresa of** *our
    time* and is long overdue for a Nobel Peace Prize.
82. [Karl Rove](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q311135)
    ([2005/06/13/1680036](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/13/nyregion/metrocampaigns/13hoboken.html))
    He is even referred to by some as **the Karl Rove of** *Hoboken*.
83. [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254)
    ([2005/06/15/1680370](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/15/world/europe/european-charter-architect-faults-chirac-for-its-rejection.html))
    As the architect of the European Union constitution, Valéry Giscard
    d'Estaing seemed at the top of his game, praised as ''**the Mozart
    of** *politics*'' and poised to go down in history as the founding
    father of a new Europe.
84. [Grace Kelly](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3925)
    ([2005/06/16/1680534](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/16/arts/television/16watc.html))
    Charlotte Jorgensen, a former dance champion who helped the actor
    John O'Hurley (J. Peterman on ''Seinfeld'') perform a cha-cha, said,
    ''I'm known as **the Grace Kelly of** *the dancing world*.''
85. [Crash Davis](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5182352)
    ([2005/06/17/1680925](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/17/sports/tennis/17tennis.html))
    He is already being called **the Crash Davis of** *tennis*, after
    the baseball catcher in the film ''Bull Durham,'' played by Kevin
    Costner, who sets a record for minor league home runs.
86. [Donald Trump](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686)
    ([2005/06/22/1682062](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/22/dining/22chod.html))
    EVEN with his 24 restaurants in nine cities from London to Los
    Angeles, even with his four homes, his private jet and his
    television appearances -- even though he can rightfully claim the
    title of being **the Donald Trump of** *the restaurant world* --
    Jeffrey Chodorow does not seem a very happy man.
87. [Charlie Parker](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103767)
    ([2005/06/24/1682532](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/24/arts/music/24jvc.html))
    In the 1970's and 80's, Jaco Pastorius was **the Charlie Parker of**
    *the electric bass*, spooking his colleagues with his brilliance; he
    was also a daredevil composer and record maker and one of the most
    imposing, volatile stage performers in jazz.
88. [Alice Waters](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q434513)
    ([2005/06/24/1682620](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/24/movies/24rome.html))
    A pioneer in the slow-zombie movement (think of him as **the Alice
    Waters of** *contemporary horror*), Mr. Romero has not joined the
    recent fad for zippy corpses, as seen in both ''28 Days Later'' and
    the remake of ''Dawn of the Dead.''

    If Doris Kearns Goodwin or David McCullough can lay claim to being
    **the Miles Davis of** *popular history*, Winchester is becoming the
    Kenny G. Where another author might rely on groundbreaking
    scholarship or at least narrative drive, Winchester, a geologist
    turned ''globe-trotting correspondent,'' favors a meandering
    approach laced with bons mots and fusty subject headings -- e.g.,
    ''The Well-Illumined Earth'' and, on the North American tectonic
    plate, ''The Plate Entire.''

    Mary Gaitskill made her reputation as a chilly chronicler of
    emotional brutality and sexual sadism, earning her the apt sobriquet

    Comparisons with Dickens, who was, in a way, **the Shakespeare of**

    quotes many foreign opinions, old and new, as well.

    ([2005/10/23/1712004](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/23/sports/baseball/23curry.html))
    But even as Clemens, **the John Wayne of** *pitchers*, gave a
    tough-guy answer about ignoring the aches that he had accumulated in
    22 seasons, he probably never imagined he would be in the clubhouse
    getting his hamstring treated after collecting six outs.

    Caravaggio (after his hometown outside Milan), was then among the

    Anointed ''**the Elvis of** *cultural theory*'' by The Chronicle of
    Higher Education, and described on his book jackets as ''the giant
    of Ljubljana,'' the 58-year-old Mr. Zizek is a jocular, motormouthed
    theorist whose critical musings on postmodernism and popular culture
    -- rich in deeply spun allusions to the likes of Alfred Hitchcock
    and David Lynch -- are inspired by the French psychoanalyst
    Jacques Lacan.

    ([2005/12/18/1725933](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/18/national/18anderson.html))
    He relished being called ''**the Paul Revere of** *journalism*'' for
    his knack for uncovering major stories first almost as much as he

    Once the reader despairs of ever finding out whether Smith was God's
    own spokesman or **the L. Ron Hubbard of** *his day*, it's possible
    to enjoy a tale that's as colorful, suspenseful and unlikely as any
    in American history.

    But it also certifies Mr. Snyder's reputation as **the Socrates of**
    *the late-night airwaves*, capable of disarming some carefully
    constructed personas with a few innocent questions.
16. [Bruce Springsteen](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1225)
    ([2006/01/25/1734499](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/25/arts/music/25joel.html))

    run-and-gun digital video and visual tone poems -- the supreme
    example being Mr. Romanek, who is **the George Lucas of** *the video

    for the arts.

    Of course, it is entirely possible that Marusek never set out to be
    **the John Updike of** *the Asimov set*; perhaps he simply intended
    ''Counting Heads'' to be an effective satire of life as we may
    someday know it, which it is, albeit one that might require
    upgrading your brain with the newest Intel microprocessor to
    comprehend fully.

    So, do Charles Dierkop, an oddly appealing actor who was **the Luis
    Guzman of** *the 70's*, and Ed Bernard, who had appeared in
    ''Shaft,'' as Royster and Styles, funky fellow detectives prone,
    like so many vintage TV characters, to such period-defining lingo as
    ''bread,'' ''jive,'' ''heavy'' and the classic ''Freeze, turkey!''
54. [John Dos Passos](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q312407)
    ([2006/04/16/1755018](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/16/theater/16merw.html))
    With ''Paradise Lost'' in 1935, his sprawling, deliberately
    ''de-Jewished'' portrait of a crumbling middle-class family, Odets
    bid to be **the John Dos Passos of** *the American stage*.
55. [Martha Stewart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234606)
    ([2006/04/20/1755647](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E7DC143FF933A15757C0A9609C8B63)) Mrs.

    ([2006/04/22/1756192](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/22/nyregion/22image.html))

    self-worth is caught up in the university's standing, though they
    deny that they see the school as **the Rodney Dangerfield of** *the
    Ivy League*.
57. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([2006/04/26/1757141](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/26/dining/26oyst.html))

58. [Bernard-Henri Lévy](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q313509)
    ([2006/04/29/1757861](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/29/technology/computer-care-packages.html))
    His 1995 book, ''Being Digital,'' cemented his reputation as **the
    Bernard-Henri Lévy of** *the digerati*: even when he was right, he
    made your eyes roll.
59. [Arnold Palmer](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9434)

    ([2006/05/07/1759704](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/books/review/07casey.html))
    A man whose daffodils and tulips compete in the Philadelphia show is

    ([2006/05/07/1759939](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/fashion/sundaystyles/07SELIGER.html))

    For summarizing Henry Petroski's importance as an explainer and
    popularizer (''Engineering a Safer, More Beautiful World, One
    Failure at a Time,'' May 2), another phrase beats ''meistersinger of
    the guild'': **the Carl Sagan of** *engineering*.

    ([2006/05/10/1760554](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/10/dining/10pour.html))
    You might call merlot **the Barry Bonds of** *wine*, a real power
    hitter that fell apart under close scrutiny.
66. [Henry Ford](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8768)
    ([2006/05/11/1760785](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/11/garden/11viktor.html))

    Connolly, whose two-hour show includes very few slow patches, has
    been called **the Robin Williams of** *Scotland*, but that's not
    really accurate.

    Edelstein, a motor-sports writer for TV Guide, chronicles the bumpy
    career of Curtis Turner (1924-70), who ran moonshine in the Virginia

    *stock-car racing*.''
69. [Sarah Bernhardt](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4605)

    LINDSAY LOHAN is **the Albert Pujols of** *her game*: consistent,
    versatile and kicking the Manolos off the competition.
72. [Linda McCartney](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q228899)
    ([2006/05/21/1763283](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/21/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/21njROADIES.html))
    Though Corey's parents, who are divorced, both attend concerts, Ms.
    O'Connell goes the extra mile: she is **the Linda McCartney of**
    *the band*, with at least 700 photos of the fledgling rockers.
73. [Chris Daughtry](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q877858)
    ([2006/05/24/1764018](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/24/arts/television/24idol.html))

    campaign*, even if his scream was louder.)
74. [Dan Brown](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7345)
    ([2006/05/26/1764359](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/26/arts/design/26giro.html))
    Mixing Christian morals with forbidden sex, the book, published in

    ([2006/05/28/1764810](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/28/arts/design/28kenn.html))
    But in interviews, a rough outline emerges that casts Mr. Colen as
    the Richard Hatch -- albeit clothed -- or at least **the Rudy Boesch
    of** *the show's contemporary-art island*, and that tends to
    make Ms. Stupak, because of her already-established art connections,
    something of a diva.
76. [Salvador Dalí](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5577)
    ([2006/05/28/1764923](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/28/automobiles/28RATFINK.html))
    Writing about Kustom Kulture in his book ''Kandy-Kolored
    Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby,'' Tom Wolfe described Roth as

77. [Jerome Bettis](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q548453)
    ([2006/06/04/1766427](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/04/sports/playmagazine/04camp.html))
    The knobby tires are two and a half inches wide, and the whole thing
    weighs 44 pounds, making it **the Jerome Bettis of** *bicycles*:
    sure-footed with steamroller-like heft.
78. [Jerry Bruckheimer](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q217037)
    ([2006/06/04/1766638](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/04/fashion/04BOITE.html))

    Such ''red flags,'' as they are sometimes called, were the meat and
    potatoes of the keynote speech on Friday night by Alex Jones, who is
    **the William Jennings Bryan of** *the 9/11 band*.
80. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)

    Balaban's next project is to translate into English Vietnam's most
    famous poem, ''The Tale of Kieu,'' by Nguyen Du, a male contemporary

    *Vietnam*.
84. [J. K. Rowling](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q34660)
    ([2006/06/16/1769404](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/16/arts/television/16stan.html))
    When **the J. K. Rowling of** *political invective* decries what she
    describes as the ''intolerance'' of the mainstream liberal media,
    it's a little like the Soviet Union complaining about oppression
    from Finland.
85. [Jon Stewart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q211987)
    ([2006/06/16/1769404](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/16/arts/television/16stan.html))
    That's mainly because CBS's David Letterman, who was **the Jon
    Stewart of** *his day*, now seems resigned to a staid second place.
86. [Harry Winston](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2522402)
    ([2006/06/17/1769614](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/17/nyregion/17bling.html))

    If Phil Mickelson sees any reason to watch a tape or a DVD of NBC's
    coverage of his Sunday meltdown at Winged Foot, he will hear himself
    savaged by Johnny Miller, **the Simon Cowell of** *golf criticism*,
    and watch his lousy play late in the final round.
89. [Larry Brown](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q380013)

    ([2006/06/23/1771196](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/23/sports/baseball/23clemens.html))
    Even though Clemens spoke positively about his performance and was
    happy that his arm and his legs felt fine, he sounded like **the
    John Wayne of** *pitchers* when he stressed that he needed to throw
    inside more.
91. [Dean Martin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q215359)
    ([2006/06/25/1771443](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/books/review/25tbr.html))
    White, who looks like a cross between Nick Nolte and James Dickey,
    is **the Dean Martin of** *this particular Rat Pack*; he usually
    delivers his routines while waving a lighted cigar and a glass
    of Scotch.
92. [Salvador Dalí](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5577)

    When he was murdered in 1992 at 32, under mysterious circumstances
    after a concert in Mexico, he became something like **the Tupac

    An elevator shaft can act as **the Typhoid Mary of** *unpleasant
    aromas*, sucking them up and distributing them throughout the
    building's byways, for instance, or a fish-frying neighbor may prop
    open a front door.
105. [Bono](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q834621)

    Whether he will become **the Bono of** *emo* is not clear, but this
    weekend at Radio City Music Hall, when Mr. Carrabba's fans join
    along in shouting his anthems, the sound should be huge.
106. [Dr. Dre](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6078)

    true artist.

    When Elisabeth Hasselbeck, **the Zeppo Marx of** *the foursome*,
    said she donned a bathing suit to take a bath with her baby
    daughter, Ms. O'Donnell went wide-eyed at her prudery and recalled

    In 12 years in Australian rules football, Graham, 32, was **the
    Curtis Martin of** *Geelong*, commanding the lion's share
    of attention.
113. [Bono](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q834621)
    ([2006/09/08/1788260](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/08/business/media/08fcc.html))
    He is also taken up by Mohammad (Charles Daniel Sandoval), a
    successful Pakistani businessman who recognizes ''**the Bono of**
    *Lahore*,'' as he hyperbolically calls Ahmad, and offers to help
    restart his musical career.
114. [Mahatma Gandhi](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1001)
    ([2006/09/08/1788300](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/08/us/08liberties.html))
    ''My favorite,'' he said as he recalled one note, ''was that I was
    '**the Gandhi of** *Portland*.'

    ([2006/09/12/1789368](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/12/business/smallbusiness/12multi.html))
    ''They are kind of like **the Ken Burns of** *interactive media*,''
    said Jeff Stafford, the technology director for Communications Arts
    magazine, a Menlo Park, Calif., publication that oversees an annual
    interactive design awards competition that Second Story has
    dominated in recent years in the Info-Design category.
116. [Harry Winston](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2522402)
    ([2006/09/12/1789409](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/12/fashion/shows/12DIARY.html))
    ''It was a present from 50 when I got out of jail a year ago,''
    said Mr. Yayo, a member of the G-Unit, referring to a wristwatch
    roughly the scale and diameter of a hockey puck, covered with pavé
    diamonds and designed by Jacob Arabo, **the Harry Winston of** *the
    bling-bling set*.
117. [Willie Horton](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8021572)
    ([2006/09/13/1789678](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/13/opinion/13dowd.html))

    ([2006/09/17/1790422](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/17/books/review/Wolff2.t.html))
    If there were any doubt, Golden's muckraking investigation -- he's
    **the Ida Tarbell of** *college admissions* -- reveals that almost
    every word uttered by representatives of the top colleges about the
    care and nuance and science of the much vaunted admissions process
    is bunk.
119. [Ralph Nader](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q193156)
    ([2006/09/22/1791899](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/22/us/politics/22texas.html))
    With even 2 percent of the vote, Mr. Werner could pull enough from
    another candidate to make a difference, becoming **the Ralph Nader
    of** *Texas*, 2006.
120. [George Balanchine](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q310184)
    ([2006/09/24/1792245](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/arts/dance/24howa.html))

    ([2006/09/24/1792574](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/sports/football/24seahawks.html))

    ([2006/09/28/1793222](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/28/world/asia/28taiwan.html))
    But Mr. Shih, a man sometimes described as **the Nelson Mandela of**
    *Taiwan*, is now leading a movement that, as he acknowledged in an
    interview, is heavily composed of Nationalists, his longtime enemies
    who once ran the country under martial law.
124. [Trisha Brown](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q460833)
    ([2006/10/01/1793841](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02EFD91F31F932A35753C1A9609C8B63))
    ODILE DUBOC is **the Trisha Brown of** *French contemporary dance*,
    much admired during the late 1980's and early 90's for an
    autodidactic style that -- unlike the work of most of her
    contemporaries -- focused strongly on pure movement.
125. [Bruce Springsteen](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1225)
    ([2006/10/08/1795741](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/08/nyregion/thecity/08scri.html))
    In the eyes of Judy Kastin, a society member and a professional
    calligrapher who teaches the craft to grade-school children in Long
    Island, Mr. Jackson is **the Bruce Springsteen of** *the quill and
    vellum set*.
126. [Homer](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6691)
    ([2006/10/10/1796120](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/10/science/10eisn.html))

    *the insect world*.
127. [Jay Z](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q62766)
    ([2006/10/12/1796555](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/12/arts/music/12sann.html))
    (Vibe magazine reaffirmed Jay-Z's role as a hip-hop yardstick by
    putting T. I. on the cover, accompanied by the question, ''Is he
    **the Jay-Z of** *the South*?'')

    ([2006/10/13/1796734](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/13/arts/design/13comi.html))
    As for Mr. Crumb, he's still **the Picasso of** *comics*: the
    unavoidable influence on all younger artists.
129. [Elvis Presley](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q303)
    ([2006/10/15/1797185](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/arts/music/15waki.html)) Mr.

    ([2006/10/20/1798456](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/20/arts/movies/the-listings-oct-20oct26.html))
    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday) Robert White, the Irish tenor,
    is **the George Hamilton of** *the vocal world*: an unbowed,
    ageless veteran.
131. [Beau Brummell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q561019)
    ([2006/10/22/1798941](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/22/books/review/Whitehead.t.html))
    Powers has chosen a brain disorder that doubles as handy metaphor
    for human miscommunication of all kinds, and then added one more
    element to the mix, in the form of Gerald Weber -- ''the natty
    neuroscientist,'' ''**the Beau Brummell of** *brain research*'' --
    who comes to town to lend a hand, or at least gather material for
    his collection of psychological oddities.
132. [Wieland Wagner](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60465)
    ([2006/10/22/1799005](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/22/movies/22gold.html))

    ([2006/10/25/1799723](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/25/sports/ncaafootball/25roberts.html))
    But how do you bump off **the Wilford Brimley of** *coaches*?
134. [Giorgio Morandi](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q309618)
    ([2006/10/27/1800043](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/27/arts/design/27mard.html))
    Such comparisons have earned Mr. Marden a kind of flame-keeper
    status -- something like **the Giorgio Morandi of** *radical
    abstraction*, a maker of inordinately beautiful, exquisitely made
    (and expensive) artworks.
135. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)

    ([2006/11/03/1801765](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/03/arts/design/03anti.html))
    ''Hanns Weinberg was **the Joseph Duveen of** *antique porcelain*,''
    said Ms. Beiny, comparing her grandfather to the flamboyant
    early-20th-century dealer who sold old master paintings to
    American tycoons.
138. [Julia Roberts](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40523)
    ([2006/11/05/1802313](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/05/movies/moviesspecial/05break.html))
    KNOWN as **the Julia Roberts of** *Spain*, Paz Vega made her
    American debut two years ago in the big-budget film ''Spanglish.''
139. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([2006/11/06/1802795](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/06/world/europe/06italy.html))

    Liège, Belgium, but who is considered by his fans to be **the

    little bit too cold, and it is different from Vegas, but I still
    like the town.''

141. [Marilyn Monroe](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4616)
    ([2006/11/08/1803158](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/arts/music/08emma.html))
    Curvaceous, cuddlesome and irresistibly charming, the ''Introduction
    and Allegro'' is something like **the Marilyn Monroe of** *the
    classical-music repertory*.
142. [Mark Twain](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7245)
    ([2006/11/10/1803630](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/10/business/10diesel.html))

    A mighty wind, though, is just the beginning of basic gross-out, and
    Santiago Segura is **the Hieronymus Bosch of** *gross*.

    ([2006/11/13/1804470](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/13/arts/whats-on-tonight.html))
    This documentary looks at some of the celebrities whose faces have
    replaced the ubiquitous images of the fallen leader, including Majed
    Yassin, an up-and-coming comic, and Shaima Zubeir, who is sometimes
    called **the Oprah of** *Iraq*.

147. [Michael Vick](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q505431)
    ([2006/12/02/1808794](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/02/sports/football/02rhoden.html))

    ([2006/12/03/1808861](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/books/review/Handy.t.html))
    Otherwise, he's **the George Washington of** *popular culture*:
    familiar but indistinct, ubiquitous but remote.
149. [William Shakespeare](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q692)
    ([2006/12/04/1809466](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/04/washington/04gala.html)) Mr.

    ([2006/12/04/1809508](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/04/nyregion/04stone.html))
    For Mr. Stone, the history lesson began five years ago, when, as a
    new principal, he squeezed \$40,000 out of an already tight budget
    to open a weight-training room for the Indians, which had been **the
    Rodney Dangerfield of** *teams in the city*, and hired a storied
    former high school running back, Altarik White, as coach to
    lead them.

    ([2006/12/08/1810379](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/08/sports/soccer/08araton.html))
    Years before her mother would co-write a book with Anson Dorrance --
    **the John Wooden of** *women's college soccer*, whose Tar Heel
    program spawned, among others, Mia Hamm -- Yael was insisting that
    was where she would go.

    ([2006/12/10/1810595](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/books/review/Burrough.t.html))
    But Lawson, presumably viewing Oldham as **the Ken Jennings of**
    *criminalia*, falls prey to the common trap of letting only the
    caged canary sing.

    ([2006/12/11/1811150](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/11/books/11masl.html))
    Though Foujita had a fashion sense that made him look like **the
    Elton John of** *Montparnasse* (he favored earrings, bangs and
    show-stopping homemade costumes), and though he is seen here hand in
    hand with a male Japanese friend during their shared tunic-wearing
    phase, he is viewed by Ms. Birnbaum strictly as a lady-killer.

    Genre buffs will enjoy seeing Liu Chia-liang, the veteran director
    (''The Eight Diagram Pole Fighter,'' ''The 36th Chamber
    of Shaolin'') who might be described as **the John Ford of** *Kung
    Fu*, in a leading role, though the film's other pleasures
    are sparse.

    ([2007/02/04/1823588](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/04/magazine/04wwlnsafire.t.html))
    In April 1976, Clifford Terry wrote in The Chicago Tribune about the
    actress Louise Lasser, whose role in the TV series ''Mary Hartman,
    Mary Hartman'' was ''becoming a media darling, sort of **the Margaux
    Hemingway of** *the Crock Pot set*.''
12. [Nelson Mandela](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8023)
    ([2007/02/04/1823794](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/04/business/yourmoney/04boss.html))

    ([2007/02/06/1824127](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/06/books/06kaku.html))

    ([2007/02/25/1828518](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/25/style/tmagazine/25tfuture.html))
    While it's tempting to dismiss him as **the Shirley MacLaine of**
    *fashion*, Mugler moonwalks it like he talks it and has steadfastly
    adhered to his fantastical aesthetic since the early 1970s.
19. [Al Roker](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3240869)
    ([2007/02/25/1828625](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/25/arts/music/25ratliff.html))

    When **the Tiger Woods of** *politics* goes to a civil rights

    ([2007/03/11/1831985](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/books/review/Crime.t.html))
    Reginald Hill's crude and canny policeman (''**the Marcus Aurelius
    of** *mid-Yorkshire*'' to those who love him) is nothing less than a
    force of nature in these idiosyncratic procedurals, and the act of
    terrorism that has his life hanging by a thread may pose an even
    graver threat to the natural order of his kind of genre novel.
31. [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254)
    ([2007/03/13/1832608](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/13/science/13prof.html))

    ([2007/03/15/1833173](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/15/sports/ncaabasketball/15vecsey.html))
    The real issue is who will be **the Carmelo Anthony of** *this
    year*, a reference to the man among boys who led Syracuse to its
    national title in 2003, as a freshman, and then turned pro.

    ([2007/03/16/1833380](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/16/sports/ncaabasketball/16vecsey.html))

    Wilkens of** *the next decade*.
35. [Louis Pasteur](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q529)
    ([2007/03/18/1833651](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/18/books/review/Kirn.t.html))
    He acts as if he were **the Louis Pasteur of** *poverty*,
    identifying its forms for the first time through the lens of some
    sociological microscope.
36. [John Pawson](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1036920)
    ([2007/03/22/1834641](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/22/fashion/22CRITIC.html))
    The pieces are undeniably chic, especially those by David Netto
    (**the John Pawson of** *the nursery set*) and Ooba, whose
    Eames-like bassinette (\$600) could be part of MoMA's
    permanent collection.
37. [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254)
    ([2007/03/24/1835075](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/24/obituaries/24stein.html))
    But if there was honor in being **the Mozart of** ''*The Mole
    People*'' (1956), there was little glory.
38. [Donatella Versace](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q229437)
    ([2007/03/25/1835279](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/travel/tmagazine/03get.sourcing.t.html))
    For Laura Sorbatti, Marco's cousin and the owner of the firm Icas,
    whose love of hot pants and sunlamps has made her **the Donatella
    Versace of** *the hat world*, that chapeau is a hideous cap with the
    word ''gold'' picked out in rhinestones.
39. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([2007/03/28/1836163](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/28/books/28grim.html))
    Each factory has a basketball team, and Mr. Thomas, a first-round
    draft pick, emerges as **the Michael Jordan of** *the South Korean
    penal system*.
40. [Meryl Streep](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q873)
    ([2007/04/01/1837057](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/01/style/tmagazine/04get.samurai.tst.t.html))
    I wanted **the Meryl Streep of** *toasters*, a Hepburn; either
    would do.
41. [Alice Waters](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q434513)
    ([2007/04/04/1837956](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/04/dining/04city.html))
    Although Gavin Newsom, the mayor of San Francisco, recently weighed
    in on the 2007 Farm Bill and many mayors have taken up the
    anti-obesity cause, no mayor of a large urban city has stood up and
    become, in essence, **the Alice Waters of** *city food politics*.
42. [Monty Hall](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q936132)
    ([2007/04/09/1839119](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/09/business/media/09adcol.html))
    Miles S. Nadal, **the Monty Hall of** *Madison Avenue*, is at it
    again, doing what he loves to do best: making deals.
43. [Wilhelm Furtwängler](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q57285)
    ([2007/04/10/1839266](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/10/arts/music/10pass.html))
    Sometimes his spacious timing and his feel for musical architecture
    make him seem **the Wilhelm Furtwängler of** *early-music
    conductors*.
44. [Michelangelo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5592)
    ([2007/04/12/1839640](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/12/fashion/12GUNN.html)) Mr.
    Gunn is **the Michelangelo of** *the form*.
45. [Will Rogers](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q457840)
    ([2007/04/13/1839862](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/13/theater/reviews/13wind.html))
    But he doesn't coast on the plain-spoken wisdom of a character
    presented as **the Will Rogers of** *jurisprudence*.
46. [Leni Riefenstahl](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q55415)
    ([2007/04/13/1839968](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/13/washington/13diplo.html))
    In a March 28 op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal, she
    warned Mr. Spielberg that he could ''go down in history as **the
    Leni Riefenstahl of** *the Beijing Games*,'' a reference to a German
    filmmaker who made Nazi propaganda films.
47. [Ridley Scott](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q56005)
    ([2007/04/15/1840317](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/movies/15mcgr.html)) Mr.
    Lawrence, whose previous movie was ''Lantana,'' an Altmanesque story
    of multiple strands about four unhappy couples, is **the Ridley
    Scott of** *Australia*, the country's most successful director of
    television commercials.
48. [Albert Pujols](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q148726)
    ([2007/04/15/1840597](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/sports/baseball/15cheer.html))
    ''He is **the Albert Pujols of** *fantasy sports*, a player who
    consistently produces, a player who is money in the bank.''
49. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([2007/04/17/1841042](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/17/sports/hockey/17devils.html))
    Billed as **the Michael Jordan of** *hockey* by a former Lightning
    owner, Lecavalier appeared to be on a career path more like Sam
    Bowie's, his 37 points in 76 games in his fourth season seeming to
    cement his underachieving status.
50. [Isadora Duncan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q483512)
    ([2007/04/20/1841510](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/20/arts/design/20anci.html))
    It's a small bronze sculpture, not nine inches tall, **the Isadora
    Duncan of** *ancient Alexandria*.
51. [Tiger Woods](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q10993)
    ([2007/04/22/1842189](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/business/yourmoney/22goods.html)) Mr.

    ([2007/04/22/1842224](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/weekinreview/22wong.html))
    He has become a great improviser, **the Miles Davis of** *the war*.
53. [Henry Ford](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8768)
    ([2007/04/24/1842575](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/24/business/24road.html))

    ([2007/04/30/1844006](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/30/books/30masl.html)) Mr.
    Browne also points out that when he introduced Mr. Zevon to an
    audience as ''**the Ernest Hemingway of** *the twelve-string
    guitar*,'' Mr. Zevon said he was more like Charles Bronson.
56. [Alfred Hitchcock](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7374)
    ([2007/05/02/1844502](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/02/sports/baseball/02roberts.html))
    Clomid is **the Alfred Hitchcock of** *drugs*, with its profile in
    at least one scene of every baseball steroid saga.
57. [Michael Jordan](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421)
    ([2007/05/03/1844722](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/03/sports/othersports/03boxing.html))

    ([2007/05/06/1845209](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/books/review/0506bb-paperback.html))
    ''Once the reader despairs of ever finding out whether Smith was
    God's own spokesman or **the L. Ron Hubbard of** *his day*, it's
    possible to enjoy a tale that's as colorful, suspenseful and
    unlikely as any in American history,'' Walter Kirn wrote here.
59. [Augustine of Hippo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8018)
    ([2007/05/13/1846872](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/books/review/Mallon-t.html))
    It has always been convenient to see John Donne (1572-1631) as
    **the St. Augustine of** *English letters*, made priestly and pure
    in his own good time, and not too soon to have produced the brainy
    carnal thrustings of his early love poems.
60. [Zsa Zsa Gabor](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q207405)
    ([2007/05/17/1847901](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/17/garden/17chickens.html))

    ([2007/05/20/1848574](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/arts/television/20tvcol.html))
    THE SECRET LIFE OF MRS. BEETON (13, 49) Anna Madeley plays Isabella
    Beeton, whose ''Book of Household Management'' sold millions of

    ([2007/05/20/1848597](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/movies/20kehr.html))
    Even the death of Bambi's mother pales in comparison to the bloody
    war between a mining camp and the resident spirits of a mountain
    forest at the center of Hayao Miyazaki's ''Princess Mononoke,'' a
    1997 film by the animator most often called **the Walt Disney of**
    *Japan*.
64. [P. T. Barnum](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766)
    ([2007/05/21/1849039](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/21/movies/21cann.html))

    longer runs the entire circus directly from the spotlight.

    ([2007/05/27/1850120](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/arts/design/27fiel.html))
    You could think of him as **the Ted Turner of** *great moments in
    sports history*, except that Mr. Kreindler doesn't rely on
    computerized colorization but instead conducts painstaking research
    to ensure that the hues he chooses are accurate.
66. [P. T. Barnum](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766)
    ([2007/06/01/1851208](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/01/travel/escapes/01Lecture.html)) Mr.
    Johnson, who had been a crew member on Jack London's ill-fated 1907
    voyage on the Snark, was **the P. T. Barnum of** *the lecture
    circuit* and one of the earliest adventure-film makers.
67. [Johnny Appleseed](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675)
    ([2007/06/03/1851623](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/books/review/Teresi-t.html))
    In 1993, he attended a lecture by Terence McKenna, the ''geeky
    American'' who became **the Johnny Appleseed of** *psilocybin*.
68. [Ansel Adams](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60809)
    ([2007/06/10/1853443](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/10/travel/10cultured-gt.html))
    A 52-year-old photographer from Little Rock, Ark., Mr. McDermott may
    be **the Ansel Adams of** *Angkor*.
69. [Adolf Hitler](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q352)
    ([2007/06/10/1853459](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/10/magazine/10payne-t.html))
    (''LeftyHenry,'' a recent poster on a political blog, was less
    subtle in his criticism; he called Payne ''**the Hitler of**
    *American academics*.'')
70. [Michael Brown](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q336303)
    ([2007/06/11/1853778](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/11/opinion/11mon2.html)) Mr.
    Gonzales is **the Michael Brown of** *the Justice Department*,
    smilingly presiding over incompetence, chaos and malfeasance, while
    President Bush insists that he is doing a heck of a job.
71. [Dick Wolf](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q550381)
    ([2007/06/12/1853926](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/12/arts/television/12lear.html))
    Denis Leary would seem an unlikely candidate to become **the Dick
    Wolf of** *dark*, morally muddied TV series about firefighters, cops
    and lawyers -- and perhaps no more so than on a morning last week on
    an Upper East Side playground.
72. [Arnold Schwarzenegger](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2685)
    ([2007/06/13/1854107](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/dining/reviews/13wine.html))
    Aldo called it **the Arnold Schwarzenegger of** *zweigelts*, and not
    coincidentally it was the most expensive zweigelt in the tasting,
    at \$28.
73. [Greta Garbo](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5443)
    ([2007/06/13/1854256](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/opinion/13dowd.html))
    We'll have to wait to see if David Chase, **the Garbo of**
    *goombahs* now pursued by a feral beast of disappointed ''Sopranos''
    fans, is feeling as paranoid and thin-skinned as the two Tonys, and
    as deeply surprised by the consequences of his actions.
74. [Simon Cowell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q162629)
    ([2007/06/16/1854714](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/16/arts/television/16tvcol.html))
    (She is billed as **the Simon Cowell of** *matchmaking*.)
75. [Bob Barker](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q381178)
    ([2007/06/18/1855371](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/18/arts/television/18stan.html))
    So it's not surprising that Simon Schama, a Columbia University
    professor, is turning into **the Bob Barker of** *art criticism*, a
    genial television host who excitedly invites viewers to come on down
    to high culture.
76. [Paul Revere](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q327071)
    ([2007/06/19/1855557](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/19/science/earth/19conv.html))
    Time magazine once nicknamed him ''**the Paul Revere of** *the
    environmental movement*.''
