* "the ... of" Vossantos
** preliminary note
With our initial exploratory approach we were able to cover a wide
variety of Vossantos but clearly missed some, as an analysis of some
[[file:../examples/br.org#examples][examples]] shows. Therefore, we thought about simplified patterns which
just match the source, for instance:
#+BEGIN_SRC
  (a|the) (next|new|future|would-be)? ([A-Z][a-z]+ ){1,3} of
#+END_SRC

This pattern would not match the following examples from the NYT
corpus:
- "the Mick Jagger or Michael Jordan of"
- "the Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson of"
- "She could be the Michael Jordan that women's basketball hasn't yet had"
- "He has not been the Michael Jordan in the debates"
- "he was the Babe Ruth, the Michael Jordan, the Wayne Gretzky of racing"
- "if Mel Gibson really were Michelangelo of his generation"
- names which contain lower-case terms (e.g., "van Gogh")
- adjectives that further describe the target, e.g., "the abused
  pint-size Michelangelo of"

This shows the difficulty to find a good balance between recall and
precision. We limited ourselves to the most basic pattern "the
... of", where "..."  represents up to five words which match a
Wikidata entity.

** finding source candidates in the corpus
We search for sentences which contain the pattern
~\\bthe\\s(\\w+\\s+){1,5}?of\\b~:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
  for year in $(seq 1987 2007); do
    # searches for \\bthe\\s(\\w+\\s+){1,5}?of\\b
    ./theof.py nyt_corpus_${year}.tar.gz > theof_${year}.tsv
  done
#+END_SRC

Allowing up to five words (both capitalised and not) adds noise, e.g.,
- "the other is the Maggie Smith of"
- "referred to the writer as the Clifford Irving of baseball"
- "the past are the David Brinkley of"
- "the Pope was the Madonna of"
which causes the entities in those strings to not match. After
extending ~check_wikidata.py~, we can run the extraction.

** most frequent candidates
In the NYT corpus we find 575711 hits for 1987 alone, which comprise
163565 phrases, the ten most frequent ones are the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # echo hits $(cat theof_1987.tsv | wc -l)
  awk -F'\t' '{print $2}' theof_1987.tsv| sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
#+END_SRC

| count | phrase            |
|-------+-------------------|
|  7205 | the end of        |
|  6540 | the University of |
|  4493 | the number of     |
|  3239 | the sale of       |
|  3239 | the rest of       |
|  2451 | the use of        |
|  2233 | the kind of       |
|  2154 | the son of        |
|  1961 | the age of        |
|  1939 | the president of  |

This clearly shows that the approach needs to be improved. Our idea is
to match the source candidates in the phrases against a list of person
names from Wikidata.

** identifying source candidates in Wikidata
This section describes how to extract a list of names from
Wikidata. We focus on items which have the [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P31][instance of]] property [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5][human]].

*** item has "instance of" property "human"

SPARQL query to retrieve all instances of [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5][human]]:
#+BEGIN_SRC sparql
  SELECT ?item ?itemLabel WHERE
  {
    ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q5 .                  # instance of human
    SERVICE wikibase:label {               # ... include the labels
      bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en"
    }
  }
#+END_SRC

Dowloading the data:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
  curl \
      --header "Accept: text/tab-separated-values" \
      --output wikidata_humans.tsv \
      --globoff \
"https://query.wikidata.org/sparql?query=SELECT%20%3Fitem%20%3FitemLabel%20WHERE%0A%20%20{%0A%20%20%20%20%3Fitem%20wdt%3AP31%20wd%3AQ5%20.%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20instance%20of%20human%0A%20%20%20%20SERVICE%20wikibase%3Alabel%20{%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20...%20include%20the%20labels%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20bd%3AserviceParam%20wikibase%3Alanguage%20%22en%22%0A%20%20%20%20}%0A%20%20}"
#+END_SRC

Checking the result:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  wc -l wikidata_humans.tsv
#+END_SRC

: 139649 wikidata_humans.tsv
Clearly some are missing here!

Let us try to get them without a label:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
  curl \
      --header "Accept: text/tab-separated-values" \
      --output wikidata_humans_wo_labels.tsv \
      --globoff \
"https://query.wikidata.org/sparql?query=SELECT%20%3Fitem%20%3FitemLabel%20WHERE%0A%20%20{%0A%20%20%20%20%3Fitem%20wdt%3AP31%20wd%3AQ5%20.%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20instance%20of%20human%0A%20%20}"
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  wc -l wikidata_humans_wo_labels.tsv
#+END_SRC

: 3455229 wikidata_humans_wo_labels.tsv

This looks much better. Is there a way to get a label for all of them?

With the [[https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikidata_Toolkit][Wikidata Toolkit]] and some Java code:
#+BEGIN_SRC java
  public void processItemDocument(final ItemDocument itemDocument) {
      // find an instance of "human"
      if (itemDocument.hasStatementValue("P31", Datamodel.makeWikidataItemIdValue("Q5"))) {
          final ItemIdValue itemId = itemDocument.getItemId();
          final MonolingualTextValue label = itemDocument.getLabels().get("en");
          if (label != null) {
              buf.write(csvEscape(itemId.getId()) + "\t" + csvEscape(label.getText()));
              // add aliases
              final List<MonolingualTextValue> aliases = itemDocument.getAliases().get("en");
              if (aliases != null) {
                  for (final MonolingualTextValue alias : aliases) {
                      buf.write("\t" + csvEscape(alias.getText()));
                  }
              }
              buf.write("\n");
          }
      }
  }
#+END_SRC
it is possible:
: Found 3454611 matching items after scanning 26132045 items.

Of those, 2801931 have a label:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  wc -l wikidata_humans.tsv
#+END_SRC

: 2801931 wikidata_humans.tsv

With the Java code we also extracted aliases for the names (e.g.,
"Mozart" for [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254][Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]) to enable matching against
non-complete names.

We will use that file in the sequel.

*** "fictional character"
Later, we would like to include [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q95074][fictional character]]. We can retrieve
all instances of any subclass of fictional character with this SPARQL
query:
#+BEGIN_SRC sparql
  SELECT ?item ?itemLabel WHERE
  {
    ?item (wdt:P31/wdt:P279*) wd:Q95074. # instance of any subclass of fictional character
    SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en". }
  }
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
  curl \
      --header "Accept: text/tab-separated-values" \
      --output wikidata_fictional_characters.tsv \
      --globoff \
"https://query.wikidata.org/sparql?query=SELECT%20%3Fitem%20%3FitemLabel%20WHERE%20{%0A%20%20%3Fitem%20%28wdt%3AP31%2Fwdt%3AP279*%29%20wd%3AQ95074.%0A%20%20SERVICE%20wikibase%3Alabel%20{%20bd%3AserviceParam%20wikibase%3Alanguage%20%22en%22.%20}%0A}"
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  wc -l wikidata_fictional_characters.tsv
#+END_SRC

: 46227 wikidata_fictional_characters.tsv
Seems reasonable.

** matching the phrases against the Wikidata candidates

We experiment first with the data from 1987 and match all sources in
the "the ... of" phrases against the Wikidata list of humans:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
  ./check_wikidata.py theof_1987.tsv wikidata_humans.tsv > theof_1987_wd.tsv
#+END_SRC

How many (distinct) phrases do remain?
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  wc -l theof_1987_wd.tsv
  awk -F'\t' '{print $3}' theof_1987_wd.tsv | sort -u | wc -l
#+END_SRC

| 2880 | theof_1987_wd.tsv |
|  371 | distinct phrases  |

Which are the most frequent ones?
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  awk -F'\t' '{print $3}' theof_1987_wd.tsv | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
#+END_SRC

| freq | phrase          |
|------+-----------------|
|  764 | the House of    |
|  316 | the wife of     |
|  225 | the Church of   |
|  216 | the Hall of     |
|  122 | the Bill of     |
|   83 | the Freedom of  |
|   77 | the Governor of |
|   59 | the Duke of     |
|   53 | the King of     |
|   45 | the Sultan of   |
|      |                 |
So most of those are covered by rather unusual "names".

** blacklisting names
We put such rather unusual "names" into a [[file:blacklist.tsv][blacklist]]:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  awk -F'\t' '{print $3}' theof_1987_wdfiltered.tsv | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > blacklist.tsv
#+END_SRC
which we manually clean up.

Now we repeat the analysis:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
  export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
  ./check_wikidata.py --blacklist blacklist.tsv theof_1987.tsv wikidata_humans.tsv > theof_1987_wd_bl.tsv
#+END_SRC

How many results did we get?
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  wc -l theof_1987_wd_bl.tsv
  awk -F'\t' '{print $3}' theof_1987_wd_bl.tsv | sort -u | wc -l
#+END_SRC

| 104 | theof_1987_wd_bl.tsv |
|  88 |                      |

Which were the most frequent ones?
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  awk -F'\t' '{print $3}' theof_1987_wd_bl.tsv | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
#+END_SRC

| freq | phrase                 |
|------+------------------------|
|    4 | the Horatio Alger of   |
|    4 | the Frank Sinatra of   |
|    3 | the Woody Allen of     |
|    3 | the Madonna of         |
|    2 | the Tom Seaver of      |
|    2 | the Pete Rose of       |
|    2 | the Joan Baez of       |
|    2 | the Jackie Robinson of |
|    2 | the Groucho Marx of    |
|    2 | the Abraham Lincoln of |

Much better! Let us repeat this process for all other years.

*** TODO criteria
Since the blacklist is quite long
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  wc -l blacklist.tsv
#+END_SRC
: 1268 blacklist.tsv
it is worthwhile to describe how we created it: We have iteratively
examined the source candidates for the years and added names to the
blacklist which were not obviously (famous) people. This mainly
affected names with just one word
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  grep " " blacklist.tsv | wc -l
#+END_SRC
: 61
which often are also English nouns like house, hall, church, bill.

** processing all remaining years
*** matching against Wikidata without blacklist
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
  export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
  for year in $(seq 1987 2007); do
    ./check_wikidata.py theof_${year}.tsv wikidata_humans.tsv > theof_${year}_wd.tsv
  done
#+END_SRC
Now we have restricted the list to phrases which contain a source that
matches a Wikidata item with an "instance of" property of "human".

*** extending the blacklist
**** Step 1
We create an initial blacklist using the terms from the first year:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
  export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
  ./check_wikidata.py theof_1987.tsv wikidata_humans.tsv |\
      awk -F'\t' '{print $4}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > bl.tsv
#+END_SRC

**** Step 2
Now we edit ~bl.tsv~ to remove all entities which are OK ... and then
we cleanup and append to the blacklist which we then commit:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
  sed -e "s/^ *//" -e "s/ /\t/" bl.tsv | awk -F'\t' '{print $2"\t"$1}' >> blacklist.tsv
#  git commit blacklist.tsv -m"+1987"
#+END_SRC

**** Step 3
We extract new candidates for our blacklist using the next year:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
  export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
  # current year (increment)
  YEAR=1988
  LAST_YEAR=$((YEAR-1))

  # use the blacklist we had created previously to create a
  # blacklist-cleaned file
  ./check_wikidata.py -b blacklist.tsv theof_${LAST_YEAR}.tsv wikidata_humans.tsv > theof_${LAST_YEAR}_wd_bl.tsv

  # extend the blacklist by all previous positive terms (such that we do
  # not have to remove them again)
  cp blacklist.tsv blacklist_lybl.tsv
  for iy in $(seq 1987 $LAST_YEAR); do
      awk -F'\t' '{print $3}' theof_${iy}_wd_bl.tsv | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | \
          sed -e "s/^ *//" -e "s/ the /\t/" -e "s/ of$//" | awk -F'\t' '{print $2"\t"$1}' \
                                                                >> blacklist_lybl.tsv
  done

  # now we extract only the new hits
  ./check_wikidata.py -b blacklist_lybl.tsv theof_${YEAR}.tsv wikidata_humans.tsv |\
      awk -F'\t' '{print $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > bl.tsv
#+END_SRC

... and repeat this for the next year (goto Step 2).

** format data for analysis
Put everything into this org file:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
  export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
  rm newR.org
  for year in $(seq 1987 2007); do
    echo "**" $year >> newR.org
    ./tsv2org.py theof_${year}_wda_bl.tsv >> newR.org
    echo >> newR.org
  done
#+END_SRC

Merge with existing ~README.org~:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ./org.py --merge newR.org README.org  > newREADME.org
#+END_SRC

** TODO manual post-processing
- detection of false positives
  - how?
- repairing Wikidata links
  - e.g., from [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4865108][Bart Simpson, the Canadian film director]], to [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5480][Bart

    from [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q62095][Johann Andreas Wagner]] to [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1511][Richard Wagner]] (the former was
    selected because his surname is provided as "Also known as"
    alternative in Wikidata)

  - exact same sentence but different article
  - same phrase/similar sentence in same/different article
- adding markup for modifier

- TODO :: For sentences containing several Vossantos only one source

Robert:
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123867][Marquis de Sade]] (1993/09/26/0636952) When we introduced Word in October 1983, in its first incarnation it was dubbed *the Marquis de Sade of* word processors, which was not altogether unfair.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103846][Groucho Marx]] (1987/09/27/0077726) But the tide eventually shifted, partly because the supreme materialist of physics, Richard Feynman of the California Institute of Technology, a man once described as *the Groucho Marx of* physics, turned the quest for nuclear substructure into a cause celebre.

Doctorow]] (1987/01/31/0008693) Just as the Czechoslovak composer incorporated such themes into his ''New World'' Symphony, so Mr. Skvorecky, a Czechoslovak author, brings to this ''first attempt at writing a historical and biographical novel'' echoes of American writers of the period from Bret Harte to William Dean Howells, with a nod to *the E. L. Doctorow of* ''Ragtime.''+
13. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9358][Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1987/02/08/0011389) He is something like a parody of Nietzsche, not *the Nietzsche of* ''The Genealogy of Morals'' but of ''Ecce Homo.''+

19. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q209050][Jan Brueghel the Elder]] (1987/02/13/0012870) Subjects like ''Flora'' and ''The Four Senses'' cause him to come on like *the Velvet Brueghel of* his set, putting his trust in multiplicity of subject matter and a high degree of finish.

21. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5443][Greta Garbo]] (1987/02/28/0017372) It was enough to make people wonder if McReynolds would adjust to the customary passion of the Mets or become *the Greta Garbo of* New York baseball, wanting to be alone in a city and business where it was not easy to be alone.
22. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q295107][Mr. T]] (1987/03/01/0017607) President Reagan is said to be a great fan of the ''McLaughlin Group'' and has called Mr. McLaughlin ''*the Mr. T of* TV journalism.''

25. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q152505][Leonard Bernstein]] (1987/03/03/0018205) It began with Debussy-like textures, and integrated bits of Caribbean pop music in a style that recalled *the Leonard Bernstein of* ''West Side Story.''+
26. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1409][Caligula]] (1987/03/08/0019639) He's less well inclined toward such baseball personalities as Bill Veeck, who owned the Chicago White Sox during Mr. Kuhn's tenure and whom the commissioner considered something of a fraud (what really went on between the two men was a culture clash, the encounter of a banker and a street peddler); George Steinbrenner, the owner of the New York Yankees, whose antics unnerved Mr. Kuhn just as much as one would expect; August Busch Jr., the owner of the St. Louis Cardinals, whose decisions seemed dictated less by what was good for baseball than by how many cases of Budweiser it might sell; and various other owners - especially Charles O. Finley, *the Caligula of* the Oakland A's -whose codes of style and behavior offended Mr. Kuhn's smothering sense of decorum.

29. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9960][Ronald Reagan]] (1987/03/20/0023137) But after about a half-dozen questions, he seemed to hit his stride, answering at some length and with considerably more composure, even though he never oozed self-confidence like *the Ronald Reagan of* old.+

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q158067][Vivienne Westwood]] (1987/03/24/0024133) AT one of the first and most energetic fashion shows here last week, a laugh-a-minute presentation at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts by *the Vivienne Westwood of* Paris, Jean-Remy Daumas, there were the town's most frivolous fashion trappings: Mohican fur headpieces and doggy-ear hoods, heart-shaped backpacks, pillowcases reading Oui!
31. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q937][Albert Einstein]] (1987/03/27/0024878) If you are a fan of brains, you will no doubt get your fill with this enormous portion, which must come from *the Einstein of* the calf world.
32. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q966018][Frank Loesser]] (1987/03/29/0025359) It originated in a much different form in Paris, and its principal authors, Claude-Michel Schonberg (music) and Alain Boublil (book) are Frenchmen, influenced as much by Bizet as by Kurt Weill, *the Frank Loesser of* ''The Most Happy Fella,'' and, in their use of pop-opera conventions, Mr. Lloyd Webber.+
33. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2857682][Clemente Susini]] (1987/03/29/0025364) In her sculptures of the last eight or 10 years she has, in effect, been both *the Clemente Susini of* our day and -what is more difficult - the inventor of the anatomies that she puts together with such a dexterous hand.
34. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q294912][Richard Pryor]] (1987/04/08/0028366) So Mr. Johnson moves through Harlem, clinical and profane in equal measure, acting as *the Richard Pryor of* the safe sex set.
35. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3925][Grace Kelly]] (1987/04/11/0029124) Local society columnists, much taken with her glamour and her new husband's social prominence, dubbed her ''*the Grace Kelly of* Chicago.''
36. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675][Johnny Appleseed]] (1987/04/12/0029177) I saw myself as *the Johnny Appleseed of* linguistics, persuading hotel owners to put dictionaries in rooms everywhere, enabling weary travelers to look up the meanings and spellings of words used in late-night X-rated movies.

38. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q61059][Ira Gershwin]] (1987/04/16/0030666) Miss Cook's unflagging musicianship honors composers as various as Gershwin, Berlin and Sondheim, and her affection for lyricists, from *the Ira Gershwin of* ''A Foggy Day'' to *the Sheldon Harnick of* ''Dear Friend,'' is nearly as intense.+
39. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2354471][Sheldon Harnick]] (1987/04/16/0030666) Miss Cook's unflagging musicianship honors composers as various as Gershwin, Berlin and Sondheim, and her affection for lyricists, from *the Ira Gershwin of* ''A Foggy Day'' to *the Sheldon Harnick of* ''Dear Friend,'' is nearly as intense.+
40. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q43247][Ingrid Bergman]] (1987/04/19/0031974) He had called her Tiffany, which is fine for a call girl, but not right for *the Ingrid Bergman of* dogs.
41. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4030][Duke Ellington]] (1987/04/22/0032772) He has attributed some of his stylistic inspiration to Bud Powell and McCoy Tyner, but his creation of salsa concerto-style compositions led to his being regarded by some as *the Duke Ellington of* salsa.
42. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1511][Richard Wagner]] (1987/04/30/0035386) It was something to compare in evocative sonority with *the Wagner of* ''Siegfried.''+

46. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q431223][Oliver North]] (1987/05/03/0036472) In the Luce tradition, Mr. Malkin can coin a phrase: the economist Arthur Laffer is ''*the Oliver North of* Reaganomics''; Milton Friedman is ''one of those brilliant one-idea cranks''; and President Reagan's alma mater is the ''providentially named Eureka College.''
47. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q517][Napoleon]] (1987/05/03/0036760) This steady stream of income from the exploitation of a name synonymous with high fashion has earned him a sobriquet, *the Napoleon of* licensors.
48. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q919448][Gary Hart]] (1987/05/06/0037724) The voters only remember *the Gary Hart of* the 1984 primary season - ''new ideas'' that nobody could find.+
49. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254][Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (1987/05/10/0038761) Along with the thousands of failures, a few ritualistic pieces of musical consequence were produced, several by *the Mozart of* the idiom, George Crumb.
50. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q171034][Robert Wilson]] (1987/05/10/0038816) Mr. Freyer, who is also a painter and is sometimes called *the Robert Wilson of* Germany, is best known for his stagings of Philip Glass's ''Satyagraha'' and ''Akhnaten'' in Stuttgart, but he has also directed and designed works as diverse as Mozart's ''Zauberflote'' for Hamburg, Weber's ''Freischutz'' for Stuttgart and Handel's ''Messiah'' for West Berlin.

58. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3097952][Walter Winchell]] (1987/05/22/0042798) A recent historian has described Bald as ''*the Boswell of* the Lost Generation,'' but Root disagrees: ''In my opinion '*the Walter Winchell of* the Lost Generation' would have been more like it.''

63. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q333938][George Jessel]] (1987/05/27/0044042) Compared to the younger smoothies, Mr. Altman, who called himself ''*the George Jessel of* intellectuals,'' addressed the audience from the standpoint of an embattled, aging hipster commenting amusingly on everything from the relationship between food and language to condom advertising.
64. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1270178][George Will]] (1987/05/27/0044071) Some go back to Japan to become celebrities; for example, after six years in Washington, Yoshihisa Komori is now considered *the George Will of* newspaper columnists in Japan.

70. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5593][Pablo Picasso]] (1987/06/19/0050261) 2'' that bespeaks *the Picasso of* ''Guernica.''+
71. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q53822][Henry Miller]] (1987/06/21/0050669) Judging by the author's systematic peppering of his brief plot with gamey episodes of sexual improvisation, and by the hero's awesome arousability (a fleeting memory, an unseemly word, and he is in the manly state), one might think Mr. Faldbakken aspires to become *the Henry Miller of* Norway.
72. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131725][Joan Baez]] (1987/06/21/0050676) One can't always like *the Joan Baez of* this autobiography.+

75. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q562705][Capone]] (1987/06/28/0052644) But it doesn't sufficiently allow for the Napoleonic element in Capone (*the Capone of* cinematic myth, that is, not the real man), and it doesn't permit him to dominate the action as ferociously as he does in most movie versions of the legend.+
76. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40912][Frank Sinatra]] (1987/06/29/0052991) BARRON, JAMES              LEAD: The women had traveled 12,000 miles, all the way from Tokyo, and when they arrived in Manhattan yesterday, they had one man's name on their lips - Hiroshi Itsuki, *the Frank Sinatra of* Japan.+

79. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3369419][Patrick Dupond]] (1987/07/05/0054304) Andris Liepa, the son of Maris Liepa, is an exciting classical dancer with a very contemporary veneer, *the Patrick Dupond of* Moscow but with a poetic edge.
80. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40912][Frank Sinatra]] (1987/07/05/0054412) Mr. Itsuki, who is known as *the Frank Sinatra of* Japan, was trailed by 180 of his most devoted Japanese fans, mostly unmarried middle-aged women, who paid $5,500 each to make the trip.
81. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7317][Giuseppe Verdi]] (1987/07/19/0057826) One problem today is a lack of voices adequate for Wagner and even *the Verdi of* ''Aida.''+
82. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q93284][Marc Chagall]] (1987/07/24/0059580) These paintings suggest that *the Chagall of* the Old Testament was not so much an artist in decline as one overawed by his subject - and if this is understandable, it is also regrettable.+
83. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8768][Henry Ford]] (1987/07/26/0059941) Mr. Safdie was described as *the Henry Ford of* housing.
84. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q221048][Jackie Robinson]] (1987/07/27/0060318) Venice reminds him of ''Othello,'' and prompts an analysis of the tragedy that ends: ''Othello was *the Jackie Robinson of* his day.
85. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q772302][Paul Harvey]] (1987/08/15/0066105) Gabriel Heatter was *the Paul Harvey of* his era, but without Paul Harvey's understated subtlety.
86. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9588][Richard Nixon]] (1987/08/22/0068198) Mr. Coover's latest novel, ''Whatever Happened to Gloomy Gus of the Chicago Bears'' is set in the 1930's, rather than the 50's, but it stands as a book end of sorts to ''The Public Burning,'' and it features a hero who's a twin brother to *the Nixon of* that earlier novel.+
87. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q25089][Woody Allen]] (1987/08/23/0068396) Sort of *the Woody Allen of* Hoboken, Mr. Sayles uses many of his regulars -Maggie Renzi, David Strathairn, Josh Mostel, Nancy Mette - in ''Matewan,'' but he also makes maximum advantage of a deep-voiced newcomer named James Earl Jones, who does his best not to dominate the screen as the natural leader of the black miners.
88. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q739866][Pete Rose]] (1987/08/23/0068626) ''Shays is *the Pete Rose of* the Connecticut Republican Party, hustle, hustle, hustle,'' said Robert S.

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q59215][Robert Redford]] (1988/05/01/0140918) From the English sailor Blackthorne washed up on the beach of 17th-century Japan in ''Shogun'' to the amnesia victim Jason Bourne washed up on the beach in the south of France in 1988 in ''The Bourne Identity,'' Richard Chamberlain has become *the Robert Redford of* the living room, finding a stardom in prime time that has eluded him on the silver screen.
54. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q508574][Billy Martin]] (1988/05/03/0141477) Most baseball people of that era thought that Chandler simply was out to get Durocher, *the Billy Martin of* his time.
55. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q126462][Thomas Paine]] (1988/05/09/0143507) Mr. Buchanan comes across as ''*the Thomas Paine of* the Right,'' and Adm. John M. Poindexter as a ''sphinx-like'' stonewaller, who knew ''something bad was going on'' but didn't want to investigate.

59. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q517][Napoleon]] (1988/05/15/0145401) As a Soviet spy he was *the Napoleon of* deception, the greatest mole of them all, who betrayed British secrets to the K.G.B.
60. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7816545][Tom Lawless]] (1988/05/22/0147564) Hitless No More         Last week was a bad one for hitters who were trying to become *the Tom Lawless of* 1988.
61. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9215][Sigmund Freud]] (1988/05/29/0149577) Peter Gay in ''Freud: A Life for Our Time'' and the book's reviewer, Richard Wollheim (April 24), in their way continue flogging an old horse: *the Freud of* traditional (now ancient, after all) psychoanalytic history.+
62. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q73823][Dirty Harry]] (1988/06/05/0151212) The photograph on the book jacket of ''Criticism and Social Change'' shows a guy in a sports shirt, posed against a graffiti-scarred wall - ''*the Dirty Harry of* contemporary critical theory,'' a reviewer in The Village Voice called him.

64. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1394][Vladimir Lenin]] (1988/06/05/0151446) Though he was condemned by some as a porn king, praised by others as ''*the Lenin of* the sexual revolution,'' the fact remains that Maurice Girodias was courageous enough to publish William Burroughs, Samuel Beckett, Jean Genet, J. P. Donleavy, Nikos Kazantzakis and Nabokov's ''Lolita'' when others were too afraid of censorship to try.
65. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q312656][Lon Chaney]] (1988/06/15/0153997) The notion has evidently got into his head that these high-class markings will harm him with the voters, for he seems intent on becoming *the Lon Chaney of* politics, the Man of a Thousand Faces.
66. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1126349][Connie Mack]] (1988/06/24/0156226) Boxing's Connie Mack         By contrast, Futch, 76, is a mellow type who speaks slowly and softly and carries himself more like an elder statesman, *the Connie Mack of* the fight game.
67. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5547][Antonio Canova]] (1988/06/26/0156751) The Correggio ''Danae,'' the Titian ''Sacred and Profane Love,'' the large group of sculptures by Bernini and *the Canova of* Pauline Borghese would alone put the gallery in a very high class.+
68. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q264117][Brian Wilson]] (1988/06/26/0156840) Anyone who remembers the rock musician of the 1970's and early 80's would be astonished by *the Brian Wilson of* today.+
69. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q720558][Joe Namath]] (1988/06/27/0157164) We were a long way from earlier times when Mr. Nureyev was called ''*the Joe Namath of* dance.''

72. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7243][Leo Tolstoy]] (1988/07/17/0161971) Yet it is with Holbein as it is with *the Tolstoy of* ''War and Peace'' - all of life is somewhere within him, for us to unriddle as best we can.+
73. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q154691][Carlos Fuentes]] (1988/07/17/0161994) This is recognizably *the Carlos Fuentes of* the novels: the birth date is the same as that of ''Fuentes,'' the narrator of ''Distant Relations,'' and the movie reference fits right in with the dedication of ''The Hydra Head,'' ''in strict order of disappearance,'' to Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Claude Rains.+

79. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q38757][Bertolt Brecht]] (1988/07/30/0166253) But in ''Die Walkure,'' the emphasis shifts to *the Brecht of* ''Mother Courage'' - stark studies of tough, painfully real people on a largely bare stage.+

81. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q342778][Pat Boone]] (1988/08/04/0167715) Like the white singers who covered black rhythm-and-blues songs in the 1950's, Mr. Palmer has toned down reggae, soul, rock and funk for the pop audience, offering a well-tailored image - he performed Tuesday at Radio City Music         If not for his experimental streak, Robert Palmer could be *the Pat Boone of* the 1980's.

83. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q188962][James Naismith]] (1988/08/08/0168974) That's because *the James Naismith of* Hoover-ball was the White House physician, Vice Admiral Joel T. Boone, who devised the game as a way to entice Hoover, who was notoriously lackadaisical about his health, into exercising.
84. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q209417][Wallis Simpson]] (1988/08/11/0169750) And Janet Jones, the beautiful bride in what was built up as a royal wedding here July 16, was seen as *the Wallis Simpson of* her time, the wife who coerced her husband into leaving.
85. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q153032][Mona Lisa]] (1988/08/11/0169949) It is here, in this country cabin equipped with fax machine, that the McCoys pursue their design work, all the while gazing at their antique wall mounts of stuffed animals, including one Mr. McCoy calls ''*the Mona Lisa of* deer.''+
86. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q309648][Charles Ives]] (1988/08/12/0170106) Mr. Scelsi, who was widely called *the Charles Ives of* Italy, was known for his choral and symphonic works.
87. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q302][Jesus Christ]] (1988/08/14/0170766) Although Mr. Scorsese's Jesus is not *the Jesus of* scriptures, the film makes us think about who God is - that is to say, what life means.+
88. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30547][Mother Teresa]] (1988/08/14/0170859) That willingness doesn't make him *the Mother Teresa of* his time, but it does make him a responsible businessman, a rare enough species in baseball.
89. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q357444][Lou Gehrig]] (1988/08/17/0171750) The man who has won seven Daytonas and a total of 200 races - although none, Gary Carter, since July 4, 1984, which was 118 races ago - is already *the Lou Gehrig of* racing, about to start his 500th straight race at Brooklyn International Speedway in Michigan on Sunday.
90. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q302][Jesus Christ]] (1988/08/20/0172638) I agree with Mr. Bien; Kazantzakis's story is indeed reverential and consonant with *the Jesus of* the Gospels.+
91. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q517][Napoleon]] (1988/08/21/0172829) They were a completely different breed whose first confrontation with the North was not at Fort Sumter, but 38 years earlier, when a North Carolina colonel, known as ''*the Napoleon of* the turf,'' encouraged any and all Yankees to race their horses against the indomitable Sir Henry - for a stake of $20,000.
92. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21338817][Bruno Cavalcante Bellini]] (1988/08/24/0173692) It was probably inspired by *the Bellini of* Harry's Bar in Venice.+

98. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q182011][Antonio Stradivari]] (1988/09/04/0176939) It was made by W. Heckel, a German company that Mr. Segal described as ''*the Stradivarius of* woodwind manufacturing.''
99. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q864751][The Hatter]] (1988/09/11/0178234) ''They say it can't fly,'' whispers Hughes, *the Mad Hatter of* capitalism, ''but that's not the point.''
100. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q231417][Barbara Walters]] (1988/09/11/0178347) ''The tenor of this club is to denigrate, to humiliate,'' explains Freda Reeser, a member who calls herself ''*the Barbara Walters of* the Hawaiian Jewish community'' because she interviews visiting celebrities for a local magazine.
101. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q748596][Sergei Bubka]] (1988/09/11/0178481) The world record holder in the pole vault jump, *the Sergei Bubka of* the Soviet Union, is the only man to have jumped higher than the ''wall'' of 6 meters.+
102. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q209518][Wayne Gretzky]] (1988/09/11/0178517) No such distinction is made for women, and so Jeannie Longo of France, *the Wayne Gretzky of* women's cycling, will compete in the Games, as a heavy favorite.
103. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5537484][George Bush]] (1988/09/23/0181814) What makes *the George Bush of* 1988 more moderate than Mr. Reagan, particularly in view of the litany of ''social issues,'' from prayer in the schools to guns in the home, that he recited in his acceptance speech?+
104. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9696][John F. Kennedy]] (1988/09/25/0182307) All told, the four years since he quit his corporate directorships on Bay Street to succeed Mr. Trudeau as Liberal leader have been shocking ones for Mr. Turner, whose supporters once hailed him as *the John F. Kennedy of* Canadian politics.
105. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q19837][Steve Jobs]] (1988/09/28/0183345) The Steve Jobs of Taiwan         That Acer has come this far is something of a testament to the drive and unconventional approach of the 43-year-old Mr. Shih, who has become *the Steve Jobs of* Taiwan.
106. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q303][Elvis Presley]] (1988/09/30/0183777) The film's repeated suggestions that *the Elvis of* 1972 ought to return to his 50's roots are certainly sound, but they become tiresome when delivered by the self-righteous Johnny.+
107. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234224][Dian Fossey]] (1988/10/02/0184224) Small wonder, then, that *the Dian Fossey of* ''Gorillas in the Mist'' becomes, as played captivatingly by Sigourney Weaver, a tough, dedicated and extraordinarily single-minded naturalist with nothing terribly unusual to her makeup.+
108. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766][P. T. Barnum]] (1988/10/05/0185168) That was never more evident than at the opening ceremonies of our Olympics, staged by the longtime Hollywood producer David Wolper, *the P. T. Barnum of* patriotism.
109. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36107][Muhammad Ali]] (1988/10/09/0186323) Until recently, the muscular, middleweight Ribbs, whom the racing press once labeled *the Muhammad Ali of* auto racing, might have reacted to such an incident by punching Pruett out in the pits afterward.
110. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q180975][Andrew Lloyd Webber]] (1988/10/10/0186766) But more stems from Mr. Jobs's reputation as *the Andrew Lloyd Webber of* product introductions, a master of stage flair and special effects.
111. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6778432][Marvin Mitchelson]] (1988/10/14/0187685) It was *the Marvin Mitchelson of* old, exhibiting the same high-profile, confrontational approach he'd perfected over the years for Joan Collins, Soraya Khashoggi and Bianca Jagger.+
112. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9711][Honoré de Balzac]] (1988/10/14/0187729) Critics sometimes call Naguib Mahfouz *the Balzac of* Egypt because of the way his works express the pulsating energy of city life and because of their psychologically nuanced characters and broad social concern.

115. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q94081][Bob Hope]] (1988/10/16/0188478) Comedy is Mr. Yoshida's specialty (''I was once called '*the Bob Hope of* Bunraku' ''), and he has adapted a lot from Chaplin and Keaton.
116. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766][P. T. Barnum]] (1988/10/17/0188726) It came from Joshua Evans, the hoopla-minded young proprietor of Lelands auction house in Allentown, Pa., who has emerged as *the P. T. Barnum of* baseball cards.
117. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5603][Andy Warhol]] (1988/10/23/0190647) He is *the Andy Warhol of* opera production, screaming at us to look at sleazy banality with tolerant eyes and recognize it as a new profundity.
118. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q154338][Mathias Grünewald]] (1988/10/24/0191047) That remark is very much to the point, in that Johns's recent paintings inhabit a cross-referential world in which *the Matthias Grunewald of* the Isenheim altarpiece in Colmar is constantly being quoted (though not always in ways that the casual visitor will decipher).+
119. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812][Babe Ruth]] (1988/11/04/0194523) After all, who could ever again even challenge the 978 stitches (his count) earned by Eddie Shore, *the Babe Ruth of* hockey, during his 14-year N.H.L.
120. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q692][William Shakespeare]] (1988/11/06/0195168) LEAD: Most English teachers are familiar with *the Shakespeare of* legend and tradition: the Stratford boy who may have poached deer and rabbit, the ambitious playwright vilified by a rival as an ''upstart Crow,'' the man who willed, curiously, his ''second-best bed'' to his wife.+

122. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q117710][Lorin Maazel]] (1988/11/06/0195310) As we have learned through his appearances at the New York City Opera, Mr. Siciliani is something like *the Lorin Maazel of* Italian opera conductors.
123. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7243][Leo Tolstoy]] (1988/11/13/0197859) Although Mr. Chaudhuri may not be what Saul Bellow would call *the Tolstoy of* the Bengalis, he may remind many readers of Nabokov's Pnin.
124. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6301099][Juan Valdez]] (1988/12/04/0203573) If *the Juan Valdez of* catfish frowns, the whole truckload is rejected and sent for a remedial swim in a fresh pond.

127. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q48231][Idi Amin]] (1988/12/06/0204254) As a result, he is regarded as ''the Stalin of Patchogue, *the Idi Amin of* Long Island,'' which, along with many other aspects of the play, is a considerable overstatement.
128. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q855][Joseph Stalin]] (1988/12/06/0204254) As a result, he is regarded as ''*the Stalin of* Patchogue, the Idi Amin of Long Island,'' which, along with many other aspects of the play, is a considerable overstatement.
129. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q979545][Michael Boskin]] (1988/12/07/0204598) The Michael Boskin of the Bush campaign is a bit different from *the Michael Boskin of* academia.+
130. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9588][Richard Nixon]] (1988/12/12/0205939) The Nixon of the late 60's was indeed different from *the Nixon of* previous campaigns.+

1. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q183266][Samuel Johnson]] (1989/01/08/0212236) ''That gets me back to legitimacy,'' Mr. Coogan explained, but his eyes lighted up when he added, ''I can be *the Samuel Johnson of* comic books: They are really just another form of literature.''
2. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36724][Attila]] (1989/01/11/0213159) The reporters were reporting Bush nicenesses that would have been unthinkable a few weeks ago when this very same George Bush was *the Attila of* the campaign trail.
3. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5537484][George Bush]] (1989/01/11/0213159) It's hard to believe this is *the George Bush of* the autumnal sound bites and photo ops who captured the American voter by the ruthless way he put the boot into anybody who got in his way.+
4. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5598][Rembrandt]] (1989/01/15/0214267) Citing these difficulties, Ingrid L. Thalheimer, president of *the Rembrandt of* Travel Service in Manhattan, said she advised clients to buy a ticket on the spot.+
5. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7315][Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] (1989/01/15/0214304) Its opening theme sounds like *the Tchaikovsky of* ''Eugene Onegin,'' though it was composed considerably before the Russian's opera.+

28. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q152451][Jerry Brown]] (1992/03/30/0517693) The Jerry Brown running for President in 1992 is at odds on crucial issues and campaign themes with the Jerry Brown who ran for President in 1976, the Jerry Brown who tried again in 1980 and even *the Jerry Brown of* just a year ago.+

31. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7199][Marcel Proust]] (1992/04/05/0519231) For some reason he has rejected the gold (there is nothing, for example, from Roger Kahn, *the Proust of* the Brooklyn Dodgers) for the dross -- including selections by Steve Howe about his drug problems and by Steve Garvey about his marital problems, as well as an interminable piece by Tommy Lasorda, which reflects the manager's amiable logorrhea.

43. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8021572][Willie Horton]] (1992/05/11/0527805) If welfare emerges as *the Willie Horton of* 1992, Mr. Cuomo may have wound up on the wrong side of it in a national campaign, even though he sought to curb the soaring costs of social spending programs.
44. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386][Rodney Dangerfield]] (1992/05/13/0528150) So Hall, who had earlier called himself *the Rodney Dangerfield of* the American League because he was omitted from the All-Star ballot, went searching for a little respect.

48. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7243][Leo Tolstoy]] (1992/05/17/0529227) It is easy to sympathize with African resentment of the attitude epitomized by Mr. Trevor-Roper, or for that matter by Saul Bellow asking, "Who is *the Tolstoy of* the Zulus?"

52. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q320633][Francis Scott Key]] (1992/05/29/0532182) It was "Country Joe" McDonald, *the Francis Scott Key of* the Vietnam era, who dominated the movie, at one point leading 500,000 fans in an obscene variant of a familiar high-school cheer.
53. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812][Babe Ruth]] (1992/06/01/0533054) In those years he and the Grays' catcher, the late Josh Gibson, were considered the Lou Gehrig and *the Babe Ruth of* the team that won nine consecutive pennants in what are still called the Negro Leagues.
54. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386][Rodney Dangerfield]] (1992/06/05/0533773) Even today, the infomercial remains *the Rodney Dangerfield of* advertising, shunned and doubted for many reasons: state and Federal investigations of infomercial producers, complaints about product performance and, most crucial, a belief that a lengthy commercial disguised as a conventional program -- like a talk show complete with host, theme song and studio audience -- unfairly masks what is nothing more than a sales spiel.
55. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1349086][Freddie Laker]] (1992/06/05/0533783) He was *the Freddie Laker of* his time: just as Mr. Laker and imitators like People Express opened up air travel to the masses in the late 1970's, Mr. Cook, the creator of the packaged holiday, opened up the world of international leisure travel to the middle class of the last century.

58. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q83396][Eleanor Roosevelt]] (1992/06/14/0535834) For Ms. Cook to take *the Eleanor Roosevelt of* the 1930's and 1940's -- a woman for whom upbringing, etiquette, politeness and other social mores of the time were the guidelines and restrictions of her behavior -- and push 1990's attitudes and so-called liberation upon her is inappropriate, offensive and ill-fitting.+
59. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q692][William Shakespeare]] (1992/06/14/0536108) Besides his theater, Dr. Schoen has his own company of actors, making him *the Shakespeare of* suburbia.

65. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q53393][Jimmy Connors]] (1992/07/02/0540143) Miss Chenchikova, for instance, is *the Jimmy Connors of* ballet: She throws herself full force into her dancing without regard to niceties of form.

69. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1091285][Holly Woodlawn]] (1992/07/10/0541591) At times she looks like an older version of *the Holly Woodlawn of* "Trash."
70. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386][Rodney Dangerfield]] (1992/07/12/0542029) Her trainer, Red Terrill, has been saying for months that she was "*the Rodney Dangerfield of* horses," the one who got no respect.

82. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q313697][Ross Perot]] (1992/08/16/0550630) Mr. Taft lost when *the Ross Perot of* his day, former President Theodore Roosevelt, ran as a third-party candidate and split the Republican vote in 1912.

87. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q47551][Titian]] (1992/08/23/0551899) We could even believe that *the Titian of* St. John the Evangelist on Patmos had always been installed as it is now -- as a ceiling painting set in a simulated Renaissance ceiling -- rather than as a painting that looked out of place on a wall.+
88. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q19837][Steve Jobs]] (1992/08/24/0552306) But now the 36-year-old entrepreneur, often called *the Steve Jobs of* Japan in reference to the Apple Computer co-founder, is in the midst of a fight to save his company from bankruptcy.

121. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q302][Jesus Christ]] (1992/11/06/0568507) His method is scholarly but inexact: by comparing the accounts of Jesus' life set down in the four Gospels, and using evidence from the Dead Sea Scrolls and recent archeological discoveries, Mr. Wilson attempts to create a dispassionate portrait of "the real Jesus, *the Jesus of* History."+

132. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q314712][Barry Bonds]] (1992/11/19/0571427) The 27-year-old Hayes is not *the Barry Bonds of* third basemen, and he might have had a career season when he hit .257 and delivered 18 homers and 66 runs batted in, but he silenced the criticism at a troubling position, and now the nagging questions will start again.

136. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686][Donald Trump]] (1992/12/13/0576115) Father Ritter himself was often mentioned in the same sentence with Mother Teresa, but perhaps Charles M.

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q318165][Luke Perry]] (1993/02/22/0592045) Less elaborate science-fiction than clever adventure caper, "The Tomorrow People" is lively and imaginative entertainment, its international cast featuring Kristian Schmid, an Australian 18-year-old soap star who, Nickelodeon insists, has become *the Luke Perry of* London.

55. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41042][Harold Pinter]] (1994/05/02/0684570) In earlier years, he was *the Harold Pinter of* dance, largely because what he left unsaid in his studies of relationships was as important as what he expressed directly.
56. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4535129][Sol Hurok]] (1994/05/08/0685821) RIFKIN, GLENN              SAM ALBERT may be the quintessential schmoozer and self-promoter, a computer management consultant who calls himself "*the Sol Hurok of* the information systems business."

58. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q452267][Aldrich Ames]] (1994/05/08/0685978) Mr. Brock's role in the Paula Jones affair is curious indeed, so much so that some might take him for a Clinton mole in the conservative camp -- *the Aldrich Ames of* The American Spectator.
59. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4112334][Virginia Clinton Kelley]] (1994/05/08/0686021) Yet *the Virginia Kelley of* "Leading With My Heart" is the quintessence of the self-delighting extrovert, one who genuinely likes people: "I've always enjoyed talking with strangers -- the more different they are, the better I like them"; "I can truthfully say that I have never felt one pang of jealousy toward anybody in my life, and that attitude started when I was a girl."+
60. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q187850][Mathew Brady]] (1994/05/08/0686097) In 75 films, Muky became *the Mathew Brady of* New York's movie panorama, of neo-realism transplanted from postwar Europe.
61. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4911006][Bill Stern]] (1994/05/10/0686448) Frazier is *the Bill Stern of* basketball analysis, an embellisher blindly dishing and swishing his Lesser Word Power in 20 Minutes approach to broadcasting.

67. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9588][Richard Nixon]] (1994/05/24/0689341) Forgotten (or at least played down) was the Other Nixon, *the Nixon of* Watergate and the Cambodia bombings, the Nixon who kept an enemies list and turned red-baiting into a ferocious campaign tactic.+
68. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q190631][Bette Midler]] (1994/05/24/0689343) At one point, Erik's lawyer, Leslie Abramson, *the Bette Midler of* the criminal courtroom, stuck tacks into the photograph of a naked child's torso for shamelessly vivid illustration.
69. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812][Babe Ruth]] (1994/05/25/0689494) He was the natural, *the Babe Ruth of* jazz, and before the word crossover had any meaning, he was one of very few black men who were listened to or watched by whites in an America so much whiter than it is now.
70. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170596][T. E. Lawrence]] (1994/05/29/0690176) If Istanbul is *the T. E.

71. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q318399][Anthony Trollope]] (1994/06/05/0691458) If Raymond Carver, *the Anthony Trollope of* American white trash, had been just a little bit nuttier -- and was still alive and writing -- or if Stephen King could write at all, either one of them would be proud to produce something like "Pluto, Animal Lover."

37. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7314][Igor Stravinsky]] (1996/02/21/0831635) That powerful work set forth the fundamentals of his style: a propulsive rhythmic motion that mixes steady ostinatos and jagged syncopations; sensuously dissonant harmonies, based  on *the Stravinsky of* "Le Sacre du Printemps" and "Les Noces"; high, tremulous vocal lines, alternating with chant and declamation.+
38. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q214548][Andy Williams]] (1996/02/25/0832619) For a while he starred in on-location Christmas shows, making him *the Andy Williams of* Long Island.

40. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q269890][Don Rickles]] (1996/03/03/0833973) "Albano called Margiotta *the Don Rickles of* the Republican Party," D'Amato recalls, then his shoulders start rocking, he whistles and throws his fist in the air exultantly, makes a hockey-game Whoooh noise followed by other stadium shouts.
41. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q311885][Patrick Henry]] (1996/03/05/0834527) He was even listed as a speaker at an April conference at Lake Tahoe that will include Louis Beam, who has served as an ambassador at large for the Aryan  Nations, a white supremacist group, and is described by admirers as "*the Patrick Henry of* our movement."

45. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q888302][Bob Vila]] (1996/03/17/0837471) The 34-year-old Mr. Bunting likes to say he is *the Bob Vila of* computerdom,  but he more closely resembles Susan Powter as a marketing phenonmenon.
46. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q344793][George Burns]] (1996/03/24/0838683) That's because *the George Burns of* my youth was not the huggably wise and wisecracking Jewish leprechaun he would become after "The Sunshine Boys" rejuvenated his career in 1975.+

57. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q93188][Errol Flynn]] (1996/04/21/0845200) This prideful detachment was, of course, a mask: though one friend admiringly called him "*the Errol Flynn of* losers," others realized that Wilder was simply too unsure of his own gifts to make the fullest use of them.
58. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q319072][Rush Limbaugh]] (1996/04/21/0845244) Harry Hurley is "*the Rush Limbaugh of* Atlantic City," said a competing morning talk radio host, Don Williams of WOND-AM, whose dominance of 14,000 listeners has been challenged by Mr. Hurley's growing popularity.

63. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q302][Jesus Christ]] (1996/04/29/0847174) "By pressing the question about *the Jesus of* history, we seek to avoid falling into a sentimental morass of religious subjectivity," he said, or into the "unchecked ideology" that may lurk behind the church's conventional images of Jesus.+
64. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q302][Jesus Christ]] (1996/04/29/0847174) For Christians, he concludes, "the normative Jesus" will never be the pre-Resurrection figure retrieved from behind the texts -- always a hypothetical portrait, even when the retrieval is done better than the current ones -- but *the Jesus of* the Gospel texts.+

69. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q303][Elvis Presley]] (1996/05/06/0848805) Why, Perhaps, It's Called Classical  If television is *the Elvis of* communications technologies and the Internet is Nirvana, radio is more like Bach.
70. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q203990][Marie Taglioni]] (1996/05/06/0848831) Ms. Kent has become *the Marie Taglioni of* the 1990's, but with spunk, a dancer whose poetic lyricism calls to mind descriptions of that great 19th-century ballerina.
71. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5950][James Brown]] (1996/05/08/0849224) He's *the James Brown of* salsa, with a tightly choreographed set and precise pop arrangements for his tunes.

76. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36107][Muhammad Ali]] (1996/05/20/0851983) Like *the Muhammad Ali of* a certain period, who was as preoccupied with injustice as with boxing, Mr. Weah is that rare sports hero whose outspokenness  is both fluid and fearless as he denounces the demons that have tortured his people.+
77. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5125309][Claire Shulman]] (1996/05/21/0852275) "I say Golda Meir was *the Claire Shulman of*  Israel."

79. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1168491][Charlie Brown]] (1996/05/26/0853475) Still, this is New Jersey, *the Charlie Brown of* franchises, where high expectations get tangled like a kite in a tree, where "good grief" is a normal post-game comment.
80. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q597335][John Robinson]] (1996/05/28/0853767) "If I could be remembered as *the John Robinson of* my generation," he said, "that would be high praise."
81. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q310839][Adlai Stevenson I]] (1996/06/02/0854862) It should have been no great surprise that a significant majority of  Israeli Jews would vote their fears in an anxious time, finding Mr. Peres, whose aloofness and political stumbles make him *the Adlai Stevenson of* Israeli politics, less credible on the issue that mattered most to them: security.
82. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q313697][Ross Perot]] (1996/06/09/0856237) "He's *the Ross Perot of* East Hampton," said Bruce Moore, owner of Bruce's Seafood market.

86. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1111386][Robert Moses]] (1996/06/13/0857512) Whatever their origin, it is unlikely the walks came about without the permission, if not the involvement, of William H. Reynolds, *the Robert Moses of*  Long Beach.
87. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421][Michael Jordan]] (1996/06/14/0857634) He said he would bid on free agents "if *the Michael Jordan of* hockey" becomes available.
88. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1398][Virgil]] (1996/06/16/0858002) A historian and journalist by training, he has nonetheless striven for years to bear witness to Montana history in fiction, and to become if not the Homer at least *the Virgil of* generations of Scots who migrated to northwestern Montana before and after it became a state in 1889.
89. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766][P. T. Barnum]] (1996/06/23/0859503) But Kevin J. Kinsella, known as *the P. T. Barnum of* biotech,  has come very close to living the myth.
90. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766][P. T. Barnum]] (1996/06/23/0859504)          INSIDE                     INVESTING IT /Page 4/ Kevin J. Kinsella, known as *the P. T. Barnum of* biotech, sees genomics as the basis of all future drug discovery.+

92. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12306][Millard Fillmore]] (1996/06/26/0860364) Ayh lived only a few more years and seems to have been *the Millard Fillmore of* Pharoahs.
93. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11116][Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] (1996/07/03/0862081) This prospect would have made *the Ruth Bader Ginsburg of* the 1970's proud.+
94. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q312348][Thurgood Marshall]] (1996/07/03/0862081) Her decision, in fact, can be read in several ways, and not all of the interpretations are easy to reconcile with the vision of equal-treatment feminism that she championed as *the Thurgood Marshall of* the women's movement in the 1970's.
95. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q95034][John Barrymore]] (1996/07/05/0862461) GRIMES, WILLIAM              FOR most of this century, the Hudson has been *the John Barrymore of* rivers, noble in profile but a sorry wreck.
96. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812][Babe Ruth]] (1996/07/06/0862685) MARTIN, DOUGLAS              Precious is her name, but at the plate she is the power lady, *the Babe Ruth of* a no-nonsense league.
97. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q327071][Paul Revere]] (1996/07/06/0862725) Ms. Turock, 59, blond, with a voice like honey, has been called "*the Paul Revere of* the Information Age" by the Librarian of Congress, James Billington.
98. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11812][Thomas Jefferson]] (1996/07/09/0863379) And I guess you could say Frank Thomas is *the Thomas Jefferson of* baseball."
99. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q497827][Sam Walton]] (1996/07/14/0864251) Though little known to the general public, Dobson is *the Sam Walton of* the family values movement, a distributor with unparalleled reach.
100. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7245][Mark Twain]] (1996/07/21/0866407) The image I always have is, this is a  river town, and he's like *the Mark Twain of* early music.

102. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386][Rodney Dangerfield]] (1996/07/25/0867025) meetings and bridge parties, folding chairs, *the Rodney Dangerfield of* the home-furnishings world, are stashed in a closet when not in use.
103. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q29456][Michael Johnson]] (1996/07/27/0867603) Godina, competing in his first Games, considered himself *the Michael Johnson of* shot-putters.

105. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7416][Margaret Thatcher]] (1996/07/31/0868645) For Benjamin Netanyahu, the conservative new Prime Minister, cutting those subsidies and slashing that work force rank high in a quest to become *the Margaret Thatcher of* Israel.
106. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421][Michael Jordan]] (1996/08/03/0869199) And, of course, *the Michael Jordan of* Brazilian basketball for the past 20 years, has simply been known as Oscar.
107. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q309648][Charles Ives]] (1996/08/04/0869459) The listener who admires *the Charles Ives of* romantic legend and a few selected pieces but often finds the music rambling and lacking in technical rigor may be prodded to revisit scores and recordings, not only of familiar works like the ''Concord'' Sonata, ''Three Places in New England'' and the Second Symphony but of more problematical works like the mammoth Fourth Symphony, the strangely offhand songs and the forbidding Second String Quartet.+
108. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q29456][Michael Johnson]] (1996/08/04/0869687) It's one thing to win a gold medal, but the way he dominated, he was *the Michael Johnson of* the tennis field today.''
109. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103767][Charlie Parker]] (1996/08/09/0870295) But for all its admiration, ''Basquiat'' winds up no closer to that assessment than to the critic Robert Hughes's more jaundiced one: ''Far from being *the Charlie Parker of* SoHo (as his promoters claimed), he became its Jessica Savitch.''
110. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q43423][Aesop]] (1996/08/09/0870300)          Janet Maslin reviews movie Rendezvous in Paris, written and directed by Eric Rohmer; photo (M)                     Eric Rohmer's ''Rendezvous in Paris'' is an oasis of contemplative intelligence in the summer movie season, presenting three graceful and elegant parables with the moral agility that distinguishes Mr. Rohmer as *the Aesop of* amour.
111. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213550][Billy Graham]] (1996/08/09/0870316) As in the past, the preponderance are Venetian pictures: Tiepolos, Guardis, Canalettos and a Jacopo Bellini that is surgically precise, and movingly so: a small depiction of the sallow, toothless and hollow-eyed St. Bernardino of Siena, who as a popular preacher was something like *the Billy Graham of* Bellini's day.
112. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q13685096][Cinderella]] (1996/08/11/0870605) ''The scullery maid was the lowest position,'' Ms. Maher said, ''like *the Cinderella of* the place.''
113. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q132524][Ayn Rand]] (1996/08/11/0870785) That would probably be bearable if the books weren't getting progressively less readable; but she's *the Ayn Rand of* the spirit realm.
114. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5592][Michelangelo]] (1996/08/13/0871265) The people who ran things four years ago are out, and people who made Republican images in happier days are back -- people like Michael J.

38. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30875][Oscar Wilde]] (1999/02/15/1085377) In addition to Mr. Rees (in a role, it should be noted, he was born for) and Ms. Thurman, there are Michael Emerson (*the Oscar Wilde of* ''Gross Indecency'') and Adina Porter (of Suzan-Lori Parks's ''Venus''), playing, respectively, John, the conciliatory best friend of the humanity-hating Alceste, and Ellen, a ''radical post-feminist journalist.''+
39. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686][Donald Trump]] (1999/02/18/1086058) And the strong sense of history prompts obvious parallels: Karen Cord Taylor, editor and publisher of The Beacon Hill Times, pointed out that Charles Bulfinch, the famed architect and developer whose gems, like the State House, crown Beacon Hill, was something like *the Donald J. Trump of* his day.
40. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5213152][Dan Biederman]] (1999/02/20/1086460) It is this kind of grandiose talk that makes some people kid Mr. Russo about trying to be *the Dan Biederman of* Brooklyn -- a tongue-in-cheek comparison to the Manhattan BID president who got on the wrong side of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for wielding too much power.
41. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766][P. T. Barnum]] (1999/02/23/1087326) He called the highly praised head of the city school system, Paul Vallas, a ''*the P. T. Barnum of* education'' and vowed to dismiss him if elected.

43. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7294][Johannes Brahms]] (1999/02/28/1088353) They are ''really symphonies for piano and orchestra,'' another predictably asserts, which allows another flattering comparison: ''In this case Tchaikovsky resembles *the Johannes Brahms of* the Piano Concerto No.+
44. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q44640][Sting]] (1999/02/28/1088654) The Pyramid  Lower Level Dealers Feel *the Sting of* Laws         Political leaders said harsh sentencing laws were intended to deter use of the most dangerous drugs, with crack at the top of the list.+
45. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7302][George Frideric Handel]] (1999/03/05/1089922) But Mr. Adams, not quite out of his post-Minimalist phase, is not *the Handel of* ''Aureole.''+
46. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5603][Andy Warhol]] (1999/03/14/1092103)          Travel article on new Mucha Museum, in restored 18th-century Kaunicky Palace in Prague, Czech Republic, dedicated to Art Nouveau artist Alfons Mucha; photo (M)                     Alfons Mucha was *the Andy Warhol of* his era, a decorative artist who defined a style -- Art Nouveau -- and became a media star.
47. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1268][Frédéric Chopin]] (1999/03/14/1092125) Nevertheless, the Concerto for Piano and Orchestra by Grieg, who was once called *the Chopin of* the North, opens the festival with Francois-Rene Duchable as soloist and Michael Schondwandt conducting the Collegium Musicum.

49. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2741630][David Wells]] (1999/03/14/1092457) He is still booed in Fenway Park for the outcome of that season, many Red Sox faithful forever maintaining that Zimmer should've rested his regulars more, should've trusted the maverick left-hander Bill Lee -- *the David Wells of* his time -- in a crucial game against the Yankees.
50. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386][Rodney Dangerfield]] (1999/03/18/1093288) The condition has been called *the Rodney Dangerfield of* modern ailments because most patients never take it seriously enough to take it to their doctors' attention and treat themselves with over-the-counter antacids, which may not be enough to prevent dangerous changes in the cells that line the esophagus.
51. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q201608][Dennis Rodman]] (1999/03/21/1094215) Still, he seemed extremely pleased by the welcome he received in New Hampshire, where he was front-page news in the local papers, one of which referred to him as ''*the Dennis Rodman of* potential Republican candidates.''
52. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q551032][John Wooden]] (1999/03/23/1094568) Pushing hard is the ethic of Alamosa, a remote mountain city of 12,000 with a thriving runners colony built around the success of Vigil, considered *the John Wooden of* cross-country running.
53. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q242936][Susan Lucci]] (1999/03/24/1094796)          Public Lives column; author Tom Wolfe discusses his election to American Academy of Arts and Letters; scene at screening of Rory Kennedy's documentary American Hollow at HUD Department described; Paul Robeson Jr, discusses musical talent of his father; photo (M)                     Once a Bridesmaid, Now a Bride in Full         TOM WOLFE can no longer claim to be *the Susan Lucci of* the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

58. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1744][Madonna]] (1999/04/04/1097313) ''It is *the Madonna of* Italian-American literature in that it shows the transition from the Italian immigrant to American citizen like no other book of its genre.''
59. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q174311][Christopher Reeve]] (1999/04/11/1099063) If discipline, hard work and a passionate desire to be whole were enough to restore limb function, *the Christopher Reeves of* this world would be up and around in no time.+
60. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q270707][Dorothy Parker]] (1999/04/11/1099068) Cuetara is a talented artist who clearly qualifies as *the Dorothy Parker of* picture book repartee.
61. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q762][Leonardo da Vinci]] (1999/04/11/1099329) Dr. Reddy's designs for condoms with built-in bulges are an attempt to rethink the way condoms work, prompting Adam Glickman, the founder of Condomania, a specialty retailer and Internet-based mail-order company, to call the taciturn Indian designer ''*the Leonardo da Vinci of* the condom.''
62. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q462481][Mark McGwire]] (1999/04/15/1100327) It's hard to believe that even a Red Sox announcer would refer to the 1998 version of the team's archrivals as ''those pesky New York Yankees,'' which seems a little like calling *the Mark McGwire of* that season a singles hitter.+
63. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q79031][Mike Tyson]] (1999/04/18/1101096) So maybe the rooster is *the Mike Tyson of* chickendom.
64. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q919448][Gary Hart]] (1999/04/20/1101635) Mr. Gore's advisers dismiss Mr. Bradley as *the Gary Hart of* 2000.
65. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q51537][Mike Nichols]] (1999/04/25/1102562) And an overview of his career is a reminder that Mr. Nichols's life and work reflect so indelible a genetic fingerprint that the far bigger surprise would be if *the Mike Nichols of* 23 and *the Mike Nichols of* 67 didn't seem so much the same.+
66. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9200][Paul]] (1999/05/02/1104292) Stashower reports the reactions of crowd and reporters -- the mixture of reverence, incredulity and ridicule that had become associated in his final years with the writer whom many saw as ''*the St. Paul of* spiritualism'' and many more as ''a sad and deluded old man who had squandered his greatness.''
67. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8877][Steven Spielberg]] (1999/05/02/1104452) If Wynton Marsalis is *the Steven Spielberg of* the jazz scene, the alto saxophonist Steve Coleman has a strong claim to being its Stanley Kubrick.
68. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q311885][Patrick Henry]] (1999/05/03/1104902) The Massachusetts House Speaker, Thomas (''No tribute or ransom'') Finneran, who took the heat for driving the Patriots away, now looks like *the Patrick Henry of* football, if only because he had the temerity to call Mr. Kraft ''a whiny millionaire looking for a bribe.''
69. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5383][David Bowie]] (1999/05/07/1105643) Velvet Goldmine         Todd Haynes's film brilliantly reimagines the heyday of British glam-rock and *the David Bowie of* the early 1970's as a brave new world of electrifying theatricality and sexual possibility.+
70. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5679][Lord Byron]] (1999/05/09/1106007) It is this manner that perhaps corresponds most closely to *the Byron of* the personal letters and journals and has some claim to be more expressive of the ''real'' Byron, except that there would be no real Byron to express without the dark Romantic side.+
71. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q561852][Willie Mays]] (1999/05/09/1106292) ''I'd like to talk about a man who many refer to as *the Willie Mays of* the Bronx.''
72. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254][Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (1999/05/09/1106438) Instead, the lithe little guy who cannot fathom why the chroniclers of sport insist on calling him *the masked Mozart of* his genre -- ''How can you compare the Mozart of music to a hockey player who stops pucks?''
73. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386][Rodney Dangerfield]] (1999/05/15/1107670) Then again, this is Queens, *the Rodney Dangerfield of* boroughs, preservationally speaking.
74. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q517][Napoleon]] (1999/05/16/1107816) In the book ''Great Merchants of Early New York'' (The Society for the Architecture of the City, 1987) Joseph Devorkin calls him ''*the Napoleon of* the Department Store industry.''

77. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5598][Rembrandt]] (1999/05/23/1109543) Zind-Humbrecht in Alsace is *the Rembrandt of* the field.
78. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q692][William Shakespeare]] (1999/05/30/1111197) In other scenes, John Gielgud's dying Henry IV carried the banner for *the Shakespeare of* the Old School, opposite the decidedly modern Prince Hal of Keith Baxter, who was unmindful of the melodies of the verse.+
79. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23][George Washington]] (1999/06/04/1112428) If Nelson Mandela is *the George Washington of* this new democracy, the kind of giant among men who turns down offers to be king, then Mr. Mbeki is its John Adams.+
80. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23][George Washington]] (1999/06/04/1112556) If Nelson Mandela is *the George Washington of* this new democracy, the kind of giant among men who turns down offers to be king, then Mr. Mbeki is its John Adams.
81. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2599][Paul McCartney]] (1999/06/11/1114314) Always *the McCartney of* the group, Mr. McLennan gracefully avoids that more famous tunesmith's weakness for banality by turning his sugar sharp without warning, as when a darkening chord progression turned the phrase ''I'm gonna make you happy'' into a threat.
82. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q128799][Ricky Martin]] (1999/06/13/1114740) Clancy is *the Ricky Martin of* the United States military, and he returns the adulation.
83. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23434][Ernest Hemingway]] (1999/06/14/1115269) Like *the Hemingway of* decades ago you, too, may end up feeling differently about Stein and Toklas, though surely without the same frisson of disgust.+
84. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213512][Bill Cosby]] (1999/06/14/1115282) And yet there does not appear in the networks' current roster to be a host of likely successors to Mr. Seinfeld, who left his NBC comedy last season, and Mr. Allen, who wrapped up his hit comedy, ''Home Improvement,'' last month for the ABC unit of Walt Disney -- and no one in the same universe of appeal as icons like Lucille Ball, Jackie Gleason, Mary Tyler Moore and *the Bill Cosby of* the 1980's (though *the Bill Cosby of* today remains perhaps the biggest name still working in prime time).+
85. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q19837][Steve Jobs]] (1999/06/20/1116750) Mark Hernandez doesn't want to be *the Steve Jobs of* the next century.

88. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q189240][Kevin Garnett]] (1999/06/20/1117163) Simply, the chance to be *the Kevin Garnett of* today outweighs the patience and reward of being *the Duncan of* tomorrow.+
89. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q189240][Kevin Garnett]] (1999/06/20/1117307) Simply, the chance to be *the Kevin Garnett of* today outweighs the patience and reward of being *the Duncan of* tomorrow.+
90. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q212762][Burt Bacharach]] (1999/06/25/1118301) The lineup is intended to draw crowds from inside and outside Latin New York, with crossover bands like Inti Illimani of Chile and Noche Flamenco of Spain, as well as Armando Manzanero, the crooning balladeer regarded as *the Burt Bacharach of* Mexico.
91. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30547][Mother Teresa]] (1999/06/27/1118924) Another, Diana Lemieux, described her as ''*the Mother Teresa of* quadrupeds,'' adding, ''She makes feral cats sweet.''
92. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q462925][Randy Moss]] (1999/06/27/1119027) If not, Odom will become *the Randy Moss of* the N.B.A., a guy with a lot of question marks who may pay huge dividends.

94. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5582][Vincent van Gogh]] (1999/07/04/1120682) But I guarantee you, he will become *the Van Gogh of* the 60's.
95. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254][Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (1999/07/04/1120695) A model for this blending of formalism and freedom is the work of George Balanchine, whom Mr. Wilson calls ''*the Mozart of* the 20th century.''
96. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q236540][Rose Kennedy]] (1999/07/04/1120723) But in Glen Cove, a city where the name Suozzi has a Kennedyesque aura, Mrs. Suozzi is the quiet matriarch, *the Rose Kennedy of* a political dynasty with a small-town cachet.

98. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q462481][Mark McGwire]] (1999/07/12/1122958) But even though Pedro Martinez is slight enough to be a tattoo on the biceps of Mark McGwire, he is *the Mark McGwire of* pitchers in 1999.

101. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q35155][Thomas Pynchon]] (1999/07/18/1124065) Moving on, there is the 60's of the war (Tim O'Brien) and the 60's of hippie bliss, sort of (Tom Robbins and *the Thomas Pynchon of* ''Vineland'').+

41. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q229009][Debra Winger]] (2005/03/31/1661131) It features a bright-young-thing jacket photograph in which the author does her damnedest to channel *the Debra Winger of* ''Urban Cowboy.''
42. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q203960][James Earl Jones]] (2005/03/31/1661134) Well over six feet tall, muscular and shaven-headed, with a voice deep enough to qualify him as *the James Earl Jones of* stand-up, he commands a stage.
43. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2258400][Nick Spano]] (2005/03/31/1661241) No one wants to be *the Nick Spano of* 2006, they say.

> 1. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30487][Mikhail Gorbachev]] (2005/04/10/1663656) I don't mean to be dramatic, but I think John LaValle has been *the Gorbachev of* Brookhaven, and just like Gorbachev, his fate was sealed because he was a product of the same corrupt system that he needed to destroy.''
45. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q368744][Charles Atlas]] (2005/04/10/1663822) Mr. Schwarzenegger appeared in Army fatigues and took Mr. Buffett -- who may be *the Charles Atlas of* investors but who has the musculature of a chipmunk -- through a grueling workout to punish him for criticizing inequities in California's property tax system.
46. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q53002][François Truffaut]] (2005/04/10/1663850) Who is *the François Truffaut of* our moment?)
47. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q10993][Tiger Woods]] (2005/04/11/1664152) In his firm face, one could see this was *the Tiger Woods of* three and four years ago, when he streaked to four consecutive major titles while winning 7 of 11 majors.

> 1. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q222134][Ted Kaczynski]] (2005/04/17/1665352) So it takes courage, if not a touch of Brownian madness, to argue, as David S. Reynolds does in his absorbing new biography, ''John Brown, Abolitionist,'' that Brown was not *the Unabomber of* his time, but a reasonable man, well connected to his era's intellectual currents and a salutary force for change.
48. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2896645][Ruth Reichl]] (2005/04/17/1665402) If this was the Zagat's of the air, I would now be *the Ruth Reichl of* the sky.

54. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q209396][Marion Jones]] (2005/04/25/1667645) She ran impressively on the curve -- looking like *the Marion Jones of* 1997 to 2002, when she was ranked No.
55. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q952688][G. Gordon Liddy]] (2005/04/26/1667895) Cablevision is *the G. Gordon Liddy of* corporations, willing to hold a hand to the fire to maintain its principles.
56. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q199369][Naomi Campbell]] (2005/04/27/1668067) The uncombed, untethered Mr. Bolton is fabulously operatic -- *the Naomi Campbell of* the Bush administration, ready at a moment's notice to beat up on underlings.

58. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37030][Thomas Mann]] (2005/05/01/1668875) Bedford has been compared to Henry James, even to Trollope, but she's much more like *the Thomas Mann of* ''Buddenbrooks'': a closet subversive.
59. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1929421][Nicholson Baker]] (2005/05/01/1668882) But ''Freakonomics'' is so sly, finicky and micro-observant that the Indiana Jones comparison feels a little off -- Levitt is more like *the Nicholson Baker of* economists.
> 1. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7302][George Frideric Handel]] (2005/05/01/1668966) 4 of 1693; in the courtly tread of the Chaconne from the Premier Concert of Schieferdecker's 1713 ''Concerts Musicaux''; in a remarkably ripe sarabande by *the Handel of* 1705.

61. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q28493][Ralph Fiennes]] (2005/05/05/1670008) An elegant and hardy singer, Mr. Keenlyside again proved himself a risk-taking actor -- *the Ralph Fiennes of* baritones.

64. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q153032][Mona Lisa]] (2005/05/10/1671338) Cynics suggest that South Africa's extended pondering of the gorilla question was intended to permit the zoo to build its gorilla house and claim permanent ownership of what is, in the zoo world, *the Mona Lisa of* exhibits.+
65. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q942923][Roy Cohn]] (2005/05/15/1672708) Not unlike *the Roy Cohn of* ''Angels in America'' -- who describes himself as ''a heterosexual man'' who has sex ''with guys'' -- Mr. West has said he had ''relations with adult men'' but doesn't ''characterize'' himself as gay.
66. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q162629][Simon Cowell]] (2005/05/16/1672918) Ms. Brown, who had long been *the Simon Cowell of* American media, pointing a crooked Brit finger at the foibles of others, seems less interested in what she used to call ''quality heat'' than pushing her choices for quality political leaders (usually liberal).
67. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q380429][Tony Robbins]] (2005/05/17/1673164) Won't he be remembered as *the Tony Robbins of* professional basketball coaches, the self-help guru who taught Bryant, Shaquille O'Neal and even Michael Jordan to look within themselves for the secrets of the N.B.A.
68. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q295834][Jean-Pierre Léaud]] (2005/05/20/1673804) Mr. Amalric, who won a 2005 César award for Best Actor for the role, has been called ''*the Jean-Pierre Léaud of* the 90's,'' and just as that actor became François Truffaut's nervous muse in a series of films spanning decades, Mr. Amalric seems destined to continue into the 21st century as Mr. Desplechin's filmic alter ego.
69. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812][Babe Ruth]] (2005/05/22/1674615) Turner's track record was dazzling -- he ''won more than 350 races, driving on any surface he could find,'' Edelstein writes, eventually earning the title of ''*the Babe Ruth of* Stock-Car Racing'' -- but his off-track record, especially in light of Nascar's efforts to remake their drivers as gassed-up Mouseketeers, was downright dizzying.
70. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q222071][Courtney Love]] (2005/05/22/1674628) Undaunted, she goes on to become *the Courtney Love of* her time: hanging out with Marcel Duchamp, composing poems that are like ''small explosions'' for The Little Review, parading through the streets in outrageous costumes (a car's blinking tail light for a bustle, a dress covered with bits of newspaper) -- and trying not to succumb to the madness that destroyed her mother.
71. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q353511][Derek Jeter]] (2005/05/26/1675483) The class of the organization comes from Milan's captain, Paolo Maldini, *the Derek Jeter of* soccer -- great player, great leader, handsome, suave.

74. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q472547][David Souter]] (2005/06/03/1677350)          Rep Christopher Cox, Pres Bush's nominee to head Securities and Exchange Commission, has long record in House of promoting agenda of business interests that are cornerstone of Republican Party's political and financial support; he is major recipient of contributions from business groups, accounting profession and Silicon Valley; his pro-business voting record was cited by Bush as primary qualification; biographical profile of Cox; photo; chart (M)                     In Republican and business circles, William H. Donaldson has been viewed as *the David Souter of* the Securities and Exchange Commission, a disappointingly independent choice who sided too frequently with the Democrats.

75. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4961955][Bret Schundler]] (2005/06/05/1677819) After months spent carefully repressing *the Bret Schundler of* 2001 -- the candidate widely perceived as a wild-eyed ideologue who struck fear into the hearts of mainstream Republicans -- the civility and single-minded attention to the details of property tax policy have vanished.
1. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3335][George Orwell]] (2005/06/07/1678321) Her mournful, meditative, appealingly idiosyncratic book is a hybrid, an exercise in literary detection but also a political travelogue that uses Burma to explain Orwell, and Orwell -- especially *the Orwell of* ''Animal Farm'' and ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' -- to explain the miseries of present-day Myanmar (as it is now known).+
76. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q157054][Giorgio Armani]] (2005/06/07/1678349) QUM, Iran              Racks of colored robes, with neat stitches and fitting marks, fill the workshop of this scholarly city's most famous tailor, *the Giorgio Armani of* clerical clothes, Abolfazl Arabpour.
77. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q79031][Mike Tyson]] (2005/06/08/1678697) Those around Tyson hope that when he steps into the ring, he will look more like *the Tyson of* old, rather than an old Tyson.+

80. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36107][Muhammad Ali]] (2005/06/10/1679013) His large head hovers in the air at a sardonic tilt, and I think wryly, ''He's *the Muhammad Ali of* conversation: floats like a butterfly, stings like a bee.''

81. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q169452][Shaquille O'Neal]] (2005/06/12/1679403) He uncharacteristically sank 28 of 32 free throws (a clue the night was like none other for a notoriously poor free-throw shooter, *the Shaquille O'Neal of* his day), and made 36 of 63 field-goal attempts on his typical fadeaway and finger roll.
> 1. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41508][Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] (2005/06/12/1679406) To a man who despairs that his fiancée wants ''one of those several-tiered monstrosities'' for a wedding cake, she shoots back, ''Who are you, *the Mies van der Rohe of* the pastry shop?''
82. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30547][Mother Teresa]] (2005/06/12/1679657) Reg is now dead, while Catherine is *the Mother Teresa of* our time and is long overdue for a Nobel Peace Prize.

84. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3925][Grace Kelly]] (2005/06/16/1680534) Charlotte Jorgensen, a former dance champion who helped the actor John O'Hurley (J. Peterman on ''Seinfeld'') perform a cha-cha, said, ''I'm known as *the Grace Kelly of* the dancing world.''
85. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5182352][Crash Davis]] (2005/06/17/1680925) He is already being called *the Crash Davis of* tennis, after the baseball catcher in the film ''Bull Durham,'' played by Kevin Costner, who sets a record for minor league home runs.

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686][Donald Trump]] (2005/06/22/1682062) By ADAM NAGOURNEY              EVEN with his 24 restaurants in nine cities from London to Los Angeles, even with his four homes, his private jet and his television appearances -- even though he can rightfully claim the title of being *the Donald Trump of* the restaurant world -- Jeffrey Chodorow does not seem a very happy man.
87. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103767][Charlie Parker]] (2005/06/24/1682532)          Ben Ratliff reviews JVC Jazz Festival concert featuring works by late jazz bassist Jaco Pastorius (M)                     In the 1970's and 80's, Jaco Pastorius was *the Charlie Parker of* the electric bass, spooking his colleagues with his brilliance; he was also a daredevil composer and record maker and one of the most imposing, volatile stage performers in jazz.
88. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q434513][Alice Waters]] (2005/06/24/1682620) A pioneer in the slow-zombie movement (think of him as *the Alice Waters of* contemporary horror), Mr. Romero has not joined the recent fad for zippy corpses, as seen in both ''28 Days Later'' and the remake of ''Dawn of the Dead.''

91. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213550][Billy Graham]] (2005/06/26/1683099) The Billy Graham on display at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park this weekend is not *the Billy Graham of* old, who towered over the lectern, carving the air with his right hand while elevating an open Bible in the other.+
92. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1168491][Charlie Brown]] (2005/06/26/1683325) Being *the Charlie Brown of* umpires, I felt that I owed everybody involved written apologies as well as a signed contract to never call another game.

98. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386][Rodney Dangerfield]] (2005/07/05/1685183) He virtually casts Gates as *the Rodney Dangerfield of* war heroes, convinced as he is that George Washington's sterling reputation came, to some degree, at Gates's expense.
99. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1077608][Chris Ofili]] (2005/07/08/1685693) If I were connecting dots, I would link Ms. Genzken, circa 1989, with Mr. Guyton; Jason Rhoades, circa 1993, with Mr. Colen; and *the Chris Ofili of* 15 years ago with the many New York painters now working in a realist, figurative style.

101. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812][Babe Ruth]] (2005/07/14/1687227) In physique, personality and production, Ortiz could be *the Babe Ruth of* the Dominican Republic.
102. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q353754][Paul de Man]] (2005/07/17/1687750) One original-series fan called him ''*the Paul de Man of* current science fiction,'' accusing him of casually deconstructing the story that had been so close to their hearts for so long, only in order to ''make his mark.''
103. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q10520][David Beckham]] (2005/07/26/1690071) But it wasn't until Mr. Cooper, the man the English press has called the Brad Pitt and *the David Beckham of* dance, began to strip to his 18th-century knickers as the irresistibly frozen-hearted, woman-devouring Vicomte de Valmont that the first real frisson shot through the audience.

109. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q150767][Benjamin Britten]] (2005/08/07/1692935) A soliloquy for Hook, delivered by Karloff as purple prose over Wilder's generic underscoring, emerges here as a subtle operatic arioso, oddly reminiscent of *the Benjamin Britten of* ''Billy Budd.''
110. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6939299][Murray Hill]] (2005/08/07/1693059) It's *the Murray Hill of* trees and town houses and big old apartment buildings, churches and clubs and consulates and offices.
111. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q222008][Kathleen Turner]] (2005/08/10/1693653) It's *the Kathleen Turner of* cooking implements: a fiery diva at center stage.

113. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q122634][Robin Hood]] (2005/08/13/1694358) The game's image has also improved because of players like Barry Greenstein, who with good reason is called *the Robin Hood of* Poker: he donates millions of dollars in tournament prize money to children's charities.
114. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41921][Rosa Parks]] (2005/08/17/1695421) I hope that Cindy Sheehan will become *the Rosa Parks of* the Iraq antiwar movement.

116. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3569688][Curtis Sliwa]] (2005/08/23/1696820) Instead, the confrontation was between *the Curtis Sliwa of* today -- a pro-police, law-and-order conservative -- and the younger man with badly damaged credibility he claimed to have left behind.
117. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q864751][The Hatter]] (2005/08/25/1697096) By EVE M. KAHN              Frederick Carder has been called *the Mad Hatter of* glass.

122. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q189081][Howard Hughes]] (2005/09/04/1699273) Kimmelman's trek to visit Michael Heizer's huge, incomplete (and probably unfinishable) ''City'' in the Nevada desert made the author call the sculptor ''*the Howard Hughes of* American art to Smithson's Buddy Holly or Judd's Nietzsche,'' and it seems that Heizer is as much of an enigma as his vast earthwork.
123. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q231417][Barbara Walters]] (2005/09/04/1699450) Triple Town Houses on Sutton Square         PEOPLE magazine once called Yue-Sai Kan *the Barbara Walters of* China.

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q129087][Ethel Merman]] (2005/09/11/1701109) Ms. LuPone -- who, since we're playing that game, might be described as *the Ethel Merman of* the 1980's -- dazzled, and nearly deafened, New York with her lungs of brass in ''Evita'' and ''Anything Goes,'' but has been absent from Broadway musicals for more than a decade.
126. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16390][Humphrey Bogart]] (2005/09/11/1701109) If Ms. Clayburgh was *the Julia Roberts of* the late 1970's, Gabriel Byrne might be described as *the Humphrey Bogart of* the early 1990's.

131. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q460876][Lenny Bruce]] (2005/09/18/1703015) In bestowing its 1993 National Honor Award on the center, the American Institute of Architects' jury called it ''*the Lenny Bruce of* architecture -- bold and brilliant to some and to others irritating and resistant.''
132. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170509][Henry James]] (2005/09/18/1703022) ''I thought of her as *the Henry James of* dance critics,'' he said.
133. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686][Donald Trump]] (2005/09/18/1703222) George Castro, the owner of the Ritz, who is referred to by some people as *the Donald Trump of* Elizabeth, is clearly more honored than surprised.
134. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3294013][Mark Brunell]] (2005/09/21/1703879) ''It looked like *the Mark Brunell of* old,'' Moss told reporters after the game.+

136. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q317128][Jelly Roll Morton]] (2005/09/22/1704035) On Thursday Mr. Barthé, who has been called *the Jelly Roll Morton of* plaster, will put on a borrowed suit and a broad-brim hat sent by a family member familiar with his J.R. Ewing style to accept a now-bittersweet award from the National Endowment for the Arts: a National Heritage Fellowship, which carries a no-strings grant of $20,000.
137. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q382303][Mariano Rivera]] (2005/09/25/1705010) Since it would be second guessing to suggest that Manager Joe Torre should have known that Small was going to rumble out of the bullpen like *the Mariano Rivera of* long relief and toss six and two-thirds scoreless innings, the focus fell upon the miscues by Matsui and Cano.
138. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q35332][Brad Pitt]] (2005/09/25/1705171) Figueras, standing center, is also a Ford model who has been called *the Brad Pitt of* polo players.

140. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2748186][Keith Foulke]] (2005/09/30/1706123) Whereas Torre has had Tom Gordon for the eighth inning and Mariano Rivera for the ninth, Francona has never had *the Keith Foulke of* last season and has had to survive with Mike Timlin as his closer, with auditions for the September setup roles.
141. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q954975][Curt Schilling]] (2005/10/03/1707011) BOSTON, Oct. 2              Curt Schilling is not *the Curt Schilling of* 2004, which is something he has repeatedly acknowledged.

143. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q93341][Miles Davis]] (2005/10/09/1708135) If Doris Kearns Goodwin or David McCullough can lay claim to being *the Miles Davis of* popular history, Winchester is becoming the Kenny G. Where another author might rely on groundbreaking scholarship or at least narrative drive, Winchester, a geologist turned ''globe-trotting correspondent,'' favors a meandering approach laced with bons mots and fusty subject headings -- e.g., ''The Well-Illumined Earth'' and, on the North American tectonic plate, ''The Plate Entire.''
144. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q182589][William Morris]] (2005/10/09/1708203) ''Michele wants to be *the William Morris of* the design world,'' says the developer Sam Nazarian, who courted Caniato for months to lure Starck for a project in Los Angeles.
145. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9559][John Major]] (2005/10/09/1708466) After a while you begin to wonder: Did I really get engaged in politics so I could spend months arguing about the confirmation of Harriet Miers, *the John Major of* American jurisprudence?
146. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4908317][Bill Buckley]] (2005/10/09/1708539) ''And I guess Karl Rove is *the Bill Buckley of* today, in the sense of nurturing the conservative movement.

149. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36322][Jane Austen]] (2005/10/23/1711573) Mary Gaitskill made her reputation as a chilly chronicler of emotional brutality and sexual sadism, earning her the apt sobriquet ''*the Jane Austen of* sickos'' from one Amazon reviewer.
> 1. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q692][William Shakespeare]] (2005/10/23/1711576) Comparisons with Dickens, who was, in a way, *the Shakespeare of* the novel, are particularly suggestive; but Ackroyd, fruitfully, quotes many foreign opinions, old and new, as well.
150. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40531][John Wayne]] (2005/10/23/1712004) But even as Clemens, *the John Wayne of* pitchers, gave a tough-guy answer about ignoring the aches that he had accumulated in 22 seasons, he probably never imagined he would be in the clubhouse getting his hamstring treated after collecting six outs.
1. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q302][Jesus Christ]] (2005/10/27/1712715) ''I tell them it's sincerely written and it's *the Jesus of* the Gospels,'' she said.+

155. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2865273][Arthur Murray]] (2005/11/04/1714895) Chad Johnson, the Bengals' receiver who is *the Arthur Murray of* the N.F.L., performed a rendition of ''Riverdance'' after scoring a touchdown against the Bears on Sept. 25.

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5593][Pablo Picasso]] (2005/11/13/1716977) The artist in question, Michelangelo Merisi, known to most of us as Caravaggio (after his hometown outside Milan), was then among the most famous, innovative and copied painters in Rome -- *the Picasso of* his day, more or less.

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q303][Elvis Presley]] (2005/11/13/1717106) Anointed ''*the Elvis of* cultural theory'' by The Chronicle of Higher Education, and described on his book jackets as ''the giant of Ljubljana,'' the 58-year-old Mr. Zizek is a jocular, motormouthed theorist whose critical musings on postmodernism and popular culture -- rich in deeply spun allusions to the likes of Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch -- are inspired by the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan.
158. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q106275][Juliette Binoche]] (2005/11/19/1718615) It helps that she is *the Juliette Binoche of* sopranos and moves like a dancer.
159. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1317][Osama bin Laden]] (2005/11/20/1718862) ''People talk about him as if he were *the Osama bin Laden of* Latin America,'' Shifter told me, adding that, after a recent lecture Shifter gave at a military institution, two American officers came up to him and said that Morales ''was a terrorist, a murderer, the worst thing ever.''
160. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q122634][Robin Hood]] (2005/11/20/1719129) ''If bin Laden is *the Robin Hood of* jihad,'' the authors write, then Abu Musab al-Zarqawi ''has been its Horatio Alger, and Iraq his field of dreams.''
161. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q202950][John Henry]] (2005/11/28/1720853) Mr. Goto, who is 37, might even be called *the John Henry of* the information age.

165. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q204218][Stuart Sutcliffe]] (2005/12/04/1722083) Paul Simonon was the cool-looking, unmusical bass player -- Gilbert calls him *the Stuart Sutcliffe of* punk rock.
166. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213626][Jesse James]] (2005/12/09/1723424) How else to explain ''Comma Sense,'' which has a blurb from Ms. Truss and claims that the apostrophe is *the Jesse James of* punctuation marks?
167. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2855440][Boston Strangler]] (2005/12/11/1723956) Videocassette recorders did not, as feared, become *the Boston Strangler of* the movie studios.

172. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q327071][Paul Revere]] (2005/12/18/1725933) He relished being called ''*the Paul Revere of* journalism'' for his knack for uncovering major stories first almost as much as he enjoyed being at the top of President Richard M. Nixon's enemies list.
173. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41921][Rosa Parks]] (2005/12/25/1727280) He might have been celebrated in his community, *the Rosa Parks of* Japanese-American life; in fact, he was shunned.
174. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q366563][Dick Clark]] (2005/12/30/1728356) Danny Wright, Julian's wide-eyed sidekick, is agreeably played by Greg Kinnear, wagging his bushy tail and radiating the ageless boyishness that makes him *the Dick Clark of* movie stars.

10. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5284][Bill Gates]] (2006/01/19/1733152) Part of his allure was a success story that made him appear to be *the Bill Gates of* Japan.

13. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8704][Walt Disney]] (2006/01/20/1733390) LOS ANGELES, Jan. 19              Steven P. Jobs could be considered *the Walt Disney of* his era, breathing new life into animated movies with hits like ''The Incredibles'' and ''Toy Story,'' and reinventing Apple Computer as a media darling with its popular iPod.
14. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q315808][Neil Simon]] (2006/01/21/1733467) If he was not exactly *the Neil Simon of* 16th-century Florence, he packed them in and left them laughing.
15. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q913][Socrates]] (2006/01/22/1733751) But it also certifies Mr. Snyder's reputation as *the Socrates of* the late-night airwaves, capable of disarming some carefully constructed personas with a few innocent questions.
16. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1225][Bruce Springsteen]] (2006/01/25/1734499) But in front of this crowd, he wisely hammered out the standards that made him *the Bruce Springsteen of* Long Island.

112. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41921][Rosa Parks]] (2006/07/26/1778560) The long-running controversy began in 1991, when two brothers, Randy and Robert Rose, who some view as *the Rosa Parks of* the fly-fishing set, defied the landowners' restrictions and went fishing on the slough.

116. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q201927][David Hasselhoff]] (2006/08/02/1780256) Rally car racing is *the David Hasselhoff of* motor sports -- big in Europe, a fringe attraction in the United States.
117. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q238948][Typhoid Mary]] (2006/08/06/1781042) An elevator shaft can act as *the Typhoid Mary of* unpleasant aromas, sucking them up and distributing them throughout the building's byways, for instance, or a fish-frying neighbor may prop open a front door.
118. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q834621][Bono]] (2006/08/11/1782058) Whether he will become *the Bono of* emo is not clear, but this weekend at Radio City Music Hall, when Mr. Carrabba's fans join along in shouting his anthems, the sound should be huge.
119. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1316][Saddam Hussein]] (2006/08/13/1782399) Shiites tended to emphasize moral victories rather than political ones, taking as their central narrative Hussein's valiant but failed fight against a dictator -- *the Saddam Hussein of* yore.
120. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6078][Dr. Dre]] (2006/08/13/1782475) The ''85'' riddim is *the work of* Dave Kelly, a brilliant producer who could (but wouldn't) claim to be the Dr. Dre of dancehall.

127. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q149997][Zeppo Marx]] (2006/09/06/1787907) When Elisabeth Hasselbeck, *the Zeppo Marx of* the foursome, said she donned a bathing suit to take a bath with her baby daughter, Ms. O'Donnell went wide-eyed at her prudery and recalled that when she took a more natural bath with her daughter, the child asked, ''When do I get my fur?''
128. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q952539][Curtis Martin]] (2006/09/07/1788211) In 12 years in Australian rules football, Graham, 32, was *the Curtis Martin of* Geelong, commanding the lion's share of attention.
129. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q834621][Bono]] (2006/09/08/1788260) He is also taken up by Mohammad (Charles Daniel Sandoval), a successful Pakistani businessman who recognizes ''*the Bono of* Lahore,'' as he hyperbolically calls Ahmad, and offers to help restart his musical career.
> 1. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170779][Cassandra]] (2006/09/08/1788278) Madeleine K. Albright has also objected to her portrayal, and Mr. Clarke, who is *the Cassandra of* Al Qaeda and one of the film's heroes, has complained about factual distortions.

130. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q190251][Richard Wright]] (2006/09/10/1788839) Doubtless, Flores Forbes does not achieve the kind of depth we would expect from a Ralph Ellison or *the Richard Wright of* ''American Hunger.''
131. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q616886][Ken Burns]] (2006/09/12/1789368) ''They are kind of like *the Ken Burns of* interactive media,'' said Jeff Stafford, the technology director for Communications Arts magazine, a Menlo Park, Calif., publication that oversees an annual interactive design awards competition that Second Story has dominated in recent years in the Info-Design category.
132. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2522402][Harry Winston]] (2006/09/12/1789409) ''It was a present from 50 when I got out of jail a year ago,'' said Mr. Yayo, a member of the G-Unit, referring to a wristwatch roughly the scale and diameter of a hockey puck, covered with pavé diamonds and designed by Jacob Arabo, *the Harry Winston of* the bling-bling set.
133. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8021572][Willie Horton]] (2006/09/13/1789678) Bin Laden has become *the Willie Horton of* the midterms.

135. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q271712][Ida Tarbell]] (2006/09/17/1790422) If there were any doubt, Golden's muckraking investigation -- he's *the Ida Tarbell of* college admissions -- reveals that almost every word uttered by representatives of the top colleges about the care and nuance and science of the much vaunted admissions process is bunk.
136. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q222008][Kathleen Turner]] (2006/09/17/1790493) With her blond hair, deep voice and air of inscrutability, she resembled *the Kathleen Turner of* ''Body Heat,'' but without Ms. Turner's commanding self-assurance and dangerous erotic force field.
> 1. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37388][Francis Bacon]] (2006/09/17/1790540) If you can't decide among the dozen-plus hickory-smoked selections, you can sign up for *the Bacon of* the Month Club and leave the choosing to them.
137. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q193156][Ralph Nader]] (2006/09/22/1791899) With even 2 percent of the vote, Mr. Werner could pull enough from another candidate to make a difference, becoming *the Ralph Nader of* Texas, 2006.
138. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1238811][James Gould Cozzens]] (2006/09/24/1792130) In this, he resembles *the James Gould Cozzens of* ''Guard of Honor,'' that matchless account of America at the work of war, and Just's fiction offers some of the same pleasures, the same shrewd worldliness.
139. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q310184][George Balanchine]] (2006/09/24/1792245) At the front of the room Chitresh Das, the wild-eyed man who styles himself *the George Balanchine of* Kathak, slapped the tabla.
140. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386][Rodney Dangerfield]] (2006/09/24/1792574) But in their locker room, they still view their team as *the Rodney Dangerfield of* the N.F.L., a squad craving respect.
141. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675][Johnny Appleseed]] (2006/09/27/1792983) Overseeing the distribution of the Fon routers is Andrew Rasiej, *the Johnny Appleseed of* Fon's New York program.
142. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8023][Nelson Mandela]] (2006/09/28/1793222) But Mr. Shih, a man sometimes described as *the Nelson Mandela of* Taiwan, is now leading a movement that, as he acknowledged in an interview, is heavily composed of Nationalists, his longtime enemies who once ran the country under martial law.
143. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q57402][Daniel Ortega]] (2006/09/30/1793609) ''The Daniel Ortega of today is not *the Daniel Ortega of* years ago,'' he said.
144. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q460833][Trisha Brown]] (2006/10/01/1793841) ODILE DUBOC is *the Trisha Brown of* French contemporary dance, much admired during the late 1980's and early 90's for an autodidactic style that -- unlike the work of most of her contemporaries -- focused strongly on pure movement.
145. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1225][Bruce Springsteen]] (2006/10/08/1795741) In the eyes of Judy Kastin, a society member and a professional calligrapher who teaches the craft to grade-school children in Long Island, Mr. Jackson is *the Bruce Springsteen of* the quill and vellum set.
146. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6691][Homer]] (2006/10/10/1796120) That is Jean-Henri Fabre, who himself was called *the Homer of* the insect world.
> 1. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q62766][Jay Z]] (2006/10/12/1796555) (Vibe magazine reaffirmed Jay-Z's role as a hip-hop yardstick by putting T. I. on the cover, accompanied by the question, ''Is he *the Jay-Z of* the South?'')
> 1. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5593][Pablo Picasso]] (2006/10/13/1796734) As for Mr. Crumb, he's still *the Picasso of* comics: the unavoidable influence on all younger artists.
> 1. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q303][Elvis Presley]] (2006/10/15/1797185) Mr. Vernon signed autographs for 45 minutes: for one late September night, he was *the Elvis of* the brass set.
147. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q359416][George Hamilton]] (2006/10/20/1798456) (Holland)         BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday) Robert White, the Irish tenor, is *the George Hamilton of* the vocal world: an unbowed, ageless veteran.
148. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q561019][Beau Brummell]] (2006/10/22/1798941) Powers has chosen a brain disorder that doubles as handy metaphor for human miscommunication of all kinds, and then added one more element to the mix, in the form of Gerald Weber -- ''the natty neuroscientist,'' ''*the Beau Brummell of* brain research'' -- who comes to town to lend a hand, or at least gather material for his collection of psychological oddities.
149. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60465][Wieland Wagner]] (2006/10/22/1799005) ''The missing link between Dada and contemporary, the continuation of Artaud, *the Wieland Wagner of* the present time, tra-la-li, tra-la-lo,'' she says.
150. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q712180][Wilford Brimley]] (2006/10/25/1799723) But how do you bump off *the Wilford Brimley of* coaches?
151. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q309618][Giorgio Morandi]] (2006/10/27/1800043) Such comparisons have earned Mr. Marden a kind of flame-keeper status -- something like *the Giorgio Morandi of* radical abstraction, a maker of inordinately beautiful, exquisitely made (and expensive) artworks.
152. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6847436][Mike Jordan]] (2006/10/27/1800192) Their ad is an excerpt from Jay-Z's video of ''Show Me What You Got,'' a song released in advance of ''Kingdom Come'' and which includes the lyric, ''I'm *the Mike Jordan of* recording.''
153. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40531][John Wayne]] (2006/10/29/1800445) John Newcombe Tennis Ranch  Newcombe, who won 26 Grand Slam titles in singles and doubles and who has been called ''*the John Wayne of* tennis,'' runs his camp in the Texas Hill Country, near San Antonio.
154. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3399455][Alan Newton]] (2006/10/29/1800715) In their time together, Ray Newton has been able to assess small changes in his brother's personality; while *the Alan Newton of* old was a little sloppy and disorganized, today he makes an effort to keep his life in order.+
155. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q83059][Saul Bellow]] (2006/10/29/1800877) If there is a precedent for the Frank Bascombe novels to be found in American letters -- and I'm not sure there is, though Frank himself sometimes casts an eye in the direction of Emerson or Henry James -- it is not John Updike but *the Saul Bellow of* ''Augie March'' and ''Herzog,'' big, baggy novels of character whose heroes were far too emphatically themselves to be typical of anything.
156. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q18917590][Joseph Duveen]] (2006/11/03/1801765) ''Hanns Weinberg was *the Joseph Duveen of* antique porcelain,'' said Ms. Beiny, comparing her grandfather to the flamboyant early-20th-century dealer who sold old master paintings to American tycoons.
157. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40523][Julia Roberts]] (2006/11/05/1802313)          Article describes Paz Vega's performance in new film 10 Items Or Less; photo (M)                     Paz Vega         KNOWN as *the Julia Roberts of* Spain, Paz Vega made her American debut two years ago in the big-budget film ''Spanglish.''
158. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421][Michael Jordan]] (2006/11/06/1802795) Frederic Collignon, a 30-year-old who works as a car salesman in Liège, Belgium, but who is considered by his fans to be *the Michael Jordan of* foosball, said, ''Nice mountains, nice view, a little bit too cold, and it is different from Vegas, but I still like the town.''
159. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q104000][Lauren Bacall]] (2006/11/08/1803150) ''This is *the Lauren Bacall of* cheeses,'' he said of the Beenleigh Blue, an English delicacy made from sheep's milk.
160. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4616][Marilyn Monroe]] (2006/11/08/1803158) Curvaceous, cuddlesome and irresistibly charming, the ''Introduction and Allegro'' is something like *the Marilyn Monroe of* the classical-music repertory.
161. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q193146][Anthony Perkins]] (2006/11/10/1803606) Whether stocky or emaciated, Mr. Bale has the look of a man staring into the abyss: think of the young Oliver North crossed with *the Anthony Perkins of* ''Psycho.''
162. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7245][Mark Twain]] (2006/11/10/1803630) ''Cummins is *the Mark Twain of* the engine business,'' said Mike Osega, the publisher of the trade magazine Diesel Progress.
163. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q102462][James Stewart]] (2006/11/11/1803780) Thus spoke this singer-songwriter, who might be described as *the Jimmy Stewart of* folk rock, in his first Manhattan concert in five years.
164. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q130531][Hieronymus Bosch]] (2006/11/12/1804014) A mighty wind, though, is just the beginning of basic gross-out, and Santiago Segura is *the Hieronymus Bosch of* gross.
> 1. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q55800][Oprah Winfrey]] (2006/11/13/1804470) This documentary looks at some of the celebrities whose faces have replaced the ubiquitous images of the fallen leader, including Majed Yassin, an up-and-coming comic, and Shaima Zubeir, who is sometimes called *the Oprah of* Iraq.
165. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1744][Madonna]] (2006/11/24/1806933) Perhaps she knows that many in her audience miss *the Madonna of* so many Madonnas ago, the one who refused refinement and probably thought Oxford was just an insurance company.+
166. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1516578][Urban Meyer]] (2006/11/29/1808166) And in his ascent from obscurity, he has become *the Urban Meyer of* 2006 as the object of pursuit.
167. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q505431][Michael Vick]] (2006/12/02/1808794) Taliaferro was *the Michael Vick of* his day -- and then some.
168. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23][George Washington]] (2006/12/03/1808861) Otherwise, he's *the George Washington of* popular culture: familiar but indistinct, ubiquitous but remote.
169. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1744][Madonna]] (2006/12/03/1808936) The 22-karat gold charms are the signature pieces: a tigress claw, an ohm, *the Madonna of* the Miraculous Medal and the figa, a traditional Brazilian good-luck symbol.+
170. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4883][Ron Howard]] (2006/12/03/1809018) But *the Ron Howard of* ''Night Shift'' preceded the director of ''A Beautiful Mind,'' and before Sean Penn's Oscar turns came Jeff Spicoli.
> 1. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q692][William Shakespeare]] (2006/12/04/1809466) Mr. Lloyd Webber is often referred to as *the Shakespeare of* his time with musicals like ''Jesus Christ Superstar,'' ''Evita'' ''Cats'' and ''The Phantom of the Opera.''
171. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386][Rodney Dangerfield]] (2006/12/04/1809508) For Mr. Stone, the history lesson began five years ago, when, as a new principal, he squeezed $40,000 out of an already tight budget to open a weight-training room for the Indians, which had been *the Rodney Dangerfield of* teams in the city, and hired a storied former high school running back, Altarik White, as coach to lead them.
172. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1338802][Emmitt Smith]] (2006/12/06/1809897) Elam might have had more luck if he had channeled Tommy Davis, *the Emmitt Smith of* running kickers.
173. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q270324][Patti LuPone]] (2006/12/08/1810200) What I mean is that *the Patti LuPone of* 1980 lives again, at Joe's Pub, in the enterprising person of Leslie Kritzer, left, a would-be, should-be Broadway diva paying homage to one of the last of the greats in a strange but wonderful new club act.
174. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q551032][John Wooden]] (2006/12/08/1810379) Years before her mother would co-write a book with Anson Dorrance -- *the John Wooden of* women's college soccer, whose Tar Heel program spawned, among others, Mia Hamm -- Yael was insisting that was where she would go.
175. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q186][Ken Jennings]] (2006/12/10/1810595) But Lawson, presumably viewing Oldham as *the Ken Jennings of* criminalia, falls prey to the common trap of letting only the caged canary sing.
> 1. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q352][Adolf Hitler]] (2006/12/10/1810666) ''I actually consider myself the Stalin of basketball,'' he says, ''*the Hitler of* basketball, the Pol Pot of basketball.''
