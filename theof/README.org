* "the ... of" Vossantos
** preliminary note
With our initial exploratory approach we were able to cover a wide
variety of Vossantos but clearly missed some, as an analysis of some
[[file:../examples/br.org#examples][examples]] shows. Therefore, we thought about simplified patterns which
just match the source, for instance:
#+BEGIN_SRC
  (a|the) (next|new|future|would-be)? ([A-Z][a-z]+ ){1,3} of
#+END_SRC

This pattern would not match the following examples from the NYT
corpus:
- "the Mick Jagger or Michael Jordan of"
- "the Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson of"
- "She could be the Michael Jordan that women's basketball hasn't yet had"
- "He has not been the Michael Jordan in the debates"
- "he was the Babe Ruth, the Michael Jordan, the Wayne Gretzky of racing"
- "if Mel Gibson really were Michelangelo of his generation"
- names which contain lower-case terms (e.g., "van Gogh")
- adjectives that further describe the target, e.g., "the abused
  pint-size Michelangelo of"

This shows the difficulty to find a good balance between recall and
precision. We limited ourselves to the most basic pattern "the
... of", where "..."  represents up to five words which match a
Wikidata entity.

** finding source candidates in the corpus
We search for sentences which contain the pattern
~\\bthe\\s(\\w+\\s+){1,5}?of\\b~:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
  for year in $(seq 1987 2007); do
    # searches for \\bthe\\s(\\w+\\s+){1,5}?of\\b
    ./theof.py nyt_corpus_${year}.tar.gz > theof_${year}.tsv
  done
#+END_SRC

Allowing up to five words (both capitalised and not) adds noise, e.g.,
- "the other is the Maggie Smith of"
- "referred to the writer as the Clifford Irving of baseball"
- "the past are the David Brinkley of"
- "the Pope was the Madonna of"
which causes the entities in those strings to not match. After
extending ~check_wikidata.py~, we can run the extraction.

** most frequent candidates
In the NYT corpus we find 575711 hits for 1987 alone, which comprise
163565 phrases, the ten most frequent ones are the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # echo hits $(cat theof_1987.tsv | wc -l)
  awk -F'\t' '{print $2}' theof_1987.tsv| sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
#+END_SRC

| count | phrase            |
|-------+-------------------|
|  7205 | the end of        |
|  6540 | the University of |
|  4493 | the number of     |
|  3239 | the sale of       |
|  3239 | the rest of       |
|  2451 | the use of        |
|  2233 | the kind of       |
|  2154 | the son of        |
|  1961 | the age of        |
|  1939 | the president of  |

This clearly shows that the approach needs to be improved. Our idea is
to match the source candidates in the phrases against a list of person
names from Wikidata.

** identifying source candidates in Wikidata
This section describes how to extract a list of names from
Wikidata. We focus on items which have the [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P31][instance of]] property [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5][human]].

*** item has "instance of" property "human"

SPARQL query to retrieve all instances of [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5][human]]:
#+BEGIN_SRC sparql
  SELECT ?item ?itemLabel WHERE
  {
    ?item wdt:P31 wd:Q5 .                  # instance of human
    SERVICE wikibase:label {               # ... include the labels
      bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en"
    }
  }
#+END_SRC

Dowloading the data:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
  curl \
      --header "Accept: text/tab-separated-values" \
      --output wikidata_humans.tsv \
      --globoff \
"https://query.wikidata.org/sparql?query=SELECT%20%3Fitem%20%3FitemLabel%20WHERE%0A%20%20{%0A%20%20%20%20%3Fitem%20wdt%3AP31%20wd%3AQ5%20.%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20instance%20of%20human%0A%20%20%20%20SERVICE%20wikibase%3Alabel%20{%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20...%20include%20the%20labels%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20bd%3AserviceParam%20wikibase%3Alanguage%20%22en%22%0A%20%20%20%20}%0A%20%20}"
#+END_SRC

Checking the result:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  wc -l wikidata_humans.tsv
#+END_SRC

: 139649 wikidata_humans.tsv
Clearly some are missing here!

Let us try to get them without a label:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
  curl \
      --header "Accept: text/tab-separated-values" \
      --output wikidata_humans_wo_labels.tsv \
      --globoff \
"https://query.wikidata.org/sparql?query=SELECT%20%3Fitem%20%3FitemLabel%20WHERE%0A%20%20{%0A%20%20%20%20%3Fitem%20wdt%3AP31%20wd%3AQ5%20.%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20instance%20of%20human%0A%20%20}"
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  wc -l wikidata_humans_wo_labels.tsv
#+END_SRC

: 3455229 wikidata_humans_wo_labels.tsv

This looks much better. Is there a way to get a label for all of them?

With the [[https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikidata_Toolkit][Wikidata Toolkit]] and some Java code:
#+BEGIN_SRC java
  public void processItemDocument(final ItemDocument itemDocument) {
      // find an instance of "human"
      if (itemDocument.hasStatementValue("P31", Datamodel.makeWikidataItemIdValue("Q5"))) {
          final ItemIdValue itemId = itemDocument.getItemId();
          final MonolingualTextValue label = itemDocument.getLabels().get("en");
          if (label != null) {
              buf.write(csvEscape(itemId.getId()) + "\t" + csvEscape(label.getText()));
              // add aliases
              final List<MonolingualTextValue> aliases = itemDocument.getAliases().get("en");
              if (aliases != null) {
                  for (final MonolingualTextValue alias : aliases) {
                      buf.write("\t" + csvEscape(alias.getText()));
                  }
              }
              buf.write("\n");
          }
      }
  }
#+END_SRC
it is possible:
: Found 3454611 matching items after scanning 26132045 items.

Of those, 2801931 have a label:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  wc -l wikidata_humans.tsv
#+END_SRC

: 2801931 wikidata_humans.tsv

With the Java code we also extracted aliases for the names (e.g.,
"Mozart" for [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254][Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]) to enable matching against
non-complete names.

We will use that file in the sequel.

*** "fictional character"
Later, we would like to include [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q95074][fictional character]]. We can retrieve
all instances of any subclass of fictional character with this SPARQL
query:
#+BEGIN_SRC sparql
  SELECT ?item ?itemLabel WHERE
  {
    ?item (wdt:P31/wdt:P279*) wd:Q95074. # instance of any subclass of fictional character
    SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en". }
  }
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
  curl \
      --header "Accept: text/tab-separated-values" \
      --output wikidata_fictional_characters.tsv \
      --globoff \
"https://query.wikidata.org/sparql?query=SELECT%20%3Fitem%20%3FitemLabel%20WHERE%20{%0A%20%20%3Fitem%20%28wdt%3AP31%2Fwdt%3AP279*%29%20wd%3AQ95074.%0A%20%20SERVICE%20wikibase%3Alabel%20{%20bd%3AserviceParam%20wikibase%3Alanguage%20%22en%22.%20}%0A}"
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  wc -l wikidata_fictional_characters.tsv
#+END_SRC

: 46227 wikidata_fictional_characters.tsv
Seems reasonable.

** matching the phrases against the Wikidata candidates

We experiment first with the data from 1987 and match all sources in
the "the ... of" phrases against the Wikidata list of humans:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
  ./check_wikidata.py theof_1987.tsv.gz wikidata_humans.tsv > theof_1987_wd.tsv
#+END_SRC

How many (distinct) phrases do remain?
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  wc -l theof_1987_wd.tsv
  awk -F'\t' '{print $3}' theof_1987_wd.tsv | sort -u | wc -l
#+END_SRC

| 2880 | theof_1987_wd.tsv |
|  371 | distinct phrases  |

Which are the most frequent ones?
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  awk -F'\t' '{print $3}' theof_1987_wd.tsv | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
#+END_SRC

| freq | phrase          |
|------+-----------------|
|  764 | the House of    |
|  316 | the wife of     |
|  225 | the Church of   |
|  216 | the Hall of     |
|  122 | the Bill of     |
|   83 | the Freedom of  |
|   77 | the Governor of |
|   59 | the Duke of     |
|   53 | the King of     |
|   45 | the Sultan of   |
|      |                 |
So most of those are covered by rather unusual "names".

** blacklisting names
We put such rather unusual "names" into a [[file:blacklist.tsv][blacklist]]:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  awk -F'\t' '{print $3}' theof_1987_wdfiltered.tsv | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > blacklist.tsv
#+END_SRC
which we manually clean up.

Now we repeat the analysis:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
  export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
  ./check_wikidata.py --blacklist blacklist.tsv theof_1987.tsv wikidata_humans.tsv > theof_1987_wd_bl.tsv
#+END_SRC

How many results did we get?
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  wc -l theof_1987_wd_bl.tsv
  awk -F'\t' '{print $3}' theof_1987_wd_bl.tsv | sort -u | wc -l
#+END_SRC

| 104 | theof_1987_wd_bl.tsv |
|  88 |                      |

Which were the most frequent ones?
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  awk -F'\t' '{print $3}' theof_1987_wd_bl.tsv | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
#+END_SRC

| freq | phrase                 |
|------+------------------------|
|    4 | the Horatio Alger of   |
|    4 | the Frank Sinatra of   |
|    3 | the Woody Allen of     |
|    3 | the Madonna of         |
|    2 | the Tom Seaver of      |
|    2 | the Pete Rose of       |
|    2 | the Joan Baez of       |
|    2 | the Jackie Robinson of |
|    2 | the Groucho Marx of    |
|    2 | the Abraham Lincoln of |

Much better! Let us repeat this process for all other years.

*** TODO criteria
Since the blacklist is quite long
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  wc -l blacklist.tsv
#+END_SRC

: 1290 blacklist.tsv

it is worthwhile to describe how we created it: We have iteratively
examined the source candidates for the years and added names to the
blacklist which were not obviously (famous) people. This mainly
affected names with just one word
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  grep " " blacklist.tsv | wc -l
#+END_SRC

: 62
which often are also English nouns like house, hall, church, bill.

** processing all remaining years
*** matching against Wikidata without blacklist
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
  export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
  for year in $(seq 1987 2007); do
    ./check_wikidata.py theof_${year}.tsv wikidata_humans.tsv > theof_${year}_wd.tsv
  done
#+END_SRC
Now we have restricted the list to phrases which contain a source that
matches a Wikidata item with an "instance of" property of "human".

*** extending the blacklist
**** Step 1
We create an initial blacklist using the terms from the first year:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
  export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
  ./check_wikidata.py theof_1987.tsv wikidata_humans.tsv |\
      awk -F'\t' '{print $4}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > bl.tsv
#+END_SRC

**** Step 2
Now we edit ~bl.tsv~ to remove all entities which are OK ... and then
we cleanup and append to the blacklist which we then commit:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
  sed -e "s/^ *//" -e "s/ /\t/" bl.tsv | awk -F'\t' '{print $2"\t"$1}' >> blacklist.tsv
#  git commit blacklist.tsv -m"+1987"
#+END_SRC

**** Step 3
We extract new candidates for our blacklist using the next year:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
  export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
  # current year (increment)
  YEAR=1988
  LAST_YEAR=$((YEAR-1))

  # use the blacklist we had created previously to create a
  # blacklist-cleaned file
  ./check_wikidata.py -b blacklist.tsv theof_${LAST_YEAR}.tsv wikidata_humans.tsv > theof_${LAST_YEAR}_wd_bl.tsv

  # extend the blacklist by all previous positive terms (such that we do
  # not have to remove them again)
  cp blacklist.tsv blacklist_lybl.tsv
  for iy in $(seq 1987 $LAST_YEAR); do
      awk -F'\t' '{print $3}' theof_${iy}_wd_bl.tsv | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | \
          sed -e "s/^ *//" -e "s/ the /\t/" -e "s/ of$//" | awk -F'\t' '{print $2"\t"$1}' \
                                                                >> blacklist_lybl.tsv
  done

  # now we extract only the new hits
  ./check_wikidata.py -b blacklist_lybl.tsv theof_${YEAR}.tsv wikidata_humans.tsv |\
      awk -F'\t' '{print $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > bl.tsv
#+END_SRC

... and repeat this for the next year (goto Step 2).

** format data for analysis
Put everything into this org file:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
  export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
  rm newR.org
  for year in $(seq 1987 2007); do
    echo "**" $year >> newR.org
    ./tsv2org.py theof_${year}_wda_bl.tsv >> newR.org
    echo >> newR.org
  done
#+END_SRC

Merge with existing ~README.org~:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ./org.py --merge newR.org README.org  > newREADME.org
#+END_SRC

- some sentences contained a Vossanto, but the wrong part was
  identified, e.g., in  1998/12/20/1071267: /''I am not the Peron of
  Venezuela, I am the Chavez of Venezuela,'' he has said./ we have
  identified "the Chavez of Venezuela", though that is not a Vossanto
  (but "the Peron of Venezuela" is one) - those are marked negatived
  with a "(W)"
- some sentences contain several Vossantos where just one was
  identified, e.g., "WHEN the Godzilla of the Internet decides to wed
  *the King Kong of* /content/"

- handling of duplicates, types of duplicates:
  - exact same sentence but different article
  - same phrase/similar sentence in same/different article
- adding markup for modifier

- TODO :: For sentences containing several Vossantos only one source
          is extracted. This means that some sources can not be
          counted properly.

- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q94081][Bob Hope]] (1993/04/23/0604282) is loaded with rap-related cameos that work only if you recognize the players (Fab 5 Freddy, Kid Capri, Naughty by Nature and *the Bob Hope of* rap cinema, Ice-T), and have little intrinsic humor of their own.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q239691][Sandy Dennis]] (1993/09/03/0632371) (Ms. Lewis, who has many similar mannerisms, may be fast becoming *the Sandy Dennis of* her generation.)
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q465417][Dorian Gray]] (1993/12/10/0654992) Also on hand is Aerosmith, *the Dorian Gray of* rock bands, to serve the same purpose Alice Cooper did in the first film.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q352][Adolf Hitler]] (1994/02/04/0666537) The terrors of the code, as overseen by Joseph Breen (who was nicknamed "*the Hitler of* Hollywood" in some quarters), went beyond the letter of the document and brought about a more generalized moral purge.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q13685096][Cinderella]] (1994/09/11/0711230) Kevin Smith, *the Cinderella of* this year's Sundance festival, shot this black-and-white movie in the New Jersey store where he himself worked.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q44176][Hulk Hogan]] (1994/10/25/0720551) Libby's cousin Andrew, an art director who's "so incredibly creative that, as my mother says, no one's holding their breath for grandchildren," opines that "David Mamet is *the Hulk Hogan of* the American theater and that his word processor should be tested for steroids."
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q504455][Andrew Dice Clay]] (1995/09/22/0790066) Mr. Ezsterhas, *the Andrew Dice Clay of* screenwriting, bludgeons the audience with such tirelessly crude thoughts that when a group of chimps get loose in the showgirls' dressing room and all they do is defecate, the film enjoys a rare moment of good taste.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11812][Thomas Jefferson]] (1996/01/24/0825044) Last year's overnight sensation, Edward Burns of "The Brothers McMullen," came out of nowhere and now has Jennifer Aniston acting in his new film and Robert Redford, *the Thomas Jefferson of* Sundance, helping as a creative consultant.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q314805][Elliott Gould]] (1996/03/08/0835139) All coy grins and daffy mugging, Mr. Stiller plays the role as if aspiring to become *the Elliott Gould of* his generation.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103767][Charlie Parker]] (1996/08/09/0870295) But for all its admiration, ''Basquiat'' winds up no closer to that assessment than to the critic Robert Hughes's more jaundiced one: ''Far from being *the Charlie Parker of* SoHo (as his promoters claimed), he became its Jessica Savitch.''
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q43423][Aesop]] (1996/08/09/0870300)          Janet Maslin reviews movie Rendezvous in Paris, written and directed by Eric Rohmer; photo (M)                     Eric Rohmer's ''Rendezvous in Paris'' is an oasis of contemplative intelligence in the summer movie season, presenting three graceful and elegant parables with the moral agility that distinguishes Mr. Rohmer as *the Aesop of* amour.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q450619][Diana Vreeland]] (1997/06/06/0934955) The complex aural and visual style of ''The Pillow Book'' involves rectangular insets that flash back to Sei Shonagon (a kind of Windows 995) and illustrate the imperious little lists that made her sound like *the Diana Vreeland of* 10th-century tastes.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q107190][Peter Pan]] (1997/08/08/0949060) Mr. Gibson, delivering one of the hearty, dynamic star turns that have made him *the Peter Pan of* the blockbuster set, makes Jerry much more boyishly likable than he deserves to be.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8743][Thomas Edison]] (1997/09/19/0958685) Danny DeVito embodies this as a gleeful Sid Hudgens (a character whom Mr. Hanson has called ''*the Thomas Edison of* tabloid journalism''), who is the unscrupulous editor of a publication called Hush-Hush and winds up linked to many of the other characters' nastiest transgressions.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40531][John Wayne]] (1997/09/26/0960422) Mr. Hopkins, whose creative collaboration with Bart goes back to ''Legends of the Fall,'' has called him ''*the John Wayne of* bears.''
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q230935][Annie Oakley]] (1997/12/24/0982708) Running nearly as long as ''Pulp Fiction'' even though its ambitions are more familiar and small, ''Jackie Brown'' has the makings of another, chattier ''Get Shorty'' with an added homage to Pam Grier, *the Annie Oakley of* 1970's blaxploitation.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q122634][Robin Hood]] (1998/04/10/1008616) ''Do not threaten to call the police or have him thrown out,'' went a memorandum issued by another company, when *the Robin Hood of* corporate America went on the road to promote his book abou downsizing.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103949][Buster Keaton]] (1998/09/18/1047276) Fortunately, being *the Buster Keaton of* martial arts, he makes a doleful expression and comedic physical grace take the place of small talk.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5592][Michelangelo]] (1998/09/25/1049076) She goes to a plastic surgeon (Michael Lerner) who's been dubbed ''*the Michelangelo of* Manhattan'' by Newsweek.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q313013][Brian Wilson]] (1998/12/31/1073562) The enrapturing beauty and peculiar naivete of ''The Thin Red Line'' heightened the impression of Terrence Malick as *the Brian Wilson of* the film world.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1067][Dante Alighieri]] (1999/10/22/1147181) Though his latest film explores one more urban inferno and colorfully reaffirms Mr. Scorsese's role as *the Dante of* the Cinema, creating its air of nocturnal torment took some doing.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q937][Albert Einstein]] (2000/12/07/1253134) In this much coarser and more violent, action-heavy story, Mr. Deaver presents the villainous Dr. Aaron Matthews, whom a newspaper once called ''*the Einstein of* therapists'' in the days before Hannibal Lecter became his main career influence.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q504][Émile Zola]] (2001/03/09/1276449) 'Right as Rain'         George P. Pelecanos arrives with the best possible recommendations from other crime writers (e.g., Elmore Leonard likes him), and with jacket copy praising him as ''*the Zola of* Washington, D.C.'' But what he really displays here, in great abundance and to entertaining effect, is a Tarantino touch.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1276][Leonard Cohen]] (2002/08/22/1417676) The wry, sexy melancholy of his observations would be seductive enough in its own right -- he is *the Leonard Cohen of* the spy genre -- even without the sharp political acuity that accompanies it.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6377737][Kato Kaelin]] (2003/04/07/1478881) Then he has settled in -- as ''a permanent house guest, *the Kato Kaelin of* the wine country,'' in the case of Alan Deutschman -- and tried to figure out what it all means.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q44176][Hulk Hogan]] (2003/04/14/1480850) Meanwhile, at 5 feet 10 tall and 115 pounds, Andy is *the Hulk Hogan of* this food-phobic crowd.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q231356][Nora Roberts]] (2003/04/17/1481531) For those who write like clockwork (i.e., Stuart Woods, *the Nora Roberts of* mystery best-sellerdom), a new book every few months is no surprise.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2586583][Henny Youngman]] (2004/03/05/1563840) Together Mr. Yetnikoff and Mr. Ritz devise a kind of sitcom snappiness that turns Mr. Yetnikoff into *the Henny Youngman of* CBS.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q959153][Frank Stallone]] (2004/09/20/1612886) He can read the biblical story of Aaron and imagine ''*the Frank Stallone of* ancient Judaism.''
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q34012][Marlon Brando]] (2005/11/08/1715899) He named his daughter Tuesday, after the actress Tuesday Weld, whom Sam Shepard once called ''*the Marlon Brando of* women.''
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213626][Jesse James]] (2005/12/09/1723424) How else to explain ''Comma Sense,'' which has a blurb from Ms. Truss and claims that the apostrophe is *the Jesse James of* punctuation marks?
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2808][Elton John]] (2006/12/11/1811150) Though Foujita had a fashion sense that made him look like *the Elton John of* Montparnasse (he favored earrings, bangs and show-stopping homemade costumes), and though he is seen here hand in hand with a male Japanese friend during their shared tunic-wearing phase, he is viewed by Ms. Birnbaum strictly as a lady-killer.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23434][Ernest Hemingway]] (2007/04/30/1844006) Mr. Browne also points out that when he introduced Mr. Zevon to an audience as ''*the Ernest Hemingway of* the twelve-string guitar,'' Mr. Zevon said he was more like Charles Bronson.

- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q123867][Marquis de Sade]] (1993/09/26/0636952) When we introduced Word in October 1983, in its first incarnation it was dubbed *the Marquis de Sade of* word processors, which was not altogether unfair.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103846][Groucho Marx]] (1987/09/27/0077726) But the tide eventually shifted, partly because the supreme materialist of physics, Richard Feynman of the California Institute of Technology, a man once described as *the Groucho Marx of* physics, turned the quest for nuclear substructure into a cause celebre.

L. Doctorow of* ''Ragtime.''+
13. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9358][Friedrich Nietzsche]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/08/books/passionate-beholder-of-america-in-trouble.html][1987/02/08/0011389]]) He is something like a parody of Nietzsche, not *the Nietzsche of* ''The Genealogy of Morals'' but of ''Ecce Homo.''+

17. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q452206][Judith Krantz]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/08/theater/stage-view-a-play-that-never-played-by-2-masters-of-satire.html][1987/02/08/0011487]]) The heroine of the play is Diana Breed Latimer, a best-selling author of romantic fiction, *the Judith Krantz of* /her day/.

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q209050][Jan Brueghel the Elder]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/13/arts/art-14-pictographs-from-adoph-gottlieb.html][1987/02/13/0012870]]) Subjects like ''Flora'' and ''The Four Senses'' cause him to come on like *the Velvet Brueghel of* /his set/, putting his trust in multiplicity of subject matter and a high degree of finish.
20. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q762][Leonardo da Vinci]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/18/nyregion/amid-protest-bumpurs-case-nears-its-end.html][1987/02/18/0014363]]) Contending that Dr. Osborne had set himself up as judge, police expert and hand surgeon, Mr. Smirti called him *the Leonardo da Vinci of* /the Bronx/.

22. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q295107][Mr. T]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/01/us/washngton-talk-come-the-weekend-it-s-talk-show-city.html][1987/03/01/0017607]]) President Reagan is said to be a great fan of the ''McLaughlin Group'' and has called Mr. McLaughlin ''*the Mr. T of* /TV journalism/.''

26. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1409][Caligula]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/08/books/baseball-s-ruling-servant.html][1987/03/08/0019639]]) He's less well inclined toward such baseball personalities as Bill Veeck, who owned the Chicago White Sox during Mr. Kuhn's tenure and whom the commissioner considered something of a fraud (what really went on between the two men was a culture clash, the encounter of a banker and a street peddler); George Steinbrenner, the owner of the New York Yankees, whose antics unnerved Mr. Kuhn just as much as one would expect; August Busch Jr., the owner of the St. Louis Cardinals, whose decisions seemed dictated less by what was good for baseball than by how many cases of Budweiser it might sell; and various other owners - especially Charles O. Finley, *the Caligula of* /the Oakland A's/ -whose codes of style and behavior offended Mr. Kuhn's smothering sense of decorum.
27. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q327071][Paul Revere]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/13/nyregion/our-towns-trash-from-li-sits-uneasily-in-upstate-dump.html][1987/03/13/0021181]]) Mr. Blake, a retired businessman, became *the Paul Revere of* /Summit trash/.

33. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2857682][Clemente Susini]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/29/arts/art-view-sculpture-as-a-high-wire-performance.html][1987/03/29/0025364]]) In her sculptures of the last eight or 10 years she has, in effect, been both *the Clemente Susini of* /our day/ and -what is more difficult - the inventor of the anatomies that she puts together with such a dexterous hand.
34. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q294912][Richard Pryor]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/08/nyregion/new-aids-battlefield-addicts-world.html][1987/04/08/0028366]]) So Mr. Johnson moves through Harlem, clinical and profane in equal measure, acting as *the Richard Pryor of* /the safe sex set/.

39. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2354471][Sheldon Harnick]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/16/arts/stage-barbara-cook-in-song-and-memories.html][1987/04/16/0030666]]) Miss Cook's unflagging musicianship honors composers as various as Gershwin, Berlin and Sondheim, and her affection for lyricists, from the Ira Gershwin of ''A Foggy Day'' to *the Sheldon Harnick of* ''Dear Friend,'' is nearly as intense.+

65. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8768][Henry Ford]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/05/us/powered-by-sun-young-racers-look-to-future.html][1988/06/05/0151262]]) Twenty-one-year-old Mr. Worden, the leader of the M.I.T. team, is described by his admirers as *the Henry Ford of* /solar cars/.

P. Donleavy, Nikos Kazantzakis and Nabokov's ''Lolita'' when others were too afraid of censorship to try.
67.

77. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254][Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/17/travel/a-gainsborough-landscape.html][1988/07/17/0162061]]) Gainsborough is *the Mozart of* /portraiture/.

84. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37327][Samuel Beckett]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/31/books/bleak-visions-hand-clapping-lessons.html][1988/07/31/0166391]]) He is a master of erasures and negations, a visionary of discomfort and reproof, *the Samuel Beckett of* /postwar American poetry/.

Eisenhower]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/01/opinion/the-year-of-living-smugly.html][1998/01/01/0984416]]) He reacted angrily to charges that he had become a caretaker chief executive, coasting toward retirement on a surging economy, *the Dwight Eisenhower of* /the baby boomers/.
2. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16225915][Young]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/01/garden/wharton-s-passion-written-in-the-snow.html][1998/01/01/0984438]]) Decidedly Un-Communist Goals For *the Young of* Central Europe+
3. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q230935][Annie Oakley]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/02/movies/movie-guide.html][1998/01/02/0984556]]) Ms. Grier, *the Annie Oakley of* /1970's blaxploitation films/, makes a game comeback even if she struggles with the story's ensemble loafing.
4. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5443][Greta Garbo]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/03/sports/helen-wills-moody-dominant-champion-who-won-8-wimbledon-titles-dies-at-92.html][1998/01/03/0984733]]) Reclusive by nature and dubbed *the Garbo of* /the tennis tour/ by Alice Marble, one of the many opponents who felt ignored by her, Wills nonetheless lived a most public and, at times, storybook existence.
5. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4653][Sherlock Holmes]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/05/theater/this-week.html][1998/01/05/0985423]]) This is *the Holmes of* the London of the 1880's, investigating the murder of a servant girl on the Waterloo Bridge.+
6. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q517][Napoleon]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/05/theater/this-week.html][1998/01/05/0985423]]) Sherlock Holmes turns 144 tomorrow, but he and *the Napoleon of* /crime/ are still at it.
7. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4291304][Ruth Messinger]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/06/nyregion/ferraro-enters-battle-to-take-d-amato-seat.html][1998/01/06/0985708]]) ''She's *the Ruth Messinger of* /1998/,'' Mr. Mahoney said, referring to the Democrat who lost to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani this year.
8. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1744][Madonna]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/07/books/arts-abroad-living-with-a-shortage-of-everything-but-desire.html][1998/01/07/0985825]]) Alejandro Armengol, a critic for El Nuevo Herald, a Miami newspaper, dismissed Ms. Valdes last year as ''*the Madonna of* /Cuban literature/, with an equal capacity to transform self-assurance and the grotesque into spectacle, to show vulgarity and eroticism stripped of any mystery.''
9. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6882][James Joyce]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/09/books/books-of-the-times-a-sad-life-through-thick-glasses-wittily.html][1998/01/09/0986280]]) There are shades of *the James Joyce of* ''Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'' in this unnamed person, whose own tragedies are told almost in passing, in his subordinate clauses.+
10. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q517][Napoleon]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/11/nyregion/dining-out-experienced-hand-in-a-familiar-setting.html][1998/01/11/0986967]]) We loved them all: the moist cranberry brioche pudding, the warm apple tart crowned with cinnamon ice cream, the homemade sorbets, *the Napoleon of* exotic fruits and the creme brulee sampler.+
11. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7411423][Samuel French]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/11/nyregion/theater-review-passing-the-clues-along-with-the-salt.html][1998/01/11/0987037]]) Referring to the New York rights and royalties agency, he added, ''I'm *the Samuel French of* /interactive theater/.''
12. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1889422][Felix Unger]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/12/nyregion/metropolitan-diary-032824.html][1998/01/12/0987178]]) I must have appeared shocked by his fastidiousness because he looked at me and said, ''I know, I'm *the Felix Unger of* /the Sanitation Department/.''
13. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q44640][Sting]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/13/nyregion/inside-053120.html][1998/01/13/0987374]]) Reducing *the Sting of* Time  New actuarial studies and findings that life spans are easier to manipulate than biologists had imagined are giving those who study aging cause to not talk of it as inevitable and entirely immutable.+
14. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q230935][Annie Oakley]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/16/movies/movie-guide.html][1998/01/16/0988137]]) Ms. Grier, *the Annie Oakley of* /1970's blaxploitation films/, makes a game comeback even if she struggles with the story's ensemble loafing.+ (D)
15. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9960][Ronald Reagan]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/20/world/netanyahu-in-washington-courts-conservatives.html][1998/01/20/0989011]]) Mr. Falwell referred to Mr. Netanyahu as ''*the Ronald Reagan of* /Israel/.''
16. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9960][Ronald Reagan]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/20/world/netanyahu-in-us-woos-conservatives.html][1998/01/20/0989013]]) ''Benjamin Netanyahu is *the Ronald Reagan of* Israel,'' Mr. Falwell said to loud applause from several hundred people who gathered to greet Mr. Netanyahu at the request of Voices United for Israel, a coalition of conservative Jewish and Christian organizations.+
17. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5195372][Curt Flood]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/22/nyregion/public-lives-sure-footed-in-the-slippery-world-of-rock.html][1998/01/22/0989491]]) But Jack Newfield, who has written several New York Post columns lamenting the industry's neglect of Mr. Price, called him *the Curt Flood of* /rock-and-roll/, the rebel who showed a generation of musicians how to stand up for themselves.
18. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q230935][Annie Oakley]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/23/movies/movie-guide.html][1998/01/23/0989634]]) Ms. Grier, *the Annie Oakley of* /1970's blaxploitation films/, makes a game comeback even if she struggles with the story's ensemble loafing.+ (D)
19. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6483431][Lance Ito]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/24/opinion/journal-all-monica-all-the-time.html][1998/01/24/0989958]]) Given Kenneth Starr's record as *the Lance Ito of* /prosecutors/ -- he's already spent three years-plus on Whitewater -- our new national soap opera could easily supply us with entertainment for as long as O. J. did.
20. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q13685096][Cinderella]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/25/nyregion/life-in-the-other-four.html][1998/01/25/0990204]]) And the Bronx, no longer even entitled to a capital T in The Bronx, with its salutary high coastal elevation, is still regarded as a borough of cinders except when the Yankees triumph and it becomes for the moment *the Cinderella of* /boroughs/.
21. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q134183][Magic Johnson]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/28/sports/sports-of-the-times-hamilton-and-lopez-didn-t-quit.html][1998/01/28/0991077]]) Lopez came to St. John's as the great Dominican hope from Rice High, maybe *the Magic Johnson of* /Manhattan/, and Hamilton came from Sewanhaka High in Nassau County, the 6-foot-11-inch sidekick for a potential romp to the Final Four.
22. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q216288][Garth Brooks]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/29/books/making-books-now-grisham-by-e-mail.html][1998/01/29/0991260]]) But Grisham is *the Garth Brooks of* /popular literature/.
23. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q230935][Annie Oakley]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/30/movies/movie-guide.html][1998/01/30/0991472]]) Ms. Grier, *the Annie Oakley of* /1970's blaxploitation films/, makes a game comeback even if she struggles with the story's ensemble loafing.+ (D)
24. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9588][Richard Nixon]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/01/opinion/don-t-ask-don-t-tell.html][1998/02/01/0991893]]) A virtue of Greg Mitchell's book is that it puts *the Nixon of* 1950 in realistic perspective.+
25. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q517][Napoleon]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/01/nyregion/dining-out-a-warm-oasis-with-well-turned-food.html][1998/02/01/0991925]]) But skip the small, nothing-special oysters in Creole butter and *the Napoleon of* /portobello mushrooms/, grilled vegetables and goat cheese made too sour by an overdose of balsamic vinegar.
26. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7963465][Wally Pipp]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/02/arts/bob-russell-entertainer-is-dead-at-90.html][1998/02/02/0992419]]) But then, by some reckonings, Mr. Russell was *the Wally Pipp of* /show business/.
27. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3335][George Orwell]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/04/arts/on-the-trail-of-missing-antecedents-and-meaning.html][1998/02/04/0992795]]) She has been called *the Orwell of* /copy editors/, the Kasparov of syntax.
28. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q28614][Garry Kasparov]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/04/arts/on-the-trail-of-missing-antecedents-and-meaning.html][1998/02/04/0992795]]) She has been called the Orwell of copy editors, *the Kasparov of* /syntax/.
29. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q720][Genghis Khan]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/05/business/legends-of-ore-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-venerable-name-in-south-african-mining.html][1998/02/05/0993081]]) His name has a powerful resonance: Mzilikazi, the most fearsome general of the Zulu King Shaka, *the Genghis Khan of* /Africa/, who rebelled and fled, cutting a swath of destruction across southern Africa in the 1820's and 1830's.
30. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170344][Anselm Kiefer]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/06/arts/art-in-review-447790.html][1998/02/06/0993369]])  William Kentridge, one of the standouts at Documenta X in Kassel, Germany, last summer, may be *the Anselm Kiefer of* /South Africa/.
31. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234606][Martha Stewart]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/08/nyregion/about-long-island-all-natural-all-the-time-except-for.html][1998/02/08/0993756]]) Perhaps *the Martha Stewart of* /B-6 and goldenseal root/.
32. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q151593][Olivier Messiaen]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/12/arts/critic-s-choice-classical-cd-s-birdsong-at-dawn-and-a-heroine-on-the-edge.html][1998/02/12/0994762]]) Of the two solo pianists heard here, Pierre-Laurent Aimard in ''Reveil'' gives a performance of great virtuosity and detailed musical character, whereas Joela Jones in ''Sept Haikai'' is more vehement and more subjective, sometimes making the birds sound like Scriabin -- or like *the Messiaen of* younger days.+
33. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1744][Madonna]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/15/nyregion/council-for-arts-makes-awards.html][1998/02/15/0995492]]) Ms. Haviland, a sculptor, will use her award for ''Misericordia Cabinet,'' a large work based on pre-Renaissance paintings of *the Madonna of* Mercy, who shelters small votive figures under her expansive cloak.+
34. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30755][Auguste Rodin]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/15/nyregion/art-review-putting-together-pieces-of-a-career-cut-short.html][1998/02/15/0995540]]) Mr. Colavita certainly surmounted that bias (although he could also indulge in crafts) to the degree that his teaching colleague, the painter Mel Leipzig, could with some aptness refer to him in an interview in The Trenton Times last month as ''*the Rodin of* /New Jersey/.''
35. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q44616][Wyatt Earp]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/15/sports/sports-of-the-times-the-ballad-of-men-searching-for-gold.html][1998/02/15/0995712]]) In second place, the irrepressible Canadian and skating to his own exotic tune, Elvis Stojko, perhaps *the Wyatt Earp of* /the crowd/.
36. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41921][Rosa Parks]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/16/nyregion/man-who-set-off-firecrackers-is-called-hero.html][1998/02/16/0995903]]) Some people have gone so far as to declare him *the Rosa Parks of* /Chinatown/.
37. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q347528][Liberace]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/17/style/john-bartlett-on-the-fringe-no-more.html][1998/02/17/0996011]]) That distinction goes back at least 20 years to Don Robbie, who besides playing a pivotal role in Pierre Cardin's business in the United States, was something of *the Liberace of* /the fashion industry/, keeping a pink bed at the center of his showroom.
38. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q213812][Babe Ruth]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/17/business/market-place-no-sales-but-watch-the-stock-soar.html][1998/02/17/0996027]]) Mr. Peizer developed his high profile in his 20's, when he became a salesman at the Beverly Hills office of Drexel Burnham Lambert, where he sat next to the man he describes as *the Babe Ruth of* /the bond business/.
39. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q39792][Jack Nicholson]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/22/arts/classical-music-making-maestros-for-the-world.html][1998/02/22/0997094]]) Yet even some of his countrymen refer to him, with amused reverence, as *the Jack Nicholson of* /Scandinavia/.
40. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q82222][Little Richard]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/22/nyregion/neighborhood-report-flatiron-buzz-a-big-night-for-rap-but-not-all-stars-shone.html][1998/02/22/0997273]]) ''I've been dissed, we've been dissed,'' said Mr. Herc, who calls himself ''*the Little Richard of* /the hip-hop business/.''
41. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q553321][Vince Lombardi]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/22/sports/xviii-winter-games-ice-hockey-enterprising-russian-team-hasn-t-forgotten-world.html][1998/02/22/0997356]]) He is Viktor Tikhonov, *the Vince Lombardi of* /hockey in the former Soviet Union/.
42. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q457840][Will Rogers]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/25/business/shake-up-health-giant-new-chief-true-believer-hopes-salvage-reputation.html][1998/02/25/0997888]]) Oxford has ''brought in *the Will Rogers of* /family physicians/,'' said Mr. Cain, who said Dr. Payson had never met a doctor he did not like.
43. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1744][Madonna]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/01/style/style-over-substance-a-decade-later-star-status-for-the-80-s.html][1998/03/01/0998972]]) But a cover story hyping it in the March issue of Vanity Fair -- with its exclusive pictures of her daughter, Lourdes, and its revelation that Madonna's father's favorite female singer is not his daughter but Celine Dion -- leaves readers cold compared with *the Madonna of* old.+
44. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q209518][Wayne Gretzky]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/02/sports/hockey-hockey-s-improvising-gold-glove-hasek-has-redefined-way-play-goalie-but.html][1998/03/02/0999298]]) ''I call him *the Wayne Gretzky of* /his position/,'' Muckler said.
45. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q302][Jesus Christ]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/04/us/taiwanese-group-prepares-to-meet-god-in-texas.html][1998/03/04/0999734]]) The group spent a few weeks last summer in British Columbia searching for a man whom Mr. Chen describes as the ''Jesus of the West'' (the boy Chi-Jen Lo is *the Jesus of* /the East/).
46. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q230935][Annie Oakley]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/06/movies/a-guide-to-films-with-nominations.html][1998/03/06/0999998]]) Ms. Grier, *the Annie Oakley of* /1970's blaxploitation films/, makes a game comeback even if she struggles with the story's ensemble loafing.+ (D)
47. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q888675][Bobby Short]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/08/magazine/the-road-crew.html][1998/03/08/1000310]]) ''; Danny Showers, *the Bobby Short of* /the West/, lounge singer at the Westin Tabor Center in Denver ''You learn to read the business week like a good book.
48. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40662][John the Baptist]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/08/magazine/the-new-business-class.html][1998/03/08/1000313]]) Even Marshall McLuhan, *the John the Baptist of* /the wired universe/, remarked, ''You get moving very quickly and you end up in the wrong place.''
49. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1254][Kofi Annan]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/08/style/the-night-for-the-american-century-a-party-just-as-grandiose.html][1998/03/08/1000595]]) It was a task that must have required the diplomacy of *the Kofi Annan of* /party planners/.

51. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9545][Tony Blair]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/13/opinion/the-comparable-tony-blair.html][1998/03/13/1001742]]) On March 1, Francesco Cossiga, a former Italian president, conferred the title of ''*the Tony Blair of* /the right/'' on Gianfranco Fini, who is now reveling in his role as a low-fat Fascist.
52. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4020209][Willie Morris]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/15/books/a-death-in-mississippi.html][1998/03/15/1002327]]) What delectable dish would a Turgenev or a Marshall Frady have served up with these characters -- or *the Willie Morris of* ''North Toward Home?''+
53. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7317][Giuseppe Verdi]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/15/nyregion/music-in-recital-handbells-and-brass.html][1998/03/15/1002473]]) For Connecticut Grand Opera and Orchestra, *the Verdi of* choice is the Requiem, with a solo vocal quartet of Frances Ginsberg, Victoria Livengood, Carlo Scibelli and Alexander Anisimov, and the company's own chorus swelled to 300 voices by the Choral Arts Society of Ossining and the New Choral Society of Central Westchester.+
54. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q76988][Rothschild]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/20/business/a-wildcatter-on-the-tame-side-replacing-roughnecks-with-computers.html][1998/03/20/1003456]]) To manage his operations, Khedoury Zilkha, by then known as *the Rothschild of* /the Middle East/, deployed his four sons around the world, with Selim drawing Paris, then London.

58. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q13685096][Cinderella]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/27/movies/at-the-movies.html][1998/03/27/1005150]]) ''Han bronzes are *the Cinderella of* /the Chinese art world/,'' said Michael Goedhuis, a London dealer who is exhibiting 11 bronzes from one tomb in southwest China at the Asian Art Fair.

79. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q207405][Zsa Zsa Gabor]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/17/garden/17chickens.html][2007/05/17/1847901]]) We were thrilled to discover she was a rather fancy type known as a Frizzle -- *the Zsa Zsa Gabor of* /chickens/.
80. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5593][Pablo Picasso]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/18/arts/design/18nang.html][2007/05/18/1848087]]) The 18th-century painter and calligrapher Ike Taiga was something like *the Pablo Picasso of* /Japan/.
81. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q19673][Al Gore]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/magazine/20wwln-gore-t.html][2007/05/20/1848550]]) But *the Al Gore of* September 2005 was not the Saint Albert of today.+
82. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234606][Martha Stewart]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/arts/television/20tvcol.html][2007/05/20/1848574]]) THE SECRET LIFE OF MRS. BEETON (13, 49) Anna Madeley plays Isabella Beeton, whose ''Book of Household Management'' sold millions of copies and made her *the Martha Stewart of* /1860s Britain/, in this ''Masterpiece Theater'' biopic.
83. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8704][Walt Disney]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/movies/20kehr.html][2007/05/20/1848597]]) Even the death of Bambi's mother pales in comparison to the bloody war between a mining camp and the resident spirits of a mountain forest at the center of Hayao Miyazaki's ''Princess Mononoke,'' a 1997 film by the animator most often called *the Walt Disney of* /Japan/.
84. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766][P. T. Barnum]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/21/movies/21cann.html][2007/05/21/1849039]]) He's still *the P. T. Barnum of* /activist cinema/, but he no longer runs the entire circus directly from the spotlight.

86. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q193368][Ted Turner]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/arts/design/27fiel.html][2007/05/27/1850120]]) You could think of him as *the Ted Turner of* /great moments in sports history/, except that Mr. Kreindler doesn't rely on computerized colorization but instead conducts painstaking research to ensure that the hues he chooses are accurate.
87. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q153032][Mona Lisa]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06E5DB1630F934A15756C0A9619C8B63][2007/05/27/1850170]]) On loan from the collection of the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam, it is *the Mona Lisa of* fakes.+

90. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766][P. T. Barnum]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/01/travel/escapes/01Lecture.html][2007/06/01/1851208]]) Mr. Johnson, who had been a crew member on Jack London's ill-fated 1907 voyage on the Snark, was *the P. T. Barnum of* /the lecture circuit/ and one of the earliest adventure-film makers.
91. +[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q298016][Fred Thompson]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/01/us/politics/01watch.html][2007/06/01/1851248]]) But *the Fred Thompson of* ''Law & Order'' fame is better suited as chief of staff.+
92. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675][Johnny Appleseed]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/books/review/Teresi-t.html][2007/06/03/1851623]]) In 1993, he attended a lecture by Terence McKenna, the ''geeky American'' who became *the Johnny Appleseed of* /psilocybin/.
93. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60809][Ansel Adams]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/10/travel/10cultured-gt.html][2007/06/10/1853443]]) A 52-year-old photographer from Little Rock, Ark., Mr. McDermott may be *the Ansel Adams of* /Angkor/.

95. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1328702][Michael Brown]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/11/opinion/11mon2.html][2007/06/11/1853778]]) Mr. Gonzales is *the Michael Brown of* /the Justice Department/, smilingly presiding over incompetence, chaos and malfeasance, while President Bush insists that he is doing a heck of a job.
96. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q550381][Dick Wolf]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/12/arts/television/12lear.html][2007/06/12/1853926]]) Denis Leary would seem an unlikely candidate to become *the Dick Wolf of* /dark/, morally muddied TV series about firefighters, cops and lawyers -- and perhaps no more so than on a morning last week on an Upper East Side playground.
97. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2685][Arnold Schwarzenegger]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/dining/reviews/13wine.html][2007/06/13/1854107]]) Aldo called it *the Arnold Schwarzenegger of* /zweigelts/, and not coincidentally it was the most expensive zweigelt in the tasting, at $28.
98. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5443][Greta Garbo]] ([[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/opinion/13dowd.html][2007/06/13/1854256]]) We'll have to wait to see if David Chase, *the Garbo of* /goombahs/ now pursued by a feral beast of disappointed ''Sopranos'' fans, is feeling as paranoid and thin-skinned as the two Tonys, and as deeply surprised by the consequences of his actions.
99. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q162629][Simon Cowell]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/16/arts/television/16tvcol.html][2007/06/16/1854714]]) (She is billed as *the Simon Cowell of* /matchmaking/.)

101. [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q327071][Paul Revere]] ([[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/19/science/earth/19conv.html][2007/06/19/1855557]]) Time magazine once nicknamed him ''*the Paul Revere of* /the environmental movement/.''
