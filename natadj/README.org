* national adjective + person
** a list of national adjectives
- copy content of table from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_adjectival_and_demonymic_forms_for_countries_and_nations][Wikipedia list]] into LibreOffice Calc
- delete all but the first two columns
- [[https://ask.libreoffice.org/en/question/71281/export-hyperlinks-url-in-csv-file/][extract hyperlink from first column]]
- delete footnotes
- fix China/Taiwan, Congo
- export as TSV (three columns: country name, adjective, URL)
- result: [[file:countries.tsv][countries.tsv]]

** testing detection with NLTK
For each adjective we feed the string "the ADJECTIVE Barack Obama"
through NLTK and check the result:

Notes: 
- "LOCATION PERSON" always with countries whose names starts with
  "South" or "North"
- The patterns change if we take another person than Barack Obama
  (e.g., Franz Beckenbauer)
