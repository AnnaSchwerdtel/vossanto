''We change baseball history,'' Topp said. Among the committee's determinations is that Babe Ruth's father, George Herman Ehrhardt, gave his own name to the son (the family name was changed to Ruth at some unestablished point) and that long before Henry Louis Gehrig was so known, he had been given a very Teutonic name by his German-immigrant parents. Also uncovered: the fact that Pete Burg, an infielder with the 1910 Boston Braves, stood only 5 feet 1 inch instead of a listed 5-10, to say nothing of a 19th-century guy named Ryan who changed his identity to Sheehan on Sundays because his parents didn't want him playing Sunday ball.

In 1961, at the age of 25, Tony Kubek was the starting shortstop for the New York Yankees, arguably the best baseball team of all time. With Ralph Houk, its rookie manager, the team won 109 games, hitting an incredible 240 round-trippers, then soundly defeated the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series. But 1961 is most memorable for the assault by Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris on Babe Ruth's record 60 home runs. The country went wild. A stripper billed herself Mickey Maris. Fans checked daily box scores, noting the progress of the M and M boys more closely than they charted the Dow Jones. Sales of M & M candies soared. The pressure on both players was enormous, but it was Roger Maris who somehow earned the derision of the fans. On the last day of the season he did pop the record-breaking homer, but his hair fell out, he developed a rash and never again scaled the heights of that year. Mr. Kubek, who provides commentary for television's ''Game of the Week,'' and Terry Pluto, the co-editor of ''A Baseball Winter,'' help us remember that frenzied time. Peppered with anecdotes (like the time Whitey Ford and Mickey Mantle put pine tar in Mr. Ford's deodorant - which Yogi Berra had the annoying habit of borrowing), this is an insider's view: lively, entertaining and, perhaps best of all, nostalgic.

York, a right-handed hitting catcher and third baseman who later was a fixture at first base, belted 18 home runs in August 1937, and no slugger has ever had a better month. Willie Mays of the San Francisco Giants came close with 17 in August 1965, and that stands as the National League record. York hit only 17 other homers in 1937 for a total of 35. Mays had 52 in 1965. When Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs for the Yankees in the 1927 season, the last 17 came in September, and that's the monthly record York eclipsed, as well as the 60-year-old standard that still stands for left-handed batters.

One who did it was George Halas, who played 12 games in right field for the Yankees in 1919, then suffered a hip injury that ended his baseball career. He continued to play pro football and became famous as the owner and coach of the Chicago Bears. Had he stayed healthy, his baseball career would not have been secure because the next year the Yankees got a new right fielder, Babe Ruth.

And whenever Yankee fans yearn for the good old days, they should remember that with Mattingly at first base, these are the good new days - no matter what the principal owner thinks.
nyt_corpus_1987.har/07/21/0058558.xml	        Despite the persistent ache, Mattingly's eighth-inning double Sunday night gave him at least one extra-base hit in 10 consecutive games, surpassing the league record that had been set by Babe Ruth in 1921.
nyt_corpus_1987.har/07/21/0058712.xml	        During his eight-game streak, the Yankee first baseman hit a total of 10 home runs, including two grand slams. He drove in 21 runs with 17 hits in 37 times at bat for a .459 average. He also had two doubles. He scored 11 runs. He had two walks and only two strikeouts. With 49 total bases in his 37 times at bat, he had a 1.324 slugging average. And the Yankees won five of the eight games. To compare the stature of the Mattingly-Long streaks with other batting records of their type, three of baseball's most astute accountants were consulted - Seymour Siwoff and Steve Hirdt of the Elias Sports Bureau, which keeps the stats for both the National League and the American League, and Alan Roth, who has been charting baseball numbers for more than four decades. Here is the composite ranking: l. Joe DiMaggio's 56-game streak, which also was the core of his being on base in 84 consecutive games. 2. The 44-game hitting streaks of Pete Rose and Willie Keeler that share the National League record. 3. The Mattingly-Long streaks. ''If Babe Ruth had hit a homer in eight consecutive games,'' Siwoff said. ''it would have been part of his litany. Now that Mattingly has done it, what Long accomplished will be appreciated for what it was and is -one of the great records.'' 4. Frank Howard's total of 10 home runs over six consecutive games for the Washington Senators in 1968. ''He hit as many home runs in six games,'' Hirdt said, ''as Mattingly did in eight.'' 5. Twelve consecutive hits, set over four games by Mike (Pinky) Higgins of the Boston Red Sox in 1938 and equaled over three games by Walt Dropo of the Red Sox in 1952. ''As great a record as this is,'' Roth said, ''a home-run record is harder to get.'' 6. Tony Lazzeri's total of 15 runs batted in, set over two consecutive games for the 1936 Yankees. 7. Twenty-five total bases over two consecutive games, set by Ty Cobb of the Detroit Tigers in 1925 and equaled by Joe Adcock of the Milwaukee Braves in 1954. Adcock had 18 in one game with four homers and a double. 8. Oscar Grimes's 17 consecutive games in which he batted in at least one run for the 1922 Chicago Cubs. 9. Seven consecutive extra-base hits, set by Elmer Smith of the Cleveland Indians in 1922 with three doubles and four home runs, and equaled by Earl Sheely of the Chicago White Sox in 1926 with six doubles and one home run. 10. Paul Waner's 14 consecutive games with at least one extra-base hit (12 doubles, 4 triples and 4 homers). Going into last night's game in Minnesota, Mattingly had 10 straight games with at least one extra-base hit. 11. Eight consecutive pinch-hits, set by Dave Philley of the 1958 Philadelphia Phillies and equaled by Rusty Staub of the 1983 Mets. 12. Joe Sewell's 115 consecutive games without a strikeout for the 1929 Indians over 437 times at bat. He struck out only 4 times in 152 games that season, as he also did in 155 games in 1925. ''Bo Jackson,'' Hirdt said, ''strikes out four times in a game now.'' 13. Ted Williams's streak of getting on base 16 consecutive times for the 1957 Red Sox - two singles, four homers, nine walks, one hit by pitch. 14. Rudy York's 18 home runs in one month (August) for the 1937 Detroit Tigers. Babe Ruth hit 17 in September for the 1927 Yankees; Willie Mays hit 17 in August for the 1965 San Francisco Giants. 15. Al (Red) Schoendienst's eight doubles over three consecutive games for the 1948 St. Louis Cardinals. Stan Musial of the 1954 Cardinals and Nate Colbert of the 1972 San Diego Padres each hit five home runs in a doubleheader, but their record was not ranked because it occurred on one day, not over a span of at least two days.

So, for 1987 let's award Andre Dawson a Babe Ruth trophy and save the m.v.p. honor for Ozzie Smith, or (as some have suggested) Will Clark.

Many young sports fans know the joy of settling onto a grandfatherly lap and listening to colorful tales from someone who professes to have seen Babe Ruth swing a bat or experienced the patriotic euphoria created by Jesse Owens in 1936. In this collection of childhood memories and homespun stories, Peter Schwed - the author of several books, a former editor at Simon & Schuster and a self-proclaimed ''sports freak'' who grew up in the 1920's - tries to be everyone's grandfather. A native of Long Island and a passionate club-level tennis player, he writes mainly of such personal passions as his family's devotion to Princeton sports, his father's penchant for horses, his brother's sense of humor and his own quest for a tennis haven. Mr. Schwed's sports knowledge, his admiration for athletic achievements and compassion for perhaps the most maligned of athletes, the defeated, are evident. But his meandering accounts of the intricacies of such sports as badminton and carom billiards, combined with his sometimes overly romantic style, dampen the impact of his reflections. The author also missed several opportunities to break new ground. Any tidbit concerning perhaps the most profound enigma in tennis history, Bill Tilden, would have been welcomed. But Mr. Schwed, who edited a book written by Mr. Tilden while the former player was serving a prison term for homosexually molesting a minor, dismisses the incident in one paragraph. Sports books of this nature can often provide useful reminders of some glorious past feats. Unfortunately, ''Overtime'' deteriorates rather quickly into a family album.

Gehrig could have probably had more runs batted in if the batter in front of him most of the time on those powerful Yankee teams, Babe Ruth, had not driven home so many himself. Ruth missed by 292 r.b.i. of averaging one a game (2,211 in 2,503 games). But he was a pitcher in 163 of those games, probably more interested in keeping the bases clear than in clearing the bases.

Most pitchers are right-handed, and if left-handed hitters have an advantage, that's what it is. A right-handed curveball breaks in toward a left-handed batter, making it easier to handle than a pitch that breaks away. Mattingly has proven equally dangerous against left-handers as right-handers, though. Pitchers sometimes link Mattingly with Boston's great hitter, Wade Boggs, another lefty. But they acknowledge that Mattingly's power, his ability to create big innings with a three-run home run, places him a notch above Boggs, and thus in a league by himself.

The Philadelphia Athletics of 1931, stocked by Manager Connie Mack with such Hall-of-Famers-to-be as Mickey Cochrane, Lefty Grove, Al Simmons and Jimmie Foxx, won 17 games in a row on the way to winning their third consecutive pennant. That team, which finished 13 1/2 games ahead of the Babe Ruth-Lou Gehrig Yankees, only lost 45 times in 152 decisions.  QUESTION: An answer last week pointed out that two members of the same team have scored 40 or more points in a regulation game four times during regular-season play in the National Basketball Association. How about during the playoffs? That's only been done twice in 42 years, only once until a month ago. On March 29, 1962, Elgin Baylor scored 45 points and Jerry West 41 for the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 4 of their Western Division final against the Pistons at Detroit. Nevertheless, the Pistons were 118-117 winners, although the Lakers won the series in six games, chiefly because Baylor averaged 38.6 points and West 31.5.

So is the incomprehensible. So is the unintelligible. Interviewing Babe Ruth in 1928 for the Chicago Daily News, I put it to him, 'People come and ask what's your system for hitting home runs - that so?' 'Yes,' said the Babe, 'and all I can tell 'em is I pick a good one and sock it. I get back to the dugout and they ask me what it was I hit and I tell 'em I don't know except it looked good.' ''

Creamer, whose biographies of Babe Ruth and Casey Stengel are sports classics, even prove that something new can be said about Roger Maris, Mickey Mantle, Whitey Ford and all the other stars on the second-greatest team in Yankee history. (Most students of the game reserve No. 1 status for the 1927 Yankees of Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth.) To set the scene, Mr. Creamer, who takes turns with Mr. Houk in telling the story of ''Season of Glory,'' paints a vivid portrait of 1961, a year of social change and unrest, in which the daily headlines focused on the space age, the Bay of Pigs and the civil rights movement. It was also a year of change for baseball. The addition of new teams forced the extension of the season from 154 games to 162, giving rise to the then commissioner of baseball Ford Frick's stern assertion, even before Maris hit 61 home runs, that any records broken that year would be accompanied in the record books by an asterisk. And at Yankee Stadium, after leading the team to 10 pennants and seven World Series championships in his 12 years as manager, the aging Casey Stengel was being forced out. Taking the crafty veteran's place was a young, untried and relatively unknown Yankee coach and former minor league manager, Ralph Houk.

In researching biographies of sports figures in the 1920's and 1930's, including Babe Ruth, I spent weeks and weeks reading through newspapers and magazines of that period. While Lenglen and Wills were superb athletes who frequently attracted a great deal of well-deserved attention, particularly in Britain and France, the publicity they generated and the headlines they gathered did not approach the massive, detailed, continuing press attention given to Dempsey and Ruth, who were clearly the most prominent and the most lastingly popular sports figures of the era - in short, the biggest headliners.

At a news conference in Tokyo, Oh said that he would resign as manager of the Yomiuri Giants next week after another disappointing season by the team that once dominated Japanese baseball. The front office, which used the expiration of Oh's five-year contract as a graceful moment to ease him out, appointed Motoji Fujita as manager. Oh, 48 years old, took full responsibility for the team's third-place finish in the Central League. ''I had expected this to come,'' said Oh. ''Over the past five years I have not been able to meet expectations, and I accept that. In this world of professional sports, you have to win. That's the bottom line.'' Oh's entire career was spent with the Giants, starting in 1959. During his 21-year playing career, the team won 13 pennants and 12 Japan Series titles, and Oh hit 868 home runs, exceeding the 755 by Henry Aaron and the 714 by Babe Ruth. But managing in a six-team league, his Giants were third three times, second once and won the pennant last year but lost the series to the Seibu Lions.

nyt_corpus_1988.har/11/27/0202021.xml	        GRACIE: A Love Story. By George Burns. (Putnam, $16.95.) Reading George Burns's loving tribute to his late wife, the comedienne Gracie Allen, is the next best thing to watching reruns of the couple's long-running 1950's television series. Burns and Allen were married, both on stage and off, for 40 years. They began as a vaudeville act in the 1920's, graduated to radio in the 1930's, then gave television one of its first and most memorable situation comedies from 1952 to 1958. The key to the act's success was not Mr. Burns, who always played the straight man, nor the material, which could sometimes be corny even by vaudeville standards. What kept the show going was Allen, who used her exquisite comic timing to transform a stock ''dizzy dame'' character into what Mr. Burns calls ''the national symbol of misunderstanding.'' Gracie's role as the dumb wife is dated, but her ''illogical logic'' can still draw laughs: she once determined to meet Babe Ruth and his twin brother, for instance, after reading that the Babe's double had won a game. She also once threatened to run for governor of the State of Coma, saying she had been there for years, and sometime later announced her candidacy for President on the Surprise Party. After she retired in 1958, Allen's heart ailments gradually worsened. She died in 1964 at the age of 58. Mr. Burns tells her story as if he were doing a stand-up comedy routine; he even lets the reader know when he is puffing on his cigar as a signal to laugh. This entertaining monologue is the kind of memorial that would please any comic for one simple reason: it leaves the audience with a smile.

Four years earlier, Haines was a reserve outfielder for the Yankees when they won the World Series from the Giants in six games. Haines, a rookie who got into 28 regular-season games and batted .160, appeared twice in that 1923 Series. He replaced Babe Ruth in right field in the eighth inning of Game 3, with Ruth switching to first base, and Haines grounded out in his only time at bat during a 1-0 Yankee loss to Art Nehf. In Game 6, Haines went in as a pinch-runner for Fred Hofmann and scored on a single by Bob Meusel during a five-run Yankee eighth, then played center field the last two innings and was there for the final out of the Series. That was the final major league appearance for Haines, who died in 1979 and remains the only athlete to play for both World Series and N.F.L. champions.

Nettles and Dempsey came up with Minnesota, Evans with Atlanta, Fisk with Boston and Buckner with Los Angeles, where he batted once in 1969 as a pinch-hitter and thus qualified as a 1960's major leaguer. Simmons began his career in 1968, five years after Tommy John, who at 45 is still looking to catch on with someone.

In batting practice you can see their two young sluggers, Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire, dispose of dozens of baseballs over the Phoenix Stadium fences. The first time I talked to Canseco was after a 1986 workout at the stadium. I mentioned that in the minor leagues the year before he had hit 40 homers. ''Forty-one,'' he said without a smile. Then a 21-year-old rookie, Canseco took his slugging seriously enough to become that spring's ''phenom,'' baseball slang for phenomenal prospect. T HE EXCITEMENT OF SPRING training, however, does not just come from observing the season's new stars. I last saw an aging Henry Aaron there in 1976. The man who broke Babe Ruth's record would complete his career with a record 755 home runs.

What goes on across the white lines is infinitely more important than what goes on behind them. A close friend who consistently strikes out with the bases loaded isn't as much use to a ballplayer as a despised teammate who consistently strokes game-winning hits. The respect a player feels for a teammate's personal life has nothing to do with the respect he feels for a teammate's baseball talent. Babe Ruth, Pete Rose and Wade Boggs are three of the greatest hitters ever in the game, and yet not many teammates might envy their personal lives. Yet to a man, every player in the game would want one of those three at the plate if a World Series championship was on the line.

nyt_corpus_1989.har/04/23/0243190.xml	        BASEBALL ANECDOTES. By Daniel Okrent and Steve Wulf. (Oxford University, $18.95.) Even the most erudite baseball fan may not know that Babe Ruth was the game's first underwear model, that the brainy catcher Moe Berg counted Sanskrit among the languages he knew, that Rogers Hornsby avoided movies to protect his batting eye or that the former Yankee manager Billy Martin had cosmetic surgery on his nose when he was 22 years old. Of such beguiling minutiae is ''Baseball Anecdotes'' made. Daniel Okrent, co-author of ''The Ultimate Baseball Book,'' and Steve Wulf, a senior editor at Sports Illustrated, essentially have written a history of the game in stories - comic, tragic, controversial - starting with baseball's disputed origins and ending with the 1986 World Series. The monochromatic prose rarely does justice to these lusty tales. Some are attributed, some are not and some have the ring of apocrypha about them. The younger fan is enthralled to discover that Hank Greenberg's mother promised to make him 61 baseball-shaped portions of gefilte fish back in 1938 if he broke Babe Ruth's record of 60 home runs in a season. Readers curious about players' afterlives will learn that the Yankee outfielder Mickey Rivers became a professional bingo player, that Honus Wagner toured Pittsburgh saloons in search of recognition and free beers and that a drink-dissipated Grover Cleveland Alexander did a stint as a circus freak. (The authors do not say what kind.) Idolators of macho men will find their demigod in the Cleveland Indians' outfielder Joe Charbonneau, who tried to fix his own broken nose with a pair of pliers, pulled one of his own teeth and stitched up a stab wound with a fishing line. Some stories, however, touch on a provocative point and fail to follow through: the authors never explain why Mr. Martin got that nose job or why the legendary double-play partners Joe Tinker and Johnny Evers did not speak to each other for two years. Gargantuan Boog Powell and paunchy Mickey Lolich are cited for their heft, with no mention of what they weighed. And it is maddening to be told that the career minor leaguer Steve Dalkowski was the hardest-throwing pitcher to walk the earth without reporting the speed of his fastball.

Babe Ruth, who could cuss, guzzle and whore to outdo any sailor of legend, was also the most genial and accommodating of men. He would pose for photographers in any requested position, however ridiculous or uncomfortable. Thus, in ''The Babe: A Life in Pictures,'' we see him chopping wood, riding a cow, in drag, dressed as a cop, and hanging from an exercise bar in a good imitation of an ape.

nyt_corpus_1989.har/05/07/0247902.xml	        After the summer of 1949, the Red Sox and the Yankees, afflicted by complacency, the arrogance of power and a racist policy that made them among the last of the major league teams to hire black players, lost some of their stature. The Yankees surrendered their collective personality to what Mr. Halberstam calls ''cold-blooded organizational skill.'' And the Red Sox continued to labor unavailingly to escape Sisyphean punishment for having sold Babe Ruth to the Yankees in 1920.
nyt_corpus_1989.har/05/07/0247902.xml	        By Mr. Halberstam's account, a good measure of the drama of the pennant race stemmed from a battle of opposing styles and traditions. He does his utmost to be evenhanded, but it is clear nonetheless that his primary allegiance is to the Yankees. The 1949 Yankees were physically and mentally tough, disciplined, classy and proud of a tradition of winning that went back to the era of Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. ''Everyone demanded complete effort,'' the outfielder Gene Woodling recalled. ''It was not a team where anyone ever said 'nice try' when you made a long run after a fly ball and didn't get to it.'' There was even a Yankee physical ideal: clean-cut, gentlemanly. Yogi Berra played for a while under the shadow of not looking like a Yankee, much less a ball player. (Bucky Harris, who preceded Casey Stengel as the Yankee manager, called Mr. Berra ''The Ape.'') The Red Sox - in some respects the toy of their rich owner, Tom Yawkey, who wanted them to be happy above all - tended to the freewheeling, good-old-boy, late-hours style of Jimmie Foxx, Lefty Grove and Ellis Kinder (a tradition carried on more recently by Wade Boggs). A mainstay of the 1949 team, Kinder arrived in Cleveland one morning so drunk that he had to be rolled through the train station in a wheelchair. That afternoon he pitched brilliantly in relief in both ends of a doubleheader against the Indians. ''Ellis did love a good time,'' his widow said.

A couple of times, it actually defies tradition by showing whole sequences of plays instead of unrelieved highlights; and Robert Redford's swing is maybe the best acting he's ever done. But the film violates baseball reality in too many other ways. Roy Hobbs, the mythic hero, has no teammates to speak of, his bat never breaks, and, since he is too ethereal for statistics, we don't even know where he stands in relation to Babe Ruth's record, which was a fixation during the 30's. And on and on. As Hobbs rounds the bases hemorrhaging from his old bullet wounds to win the playoff game and the pennant, all I could think was, ''No wonder the National League loses so many World Series'' - which was not what the movie wanted me to think, I know, but that's the difference between a fan and a movie.

Gone, it seems, are the days when Gary Cooper, swinging like a nervous housewife who just wants to get it over with, could be flopped from right-handed to left-handed and palmed off as the great Lou Gehrig in ''Pride of the Yankees'' (1942). For ''Major League,'' Steve Yeager, the ex-Dodger, sweated the actors until they looked like the real thing, and for the admirable ''Eight Men Out,'' D. B.

My brother, who was a combat correspondent in the Marine Corps during the battle to take Okinawa in World War II, told me that in addition to shouting (in English) ''To hell with Babe Ruth!'' ostensibly to break the marines' morale, the Japanese shouted ''To hell with Lou Gehrig!'' and ''To hell with Moe Berg!'' - this last in reference to the multilingual journeyman catcher who, because of his knowledge of Japanese, had accompanied an all-star team to Japan as player and translator, and who, because of his generosity in conducting baseball clinics for the Japanese and otherwise making himself available to them, had become a national idol. The cream of the jest, of course, was that most of the marines had never heard of Moe Berg. Incidentally, the most famous quip at Berg's expense was that he could speak 10 (or more) languages competently but couldn't hit a curveball in even one of them.  BERNARD KOGAN  Wilmette, Ill.

nyt_corpus_1989.har/06/18/0259557.xml	        HANK GREENBERG: The Story of My Life. By Hank Greenberg; Edited and with an Introduction by Ira Berkow. (Times Books, $19.95.) Had Henry Benjamin Greenberg lived to complete his autobiography, the story of his life in baseball would probably have been as flat as his big feet. Happily, his family sought the help of Ira Berkow, a New York Times sports columnist. The collaboration was unusual. Greenberg died at the age of 75 on Sept. 4, 1986. Mr. Berkow inherited 800 pages of rambling conversation that Greenberg had dictated, and edited those words into the heart of the book. Greenberg, who played for the Detroit Tigers from 1933 until 1946, with four years out for military service during World War II, relates the usual baseball lore. He tells stories of players' shenanigans, names the greats of the game and recalls his good and bad days at the plate. He was contentious during the annual contract talks and explains why. He was contemptuous of managers who coldly cut aging veterans, even Babe Ruth, from the roster. Latter-day players who outdistanced Greenberg in the record books have written similar stories. What was special about this player beyond his 6-foot 4-inch frame, dedication to the game and courtly manner? Greenberg is one of two Jewish players - Sandy Koufax is the other - to be named to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Greenberg does not deny his heritage, but he does not make much of it. It is Mr. Berkow who adds perspective and stature to Greenberg through interviews with sportswriters and the player's family, friends and colleagues. Greenberg was remembered by players and writers for his grace under the almost daily pressure of anti-Semitic vulgarities shouted by opposing teams and fans. He was regarded as the model by Jackie Robinson and other minority players who tried to concentrate on the game and ignore the viciousness of racial discrimination. Such a contribution is reason enough to celebrate Greenberg's life.

Suppose that a peeved Darryl Strawberry manages to hit 32 home runs by the All-Star Game one of these seasons, but is so unhappy playing for the Mets that they decide to trade him to an American League team, such as Toronto, during the All-Star Game break. If Strawberry hits 30 home runs for the Blue Jays during the rest of the season for a total of 62, will he be recognized as baseball's career leader for most home runs in a season?  A. He would go down as the major league leader for one season, but the American and National League leaders would not be dislodged from their places in the record book, according to the commissioner's office, which had to deal with a similar problem 28 years ago. When Roger Maris hit 61 home runs in 1961 and broke Babe Ruth's sacred mark, Maris created a quandary of Ruthian proportions because the American League played a 162-game season that year and Ruth had made his mark in the 154-game format of 1927. So the record book now lists Maris as the American League (and therefore major league) leader for 162-game seasons and Ruth as the leader for 154-game seasons. It also singles out Hack Wilson (56 homers for the Chicago Cubs in 1930) as the National League leader for a 154-game schedule and Willie Mays (52 in 1965 for the San Francisco Giants) and George Foster (52 for the Cincinnati Reds in 1977) as the National League co-leaders for a 162-game season.

Ty Cobb was not as good as his .367 career batting average, say the baseball computer analysts; if he were playing today he would hit only .289. That only proves Cobb's greatness, say the critics of such analysis - .289 is impressive hitting for a 102-year-old. Bill Starr, a minor-league player in the 1930's and owner of the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League until 1955, says that the players of the 1920's and 30's get a bum rap. It is wrong to assume that because athletes are generally faster, bigger and stronger than in the old days, baseball players necessarily are better, Mr. Starr says in ''Clearing the Bases.'' Those traits make for better football and basketball players, but baseball depends on hand skills more akin to those used in golf, and quickness rather than foot speed. The theory that a lively ball created higher batting averages in the 20's and 30's is bunk, says Mr. Starr. Rather, Babe Ruth established that hitting drew fans and a higher salary, and players altered their bats and styles in Ruth's image. Mr. Starr cranks out his own statistics to show that players of the old days managed to hit the long ball while keeping strikeouts - much more an embarrassment then than now - to a minimum. Mr. Starr emphasizes that his book is no nostalgia trip. Too bad, for as he makes these and various other cases with quotes from old-timers, the reader gets too-brief glimpses of a time when all manner of spitballs were common, owners figured one ball should last a whole game and crowds milled around the outfield during games.

But in his 22 appearances in the PGA Championship, from 1959-80, second best was the best he could do, and he did it thrice. In 1968, he finished one shot behind Boros; in 1970, he was two in back of Dave Stockton, and in 1964, he wound up three strokes short of Bobby Nichols even though Palmer's rounds of 68, 68, 69, 69, made him the only competitor in the field to break 70 in each round. Since he joined the Senior PGA Tour for players over 50 years of age in 1980, the score has evened somewhat for the player who never won a PGA Championship; Palmer has won the Senior PGA Championship twice, in 1980 and 1984.  Yankees Go Home  Q. Who holds the Yankee record for stealing home in his career?  A. Lou Gehrig. He did it 15 times, which is astonishing for such a powerful hitter, and his partner in slugging, Babe Ruth, did it 10 times, which might be even more astonishing. Throw in Ben Chapman, a Yankee outfielder in the lineup with Gehrig and Ruth from 1930-34 who also stole home 15 times in his career, and what emerges is a Yankee team glorified for its ability to pound the ball, but always a threat to swipe home plate.

Smith did it four times with the Boston Red Sox in the American League in 1967-73, and twice with the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League, 1975-76, giving him the unofficial interleague record.  Extra Hitting  Q. What is the record for extra-base hits by a batter in a season?  A. It depends on which side of the plate you're batting from. Babe Ruth, with 119 long hits, holds the major league mark, set in 1921 with the Yankees, and that's also the record for left-handed batters. Ruth had 59 home runs, 44 doubles and 16 triples (as well as 85 singles). Ruth's mark is also the American League high for a season. The National League standard belongs to Chuck Klein, also a left-hander, who achieved 59 doubles, 40 home runs and 8 triples for 107 extra-base hits with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1930.

He also contends that, based on his research, the first song written about the game was ''The Base Ball Polka,'' written in 1859, and lists the 15 musical tributes to Babe Ruth, written from 1920 through 1948, a musical record for a baseball figure.

On the other hand, only two players really matter - Babe Ruth and Ted Williams - because they dominated this particular aspect of batting, doing it seven of the nine times it was accomplished. In 1941, when he batted .406, Williams, baseball's last .400 hitter, put together a .551 on-base average, the best ever. It was so good that for the season, he finished 99 percentage points ahead of the American League's second-best performer in on-base average, Roy Cullenbine of the St. Louis Browns. Williams had 185 hits that season, including 33 doubles and 37 home runs, and walked 145 times. The Boston Red Sox outfielder also has the fourth-best on-base percentage in baseball history, .516, in 1954, and he didn't do badly in 1942 or 1947 either, when he barely failed to reach base half the time with .499 percentages.

Its order and its complexities have invited, even demanded, statistics for more than a century. ''Total Baseball'' is one of the best baseball statistics books ever. It uses the traditional statistics, accumulated though painstaking research (Ty Cobb had 4,190 hits, not 4,191), as well as new ones: the so-called sabermetrics popularized by Bill James and by John Thorn and Pete Palmer in their book, ''The Hidden Game of Baseball,'' to rate players of different eras by adjustments that reflect how the game has changed. Their computer base goes back into the last century, and using the Thorn-Palmer scheme of Linear Weights (best defined in the book, not in a short review) they determine that the best single season by a pitcher was Silver King's in 1888 with the St. Louis Browns, when he had 45 wins, 21 losses and a 1.64 e.r.a. Similarly, their numbers maintain that the 10 all-time best careers ever were those of Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Hank Aaron,Ted Williams, Willie Mays, Nap Lajoie, Walter Johnson, Cy Young, Tris Speaker and Mike Schmidt. Pick your statistic, traditional or newfangled, and look at the records of 13,000 players. Don't be put off by the 2,294 pages; the first 678 are essays, mostly forgettable.

As Cardinal manager from 1913-17, Huggins won respect more than anything else. But while managing the Yankees from 1918-29, winning became a knack. When Huggins closed a 17-year managerial career, his record was 1,413-1,134 (.555), with six pennants and three World Series titles. Ranked by achievment, Huggins would be the only one of the lawyer-managers ahead of La Russa, who in his first 12 years has won three division titles, two pennants and one World Series.

Warren admired the way Aaron went about his business. ''He plays with dignity and a quiet purposefulness,'' Warren said. ''And can he hit that ball!'' In a time when the world is changing so dramatically, for good and sometimes for bad, it may seem that sports hardly have a place.

For all its powerful black performers, the show has embarrassingly little to say about the particular experience of black people during the Depression. (Its one pungent comment on the subject comes in the form of a running gag about an unemployed actor, amusingly done by Michael Mandell.) With its surreal comic invocations of Supreme Court justices, a pair of handcuffed sisters, Babe Ruth and the First Lady, ''Romance in Hard Times'' might also have been meant as a sentimental Capra fantasy, a ''Pocketful of Miracles.'' But the tedious, resolutely unerotic love triangle drowns out the fabulist whimsy, especially since Ms. White and Mr. Derricks express their emotions in anachronistic arias reminiscent of their mock-Motown turns in ''Dreamgirls.''

William Curran, the author of ''Mitts,'' gives us a detailed and lively history of baseball in the 1920's, with chapters on Babe Ruth, Rogers Hornsby, John J. McGraw, Ty Cobb, the Chicago Cubs and the 1927 Yankees' ''Murderers' Row.'' His focus is the ''batting revolution'' that, he argues, transformed the ''scientific'' game of the 1910's into the power game of the 20's. Previously, teams struggled to score a run at a time as batters choked up on the bat to gain enough control to push the ball over the infielders' heads. In the power game, batters were encouraged to swing from the heels and, to quote one of Mr. Curran's colorful but somewhat misplaced metaphors, ''runs scored by the half dozen and base hits showered the still-new steel-and-concrete ball parks like cherry blossoms in a high wind.'' Batting averages rose an average of 40 points from 1918 to 1925. More remarkable was the increase in home runs. In 1917, Babe Ruth tied for the league lead in home runs with nine; the league record was 16. In 1919, Ruth hit 29 homers in 130 games; in 1920, he hit 54. The only losers were the pitchers, whose collective earned run average ballooned from 2.68 in 1917 to 4.33 in 1925. The hitting revolution was abetted by new rules that restricted and then prohibited trick pitches like the spitter. The so-called rabbit ball, which is usually identified as a primary cause of the hitter's ascendancy, had nothing to do it; Mr. Curran takes a full chapter to dispute angrily the theory that the owners imported a ''live'' ball to increase home run production. Mr. Curran writes well, but not well enough to hold the interest of the general reader. However, for those who thrive on stories, statistics and descriptions of past batting heroes, pennant races and World Series, ''Big Sticks'' may prove irresistible.

Bait-and-switch alert: Willie Mays is not a cult baseball player. Neither are Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle, Duke Snider, Ted Williams, Henry Aaron or Lou Gehrig, though all appear in ''Cult Baseball Players,'' an uneven collection of 60 hero-worshiping essays by writers of large and small repute. The title whets the appetite for an anthology flush with one-game wonders, flamboyant flameouts, assorted oddballs and box-score cameos; the subtitle backs off that promise, allowing the aforementioned Hall of Famers to horn in. In fact, the only one-game wonder in the book is one of the writers: Larry Colton, who pitched two innings for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1968. But yes, the expected eccentrics do make the lineup: blunderful Marv Throneberry, Dick (Dr. Strangeglove) Stuart, Mark (The Bird) Fidrych, the minor-league fireballer Steve Dalkowski, the backward baserunner Jimmy Piersall, the starlet-struck Bo Belinsky, the catcher turned World War II spy Moe Berg. The best profiles establish a personal connection between writer and subject. The Washington Post sportswriter Thomas Boswell enjoyed two unblemished encounters with his hero, Roy Sievers. The film director John Sayles tells why he adopted Dick Stuart as his soul mate in fielding futility. The actor John Lithgow says he ''first encountered the entire concept of 'biceps' in connection with Big Klu,'' the sleeveless Cincinnati slugger Ted Kluszewski. The book's editor, Danny Peary, the author of ''Cult Movies,'' waxes long-winded about his own idol, Vic Power, then appends a 22-page transcript of an interview he did with the slick-fielding first baseman. Mr. Power's comments on life as a black-skinned Puerto Rican big-leaguer in the 1950's make some of the best reading in the book. They will enlighten a generation of fans who never saw him play. They don't, however, make him a cult baseball player.

And when he told this to a group of jaded sportswriters gathered for an evening briefing, no one snickered.

Unlike Ueberroth, who seemed more comfortable marketing the game than watching it, Vincent has pledged to try to get to all 26 major-league ball parks this season. During the marathon labor talks, he had Scott Sanderson, the Oakland Athletics pitcher and one of the players' representatives, show him the grip for a split-fingered fastball. And before a settlement was reached, he asked all the players present to sign a ball that now is displayed in his office next to the one autographed by Babe Ruth. ''This job is not like running a manufacturing business or a car dealership or a movie company,'' Vincent says, swiveling about in his leather office chair and plucking a cigar from a box behind him.

Dividing that amount by 600 times at bat would yield a .500 slugging percentage, which would be considerably short of the major league record for a season, .847, set by Babe Ruth for the 1920 Yankees (73 singles, 36 doubles, 9 triples, 54 home runs).

nyt_corpus_1991.har/02/17/0423925.xml	        Washington and London, at Odds in the Air  All's fair in love, war and international airline negotiations. Disputes over airline rights can divide even friends as close as Britain and the United States. Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner rejected British Airways' proposed fare cuts to the United States last Tuesday. Britain had blocked the sale by Pan Am and Trans World Airlines, both desperate for cash, of several London routes to Heathrow airport that United and American Airlines want to buy. Sir Colin Marshall, chief executive of British Airways, flew into New York himself last week to display solicitude for the ailing airlines. The dispute is "not about knocking Pan Am or T.W.A. out of business altogether," he said. He also urged timid Americans to resume traveling abroad; those who don't risk losing business, he said. What British Airways actually seeks are broader operating rights in the United States, said American analysts. Problem is, that sort of deal might normally take a year to work out; T.W.A. and Pan Am need agreements within a few months.  Oddball Salary Inequities  When Babe Ruth was asked, about 60 years ago, why he deserved $80,000 when President Hoover only made $75,000, Ruth's legendary response was, "I had a better year than he did." A week ago, Roger Clemens signed a four-year contract giving him a record average of $5.4 million a year; President Bush draws $200,000. Clemens won 21 games, holding opponents to an average of less than two runs a game. George Bush showed quick reflexes in the Persian Gulf but bobbled the tax issue. So Clemens did have the better year. But 27 times better? Enough so that the cost of a single Clemens victory more than covers Bush's salary for an entire season? And the President certainly outplayed, say, Jeff Parrett, the Atlanta Braves pitcher, who recently settled for $855,000 after winning five, losing 10. Memo to team owners wanting to economize: draft George, the former Yale baseball captain, when his Washington contract is up. Alcohol-Fed Inflation Economists have found another fuel to blame for increasing wholesale inflation. A record 5.9 percent jump in alcohol prices raised the core inflation rate in January by five-tenths of 1 percent. Higher alcohol taxes do not figure into producer prices, but many manufacturers took the chance to raise their own prices. Some economists said that, even after accounting for liquor costs, the rising core rate would keep the Federal Reserve from easing further. "The Fed will rest on its oars for at least a couple more weeks," said Irwin L. Kellner of Manufacturers Hanover Trust. The broader inflation rate, including food and energy, fell one-tenth of 1 percent, as oil prices declined. Golden Arch of Catfish?  McDonald's believes it has found a recipe for Southern success: The Crispy Catfish Sandwich, a 2.3-ounce patty with lettuce and tangy sauce on a bun. McDonald's plans to sell it at 214 outlets in Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Kentucky and Tennessee. Restaurants that specialize in catfish are hardly trembling. Don Buckner, general manager of Hall's on the River in Winchester, Ky., described McDonald's seafood sandwiches as "block pieces of fish" -- suitable for someone who would otherwise have a quarter-pounder. His $9.95 all-you-can-eat catfish dinner includes vegetables and hush puppies, he added. No hush puppies at McDonald's, said a spokeswoman, convinced that Southern customers will accept french fries. Competition for Cellular Lines All that static on the cellular phone lines is coming from aggrieved duopolists. The Federal Communications Commission decided on Wednesday to allow a new form of mobile service in six cities, including New York. Radio dispatch companies for taxis and delivery services will be able to squeeze thousands of other customers into their narrow slices of the radio spectrum. Cellular services that have flourished under rules allowing only two in each city could find competition heating up. Analysts doubt the new service, to be offered initially by Fleet Call Inc. of Bloomfield, N.J., will match cellular's flexibility and features. But the cellular industry called the decision unfair and threatened a fight. Production Declines Ease The slump in industrial output continued for a fourth month in January, but the decline was a moderate four-tenths of 1 percent after much steeper drops in the two previous months. Some economists said the report hints that the worst of the recession is past. But industries used only 79.9 percent of their capacity, the least in four years. In Brief A seven-tenths of 1 percent decline in already lean business inventories in December gave economists hope that any increase in demand would result in higher production.

Ned Garver pitched for the 1951 St. Louis Browns and won 20 of his team's 54 games that season. He developed arm trouble, and although he had a solid 14-year career in the big leagues, he never approached his 1951 form. Billy Grabarkewitz of the Los Angeles Dodgers, who batted .376 for the first three months of the 1970 season, castigates meddlesome coaches who tried to change his batting style during that hot streak. Wes Parker, also of the Dodgers, decided that the Spartan life he led during his career season of 1970 wasn't worth the price and retired from the game two years later. Though his play in those two years was solid, it never approached the standard he set in 1970, when he batted .319.

They include accounts of Walter Johnson's only World Series, Babe Ruth's called-shot home run, Joe DiMaggio's hitting streak, Willie Mays's celebrated over-the-shoulder catch and the "worst to first" World Series last year.

That day I understood that the process in itself is the reward." Mixed in are fascinating facts. Sunday games were played only in Chicago, St. Louis and Cincinnati until 1933, when the 13 other teams overcame religious objections. The Cincinnati Reds introduced baseball under the lights in 1935. The Yankees introduced numbers on uniforms in 1929, and Mr. Seaver witnessed a change when he joined the New York Mets in 1967: "I was there when the flannel turned to double knit."

In the late 1920's, Andy Cohen, a New York Giant second baseman (from El Paso, of all places), was the first Jewish ballplayer promoted as a drawing card on the basis of ethnic identity. However, beginning in the 1930's, Hank Greenberg in Detroit produced the key commodity -- home runs -- that attracts fans and makes baseball stars transcendent. In 1934, Greenberg drew attention to his Jewishness by refusing to play an important game against the Yankees on Yom Kippur, even though he was the leading hitter on a Tigers team headed for the World Series. The degree to which he was depicted as a hero (for being "true to his religion") may seem odd now, but it altered the viewpoints of many during a time when overt anti-Semitism was a social norm. Then, in 1938, Greenberg came within two home runs of matching Babe Ruth's season record of 60.

Summoning up a Salt Lake City boyhood, circa 1962, his screenplay (co-written by Robert Gunter) introduces a nostalgic adult narrator remembering a shadowy, sinister new stepfather, just as "Radio Flyer" did. But this time the tone is lighter as Scotty Smalls (Tom Guiry) moves into a new neighborhood and tries to make new friends. He immediately finds eight of them, kids who do everything together, from delivering wisecracks to worshipping baseball. Scotty initially has trouble fitting in with these sandlot players, since he has only dimly heard of Babe Ruth and thinks the name must belong to a girl.

James Earl Jones turns up late in the film as the boys confront this particular demon, and he figures in a denouement that is especially absurd.

Although Schueler conceded that he regretted not extensively scouting Wickman and Jean, he said: "I'd make that trade again." Why? Because, Schueler said, Perez failed as a starter in Chicago, he is unimpressed with Wickman and he is unsure if Jean will produce in the majors. But Sax, now a third-string second baseman because of shoddy defense, belittled the trade. "If I was in their shoes," he said, "I would be saying, 'Why did we trade a couple of good pitchers for this guy?'

nyt_corpus_1994.har/04/10/0679388.xml	        At the beginning of the 1904 baseball season, an amateur photographer wandered onto the playing field at the Polo Grounds and asked the star pitcher of the New York Giants to pose. Christy Mathewson obliged with a demonstration of his "body swing" -- now called a windup -- and Charles M. Conlon embarked on a 38-year career in which he virtually invented the iconography of the national pastime. Through 1942, Conlon (1868-1945) spent his summers carting his bulky Graflex camera (which until 1934 used glass negatives) to various ball parks to capture images of the players in action and in repose -- images so vivid and fresh that "ballplayers from another era are standing in the sunshine of the 20th century," as Neal McCabe and Constance McCabe write in BASEBALL'S GOLDEN AGE: The Photographs of Charles M. Conlon (Abrams, $29.95). Conlon remained an amateur photographer -- he was a proofreader at The New York Evening Telegram -- but his avocation made him "de facto the official photographer of baseball," one whose visions of the sport were seen annually for decades in Baseball magazine, the annual baseball guides, The Sporting News and baseball textbooks. Conlon once reminisced, "The fun I have had, the days in the open, the associations, the confidences I have enjoyed -- well, you can't buy those things." The 205 shots Constance McCabe, a photography conservator, has chosen from the 8,000 surviving Conlon negatives convey the eternally fresh wonder a spectator might feel at being in the open air alongside John McGraw squatting by third base, or watching Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig warm up on the sidelines. Thanks to excellent production, and a brilliant job of design by Carol Robson, great names from the recesses of baseball antiquity come vividly to life, from Honus Wagner, Napoleon Lajoie, Ty Cobb, Joe Tinker, Johnny Evers, Frank Chance and Walter Johnson to Grover Cleveland Alexander, Jimmie Foxx, Rogers Hornsby and Tris Speaker. Ms. McCabe's brother, Neal, brought his lifelong enthusiasm for baseball to his research on Conlon and his subjects; the text offers delightful nuggets of information about the innumerable firsts that Conlon recorded: the first American League umpire, the first batter in the World Series, the first photo on a baseball bubble-gum card.

Nicholas Dawidoff, a contributor to Sports Illustrated, The New Republic and other magazines, has written a painstakingly researched yet compact biography of the bizarre catcher -- a major league ballplayer, Princeton graduate, amateur linguist, ladies' man, raconteur, professional freeloader, lawyer, quiz show contestant and spy. The book is a wild ride through history, combining characters like Heisenberg, Ted Williams, the O.S.S.'s Wild Bill Donovan, Babe Ruth, Albert Einstein, Julia Child, Nelson Rockefeller and Chico Marx. It's filled with brilliant scientists, lascivious outfielders and truculent geisha girls. As a biography it appears to lack only one element: a hero. But it has something better. It has Moe Berg.

"The Catcher Was a Spy" is relentlessly entertaining, and Mr. Dawidoff's style is so unobtrusive that you forget he's there. One story almost justifies the cover price by itself. It involves Babe Ruth, a geisha house and Moe Berg's knowledge of the katakana, the Japanese phonetic alphabet. One must admire the author's honesty and work ethic.

Part of Roger Maris's motivation in chasing Babe Ruth's home-run record in 1961, successfully as it turned out, had been simply to spite the fans who were booing him for excelling Mr. Mantle. (Yankee management, incidentally, never saw fit to reward Maris for his accomplishment.) Johnny Sain, despite his great value as a pitching coach, antagonized managers because he tended to create "a separate team of pitchers whose loyalty was only to him," Mr. Halberstam writes.

nyt_corpus_1995.har/08/20/0783878.xml	        "I can't remember anything that happened before I had a baseball in my hand," Rogers Hornsby once said. The career of baseball's greatest right-handed hitter is well told by Charles C. Alexander, whose previous books include biographies of Ty Cobb and John McGraw and "Our Game: An American Baseball History." Hornsby batted .424 in 1924, the highest batting average of the 20th century, and as player-manager he led the St. Louis Cardinals to a World Series triumph over Babe Ruth and the Yankees in 1926. Off the field, as Mr. Alexander chronicles, Hornsby was an unrepentant gambler who made a habit of biting every hand that fed him, and there were many: he played for or coached seven major league teams and had stints in the minors and even in Mexico. His obsession with the game sabotaged his personal life; Hornsby married three times, and when his first son was killed in an airplane crash, the young man's mother requested that Hornsby not attend the funeral. Mr. Alexander does an excellent job of describing this loner, who habitually killed time on the road by sitting in hotel lobbies watching guests check in and out -- something to fill the void before the next game.

In IDOLS OF THE GAME: A Sporting History of the American Century (Turner, $23.95), Robert Lipsyte, a sports columnist for The New York Times, and Peter Levine, a professor of history at Michigan State University, try to pinpoint exactly how and why Ruth and 15 other outstanding athletes metamorphosed into cultural icons. Books about the lionization of sports figures are nothing new, but Mr. Lipsyte and Mr. Levine have constructed an interesting premise: they contend that their subjects are literally symbols of different periods in 20th-century America. Arnold Palmer, Vince Lombardi and Mickey Mantle represent not only excellence on the playing field but also "the promise of post-World War II America." Billie Jean King and  Muhammad Ali are not only great competitors but also are emblematic of "the turbulent 60's, a time in which sports as well as the larger culture confronted  the inequities of race, sex and class." Placing coaches and athletes on cultural time lines is a risky proposition at best -- as is arguing that the contribution of a certain select group reflects the myriad forces at work in society at a particular time. There is something about sports that defies rigid classification. But one does not have to agree totally with the authors to enjoy their book. The description of John L. Sullivan's 75-round bare-knuckle championship bout against Jake Kilrain -- in 115-degree heat, no less -- is worth the price of the book in itself.

But after closely studying the faded script and seeing the scrawled signature of Babe Ruth, the viewer senses a glow around the ball. Smaller than a regulation-size ball, the old orb inspires awe. "He could've blown the cover off this one," said Joseph M. Accetta, a lawyer on  the staff of Westchester County Surrogate Court Judge Albert Emanuelli, who is hearing a lawsuit involving the 1938 baseball. "He was one of the top five players who ever played the game. He hit 60 home runs with a dead ball," said Mr. Accetta, who is responsible for the ball's safekeeping. For Mr. Accetta, a baseball fan whose office is hung with framed mementos of baseball's greats, the lawsuit is a joy. He rattles off statistics and anecdotes without pause. For example, he cited the 1932 World Series game between the Yankees and the Chicago Cubs when Ruth, the Sultan of Swat, with two strikes against him, pointed to center field with his bat and proceeded to place the ball there. "He had great agility for a guy his size, tremendous power; he was a great athlete," said Mr. Accetta, a 30-year-old with a reverential attitude toward baseball history. He acquired his love of the game's past growing up in Queens,  where he listened to older men talk about baseball in New York during the 1940's and '50's. "I had expected a shiny white ball with the Babe's signature on it," said Mr. Accetta, who retrieved the baseball from a safe in the judge's chambers. "At first, it's a letdown when you see it. It's not in terrific shape. The cover is split in two places." Mr. Accetta, who coaches Little League and plays in two softball leagues, added, "It was even played with." But the baseball in question was not played with by Ruth. Boys of long ago played with it at least once, Mr. Accetta said. The autographed baseball is most likely a novelty item of the kind sold in gift  shops and candy stores for play by youngsters, said Greg Schwalenberg, curator of the Babe Ruth Birthplace and Museum in Baltimore. "Today's ball is the same dimension and weight as back then." Even though Ruth played in what is known as the "dead-ball era," evidence to support that contention is hard to come by, Mr. Schwalenberg said. A baseball, which is still hand-stitched, is a cushioned cork center with a leather cover held together with 108 stitches and is 3 inches in diameter, 9 to 9 1/4 inches in circumference and 5 to 5 1/4 ounces in weight. "Later, the ball became livelier, apparently it had more of a pop to it; it may  be that they were wound tighter inside," Mr. Schwalenberg said. Paul Ventry, a doctor in Potomac, Md., was a 10-year-old in 1938 when he stopped with his father, Victor, at the Peekskill train station. Standing there waiting for a train was Babe Ruth. Young Paul ran to a nearby store and bought a baseball. He got back in time to get the Babe's autograph. For the next half-century or so, the ball sat in a breakfront in the Ventry's Peekskill living room. According to court documents, Dr. Ventry claims that the baseball was a gift to him from his father, who died in 1973. At that time,  Dr. Ventry took the ball to his home. After their mother, Catherine R., died in  1992, his sister, Catherine V., claimed the baseball was family property and ought to be sold. A legal wrangle has ensued. "I delivered the baseball," said Joseph A. Scutieri, a lawyer for Dr. Ventry, referring to handing it over to Mr. Accetta. When asked whether he felt it in the palm of his hand, Mr. Scutieri said, "No, I didn't even do that." But like Mr. Accetta, Mr. Scutieri's work is more fun these days. "This case combines two things that I love, sports and my job," Mr. Scutieri said. "I'd love to make a living playing baseball. That's what I do in my free time, and here I get paid to argue what a Babe Ruth baseball is worth." This particular ball may not be worth very much, however. "It's a little dirty and worn," Mr. Scutieri said. "It's not in the shape the collectors want it to be, mint condition, whether it's baseball cards or baseballs. They don't want you touching anything or handling it. They want it in plastic wrap." For comparison, Mr. Scutieri offered information on a 1927 baseball, a memento from the same year Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs. "There's a 1927 baseball signed by the Yankee team, Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, the best team ever," Mr. Scutieri said. "That one is worth $14,000." He added, "The numbers on this ball are as high as $10,000, but it's not in very good shape." Despite the baseball's "priceless sentimental value," as stated in court papers, Dr. Ventry claims the baseball is worth about $100. Born George Herman Ruth in 1895, the Baltimore native played from 1920 to 1934 for the Yankees, in the House That Ruth Built, otherwise known as Yankee Stadium. In 1935, he played for the Boston Braves, retiring after one season. In 1938, the year the baseball was signed, he coached at first base for the Brooklyn Dodgers from June 19 to the end of the season. He hoped to be hired as  manager of the team, but Leo Durocher got the job. It was the last time the Babe wore a baseball uniform. Before his death in 1948, from throat cancer at 53, he  played golf tournaments and went on fishing and hunting trips. "The exact reason he was in Peekskill is not known," Mr. Schwalenberg said. Both lawyers say that the baseball became a focal point after a dispute arose between the brother and sister -- who is a lawyer in the town of New Windsor in  Orange County -- over the mother's insurance policies. A third sibling, Barbara  Ventry Magee, is not named in the dispute. Last summer Judge Emanuelli ruled that the baseball was part of the Ventry estate. But Mr. Scutieri persuaded the judge to reopen the case after he proved  that his client was improperly served with the original court documents and did  not have enough time to reply. Judge Emanuelli is expected to rule on the motion soon. For Mr. Accetta, the day the baseball leaves his care could be a sad one. "At some point, it has to go," he said.

Cleveland's Albert Belle was on pace to hit 50 home runs for the second consecutive season. Only one other hitter has ever done that: Babe Ruth.

(And the argument that basketball and football have siphoned off significant numbers of great athletes is nonsense.

On a summer day in 1917, Willard's dad pulls a red roadster out of a ditch. The strapping young driver turns out to be the best pitcher in baseball, the Boston Red Sox's Babe Ruth, who says, ''Sorry I was going so damned -- darned -- fast,'' and gives young Willard a baseball glove. Eighteen years later, on opening day of the Babe's last year in baseball, Willard meets him again, in the locker room of the Boston Braves, and introduces him to his 10-year-old daughter, Ruth. With the help of Barry Moser's sun-washed watercolors, the poet Donald Hall evokes the long-ago time when baseball was a constant hum in our daily lives, connecting one generation to the next.

Before the home opener, the team would honor Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris -- the M & M boys, still only 46 and 43, respectively. It was Maris's first time back in Yankee Stadium since he had been all but booed off the field for not being the new incarnation of Babe Ruth.

When it opened, on April 18, 1923, Babe Ruth hit a home run. At that moment, New York City was a beacon of great baseball and of entrepreneurial capitalism.

That seems a growing sentiment, but it was not a popular one with Mr. Povich, who covered Ruth and his exploits. ''To judge McGwire a better home run hitter than Ruth at a moment when McGwire is exactly 300 home runs short of the Babe's career output is, well, a stretch,'' he wrote.

''Each team, for example, had one dominating player -- Russell for the Celtics, Jordan for the Bulls -- plus superb role players around them. But there is an X factor. That is Michael Jordan. He's an incredible player, the greatest player I've ever seen. He's the best offensive player I've ever seen,  and his defense is second to none. He's the modern-day Babe Ruth.''

nyt_corpus_1998.har/07/01/1028738.xml	        McGwire may be able to blast the ball deeper and more often than any of his competitors, making him the odds-on favorite to catch Maris. What McGwire didn't want to catch was the debilitating waves of attention, the sort that caused Maris anything but joy in 1961, when that Yankee great eclipsed Babe Ruth's record of 60.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/07/05/1029439.xml	        McGwire's swing is designed to produce home runs (and strikeouts). Anything else -- doubles, singles, the occasional ground ball -- is an accident. And sometime this September, barring injury, he'll probably break the most recognizable record in American sports: Roger Maris's 61 home runs in a season, which in 1961 supplanted the previous most recognizable record, Babe Ruth's 60 home runs in a season. (Ruth's record lasted 34 years; Maris's has now lasted 37.)
nyt_corpus_1998.har/07/05/1029439.xml	        All great sluggers have their own distinctive swings. Babe Ruth began with a graceful stride toward the ball followed by a whiplash of wrists and forearms that left him twisted like a pretzel when he missed. Stan Musial started from a low crouch and uncurled a fluid stroke that still has hitting coaches going back to old films. Mickey Mantle exploded in a violent wrench of his torso, wrists and arms, resulting in a follow-through so powerful that the bat would often slam into his back after a miss.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/07/05/1029439.xml	        * McGwire and Babe Ruth are the only players to have back-to-back seasons with 50 or more home runs. This August, in all likelihood, McGwire will become only the second player (after Ruth) to have more than two 50-plus home-run seasons. If he had not cut short his rookie season to see his son born, McGwire almost certainly would have surpassed his total of 49 home runs and would now be ready to become the second player (after Ruth) with four seasons of 50 or more home runs.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/07/05/1029439.xml	        * This season, McGwire's slugging percentage -- total bases collected on hits divided by at-bats -- has hovered around .800. The highest mark in history is Babe Ruth's .847 in 1920. Lou Gehrig's best was .765 in 1927; Ted Williams managed .735 in 1941.

Because it was invented and long owned by Babe Ruth, who hit 60 home runs in 1927, Maris has always seemed an interloper to some. By 1961, the season had grown by eight games, clouding Maris's achievement.

His father had replaced him as the pitcher, sending him to shortstop, and when the boy stopped crying, he realized he couldn't see home plate. McGwire now has 20/500 vision, which he corrects with contact lenses. He strikes out about once every 4.5 plate appearances (at-bats plus walks), compared with 1 in 7.6 for Babe Ruth when he hit 60 home runs in 1927, and 1 in 10.2 for Maris in 1961.

His prodigious skills and gregarious, larger-than-life personality transcended the sport, making him an authentic American folk hero. ''I swing big, with everything I've got; I hit big or I miss big,'' Ruth once said in what could be a suitable epitaph for his eventful life. ''I like to live as big as I can.''

Spectacular fielding plays are fun to watch, and a no-hitter is a rare thrill, but nothing quite captures the imagination like a home run. In a recent tribute to Babe Ruth's magnificent 1927 season, when he hit 60 home runs, Sports Illustrated suggested that Ruth had singlehandedly changed the face of the game, elevating the home run from ''its relatively modest role into baseball's most dramatic event and a significant force in determining the outcome of a game.'' The sluggers are also good for baseball's balance sheet. The Cardinals are drawing capacity crowds despite a disappointing season, and wherever they go, Sosa and McGwire attract thousands of people who would otherwise have stayed home.

Yankee Stadium and the West Side Club's stadium represented two faces of the sports coin. Both opened in 1923, to take advantage of crowds eager to see one of the era's great sports heroes. Babe Ruth was a throwaway Baltimore kid who refined his game in the schoolyard of an orphan asylum and openly indulged gargantuan and socially tolerated appetites.

nyt_corpus_1998.har/09/08/1044841.xml	        Sammy Sosa was a hero here in his baseball-crazed homeland long before he and Mark McGwire began their pursuit of Babe Ruth and Roger Maris. So when the Cubs and the Cardinals squared off this afternoon in St. Louis with Maris's major league home run record up for grabs, it was as if 8 million people had dropped whatever they were doing to root for him.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/09/08/1044862.xml	        The signals are that this is for everybody, for Mr. and Mrs. America, for the people in the Caribbean, for the family of Roger Maris, for the memory of Babe Ruth, for the people who buy tickets and sweat in the stands, for anybody who admires grace under pressure.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/09/08/1044885.xml	        McGwire's record-tying home run came two days after another first-inning home run tied him with Babe Ruth at 60. McGwire's 61st came in his team's 144th game (including one tie), whereas it took Maris 163 games (also one tie) to surpass Ruth. Because he broke Ruth's total well before his team's 154th game -- the length of the season when Ruth played -- McGwire should not face any talk of an asterisk in regards to surpassing Ruth, an issue that bedeviled Maris.

The balls being pitched to McGwire and Sosa are specially coded so that baseball officials can tell which are the ones hit into the stands. ''The other day,'' McGwire said, referring to No. 60, ''it was a No. 3 ball. No. 3 was Babe Ruth. I'm the third guy in the history of the game to hit 60 home runs, and I hit it on the third pitch. If that's not fate, I don't know what it is.''

When McGwire hit his 61st on Labor Day, surpassing Babe Ruth, nobody seemed happier than Sosa. The only question mark has been the controversy over legal muscle-building supplements, especially in McGwire's case, but the fans and his fellow players do not seem to care. Supplements do not teach the art of hitting a baseball, and for that reason cannot account for the fact that Mark McGwire has become the most consistent home run hitter since Ruth. His is an amazing accomplishment, and with any luck baseball can find ways to build on it.

Now I've got my Playstation Hooters All-Star Babe '99 CD-ROM game to promote.  King: So many areas to cover. Let's start with Mark McGwire. You know him?  Ruth: Sure.  King: Great guy, good friend, frequent guest.  Ruth: A 6-foot-6 inch weenie. What's he swing, a 34-ounce bat? I showed him the stick I hit 60 with. Fifty ounces. Big wimp couldn't lift it. Whined like Ty Cobb when he didn't get invited to my 50th birthday party at Nathan's.  King: Amazing. Have you talked to Sammy Sosa?  Ruth: Talk to him? He's wearing my lucky cup from 1927.  King: Babe, you played fat. Why?  Ruth: I'm an endomorph, kid. It's my body type. I couldn't help it. Dr. Dean Ornish helped me learn not to hate myself for it.  King: So it wasn't the hot dogs?  Ruth: Ah, that was a lot of hype. Sportswriters saw me eat a dozen dogs between innings and thought that was all I ate. Mostly I ate baby carrots and soy burgers.  King: Supermodel food but still a porker. Amazing. Lou Gehrig. You hated him.  Ruth: Only after his mother made me a sauerbraten with cabbage that put me in a slump in '31. Couldn't lift a bat or a woman for a week.  King: Slugging and sweet talk with the one and only Babe Ruth. We'll be back.  (Begin video clip: William Bendix in a scene from ''The Babe Ruth Story.'')  King: Lots of critics think that was the worst sports movie ever.  Ruth: Can't disagree. But did you see ''Baseketball''? I had to hear Bob Costas talk about how hard his nipples were. But I loved ''Happy Gilmore.'' Adam Sandler just kills me.  King: Why has nobody portrayed Babe Ruth well on the silver screen?  Ruth: I thought John Goodman would be great. But talk about endomorphic! He was 70 pounds too fat playing me when I was 40 pounds overweight. And I'll tell you, I wasn't fat as a kid. But that movie made me look like a hippo at 15.  King: You were great as you in ''Pride of the Yankees.'' If Babe Ruth could choose an actor to play Babe Ruth, who would it be?  Ruth: Pacino. Who else?  King: Great choice. Good friend. Frequent guest. Columbus, Ohio, you're talking to Babe Ruth.  Caller: Hi, Babe. What do you think is the worst trade ever?  Ruth: When that bum Steinbrenner traded Jay Buhner for Ken Phelps. How could he trade a future superstar for a guy who was out of baseball in two years?  King: Walla Walla, Washington, hello.  Caller: Babe, I hear you were depressed because nobody asked you to manage in the majors. But you seem happy now. What's your secret?  Ruth: St. John's Wort. And I read the ''Don't Sweat the Small Stuff'' books.  King: Let's go back. You grew up in Baltimore. Orphanage life tough?  Ruth: Nah, I loved it. Learned baseball there. Played the recorder in the St. Mary's marching band.  King: You were musically inclined?  Ruth: Kid, you think all I did was hit home runs? I had a liberal arts education, short as it was.  King: Did you have any quibbles with the Modern Library's list of the greatest 100 books ever?  Ruth: No Toni Morrison. No Wally Lamb. No Dick Schaap.  King: Me, I'd have voted for Wilt Chamberlain's memoir. Babe, what do you think -- Yankee Stadium on the West Side?  Ruth: Kid, I live on the West Side and I don't want it there. Too much traffic. And a billion dollars? Cripes, I built the first one for $2.5 million.  King: So you're for keeping it in the Bronx?  Ruth: I didn't build it to move it, Larry.  King: You ever meet Rudy Giuliani?  Ruth: Only long enough to sell him a cap with some old sweat on it for 50 grand. He thought it was mine. It was really Wally Pipp's.  King: Don't ever be a stranger, buddy. The name is Babe Ruth. What a mensch. Tomorrow night from Washington, William Bennett and Little Richard. Good night.

Scott LaPiedra, who died in the line of duty a year earlier, Giuliani drew inspiration from a plaque on the wall commemorating a firefighter who died at Iwo Jima, and compared firefighters to soldiers in war. ''I'd like you to know why we put you through this ordeal,'' he said, turning to the captain's wife and children and talking with that odd lisp that makes him seem almost flannel-tongued. ''We do it because this is the way in our society, in our culture, we inspire men. . . . We have heroes to convince ordinary people that they can do extraordinary things out of love for other people.''

He didn't just break the record; he obliterated it. Whacking a 509-foot home run here, a 501-foot home run there, McGwire slugged 19 more home runs. When Maris broke Babe Ruth's legendary record, he squeaked by it by one. After McGwire reached 62, he hit 8 more home runs.

Still, both he and Sosa, who hit 66 last season, must be deriving some private pleasure from the fact that they are once again lighting up the major leagues with a home run race that may not have quite the electricity of last year's chase but, statistically speaking, is every bit as impressive. By Sunday night, Sosa had 51 homers and McGwire 50. At this rate, both will again exceed Babe Ruth's mark of 60 home runs for a 154-game season and Roger Maris's total of 61 for the modern 162-game season.

Once Roger Bannister broke that seemingly impenetrable barrier in 1954, a lot of runners broke it. But for now, the only people with a shot at 60 or more homers are the same two who did it last year. Their nearest pursuer in the National League is Houston's Jeff Bagwell, with 37 homers through the weekend. In the American League, Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. had 38.

Many of the uniforms are signed; they include those worn by Cap Anson for the 1888 Chicago White Stockings, Jim Thorpe for the 1918 New York Giants and Jackie Robinson when he played for Kansas City of the Negro leagues in 1946; others belonged to Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Willie Mays and Pete Rose.

When the Yankees of another era won their 11th straight, they did it in what turned out to be one of the most memorable games in World Series history. It was the third game in 1932, and it was the one in which Babe Ruth did or did not point to the center-field bleachers at Wrigley Field, calling the home run he would then hit against Charlie Root.

Babe Ruth's and Mickey Mantle's faces are rendered the most accurately on their granite monuments; Don Mattingly's the least. As you stroll around the stadium during the game -- well, you can't really stroll, or stand too long in one place, for the crowd will knock you down -- you'll need to be a Wallenda to traverse the upper deck walkways, they are so narrow. The concourses between levels are so narrow that on the loge level, it is possible to be pinned, arms flailing, against an iron gate while waiting on a snack bar line.

He heard Paul Simon honor Joe DiMaggio in verse, from the very space the departed DiMaggio once roamed. He saw Yogi Berra come home to throw out the first ball on opening day. After Clemens warmed up last night, he went out to commune with Babe Ruth's memorial in Monument Park.

Clemens finished warming up in the bullpen, stepped among the monuments beyond the outfield fence and pressed his right palm against the bronze image of Babe Ruth, then walked across the Yankee Stadium field, fans roaring when they saw him. It was a blustery fall night, the evening moon was red-orange; this is Clemens's favorite time of year, and this was the day he had been waiting for, Torre said before the game, ''for a very long time.''

And when Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis saved baseball after the 1919 Chicago Black Sox scandal (with a big assist from Babe Ruth) he made gambling the only capital crime in the Major League Agreement.

Ruth then hammered a solo shot off the Cubs' Charlie Root that the film shows, for the first time, landing in faraway center field. Then, Ruth rounds the bases, making mocking gestures to the bench jockeys on the Cubs who were riding him mercilessly.

The pick that would have seemed breathtakingly radical when he actually was the world's most famous person now seems a safe bet. Never as economically important as Jordan and once considered far more of a moral danger than Sprewell, Ali has been tamed by disease and new times. He seems to be celebrated mostly for his nostalgia value rather than his long-gone power to shake up the world. While Jordan and Babe Ruth were probably his closest rivals, a very strong case for the century's m.v.p. could be made for Billie Jean King. Her impact on sports -- think women, promotion, populism and professionalism -- has been enormous and unique.

If that record can be discounted as a fluke, the record-holder before Babe Ruth made home runs his province beginning in 1919 was Harry Stovey, a first baseman, who hit 14 home runs for Philadelphia in 1883.

This unabashed valentine to baseball's Hall of Fame slugger demonstrates how little mankind and some of its sports figures have advanced since the 1930's and 40's and reminds us how the persistence of bigotry stains a nation founded on ideals like religious tolerance. The 30's and 40's were the heyday of Greenberg, a son of Jewish immigrants who came out of the Bronx to star with the Detroit Tigers, threaten Babe Ruth's home run record and become the first man to win most valuable player awards at two positions, first base and left field. In blazing his trail into the Hall of Fame, the tall, handsome Greenberg became a target of anti-Semites. But his stardom, his innate decency, his work ethic and his World War II record made him a beacon of hope to many Jews. Taken as a whole, the documentary is faithful to its title, valuable as history and resonant with meaning for today (Lawrence Van Gelder).

nyt_corpus_2000.har/02/04/1173695.xml	        ''EYE OF THE BEHOLDER,'' starring Ewan McGregor and Ashley Judd. Directed by Stephan Elliott (R, 105 minutes). Mr. McGregor is a British surveillance expert and Ms. Judd the serial-killing femme fatale he falls in love with (while observing her kill a boyfriend) in this ludicrous psycho-thriller. As Mr. McGregor's character, known only as the Eye, follows the object of his obsession from city to city, the movie tries futilely to capture some of the mystique of ''Vertigo.'' But the film, by the director best known for ''The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,'' is so garish, disjointed and incoherent that it feels like an extended music video posing as a movie (Stephen Holden).  ''FANTASIA/2000,'' with James Levine and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and introductions by Steve Martin, Bette Midler, Mr. Levine, Itzhak Perlman, James Earl Jones, Angela Lansbury, Quincy Jones and Penn and Teller. Various directors (G, 75 minutes). The  millennial version of Disney's 1940 groundbreaking fusion of animation and classical music includes seven new segments and keeps one from the original film (the wonderful ''Sorcerer's Apprentice,'' starring Mickey Mouse). Despite the science-fiction title and the Imax-size screen on which it is shown, ''Fantasia/2000'' is more backward-looking than futuristic. The two best segments are ''Rhapsody in Blue,'' a witty Manhattan-in-the-Jazz-Age homage to the caricaturist Al Hirschfeld set to the music of Gershwin, and the finale (set to Stravinsky's ''Firebird'' Suite), in which a cometlike sprite whooshes around the globe explosively creating, destroying and renewing the planet's life forms. Celebrity introductions lend the film the feel of a deluxe corporate promotion. At the Sony Imax Theater, Broadway at 68th Street, (Holden).  ''GIRL, INTERRUPTED,'' starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie. Directed by James Mangold (R, 120 minutes). Except for being several years too old for the role, Winona Ryder, an actress who oozes high-strung intelligence, is ideally cast as Susanna Kaysen, a college-age girl who lands in a Massachusetts mental institution in 1967 after a halfhearted suicide attempt. (The movie is based on Ms. Kaysen's memoir.) The period details are perfect, and Ms. Ryder has the courage to make her character a pain in the neck. But the small, introspective movie is nearly stolen by Ms. Jolie as a charismatic, brutally truth-telling sociopath who becomes Susanna's best friend (Holden).  ''THE GREEN MILE,'' starring Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse, Doug Hutchison, Sam Rockwell and Bonnie Hunt. Written and directed by Frank Darabont (R, 180 minutes). In adapting the death row drama that Stephen King wrote in multiple installments, the director of ''The Shawshank Redemption'' could have managed more economy and fewer talky bits of business around the cellblock. Still, this lengthy film is vivid and well played. Smooth ensemble acting builds up to the discovery that a gigantic condemned man (Mr. Duncan) is a prisoner with very special abilities, which gives the film its mixture of religious overtones and mild horror. Mr. Hanks, as a wry Southern prison guard, is so unaffectedly good that it's redundant to say so (Maslin).  ''HOLY SMOKE,'' starring Kate Winslet and Harvey Keitel. Directed by Jane Campion (R, 95 minutes). Having roamed so gorgeously through North Africa as a young hippie mother in ''Hideous Kinky,'' Ms. Winslet this time appears in India as Ruth Barron, a headstrong young Australian seeking enlightenment. Eventually Ruth's mother coaxes her home, where a ''cult exiter'' named P. J. (Mr. Keitel) is waiting to wean Ruth away from her Indian guru. But as the film moves from its early mix of rapture and humor into this more serious, confrontational stage, it runs into trouble. It doesn't help that Ms. Winslet's obvious strength and beauty leave Mr. Keitel's P. J. looking overmatched (Maslin).  * ''THE HURRICANE,'' starring Denzel Washington. Directed by Norman Jewison (R, 120 minutes). The life story of Hurricane Carter, a middleweight contender who spent nearly 20 years in prison for a triple murder he didn't commit, is a big, schmaltzy ballad of a movie redeemed by Mr. Washington's moving, bone-deep portrayal of the boxer from Paterson, N.J. But the movie plays fast and loose with the facts, giving far too much credit to the members of a Canadian commune who took up Mr. Carter's cause and all but eliminating his heroic co-defendant, John Artis, from the story. And the minor characters are either saints or monsters. Yet the story of a man heroically fighting his demons and winning his freedom is still inspiring (Holden).  ''ISN'T SHE GREAT,'' starring Bette Midler, Nathan Lane, Stockard Channing, David Hyde Pierce and John Cleese. Directed by Andrew Bergman (R, 90 minutes). In this bio-pic, Ms. Midler portrays the author Jacqueline Susann, who took the lurid pulp genre to a new, sweaty level. No one is more suited to playing a tease of a diva than Ms. Midler, who can wring more comedy out of operatic self-absorption than anyone else. And Mr. Lane, who plays Irving Mansfield, Susann's husband, promoter and biggest fan, is a spark plug: his voice shows up before he does. Yet in this adaptation of the material, Susann's life is flattened, made campy and cute. Sly hostility seems to be a facet of the screenwriter Paul Rudnick's talent. But Mr. Rudnick and Mr. Bergman have so defanged ''Isn't She Great'' that it's like watching a sketch from the old ''Carol Burnett Show'' that has mildewed (Elvis Mitchell).  ''THE LIFE AND TIMES OF HANK GREENBERG,'' directed by Aviva Kempner (not rated, 90 minutes). This unabashed valentine to baseball's Hall of Fame slugger demonstrates how little mankind and some of its sports figures have advanced since the 1930's and 40's and reminds us how the persistence of bigotry stains a nation founded on ideals like religious tolerance. The 30's and 40's were the heyday of Greenberg, a son of Jewish immigrants who came out of the Bronx to star with the Detroit Tigers, threaten Babe Ruth's home run record and become the first man to win most valuable player awards at two positions, first base and left field.

But his stardom, his innate decency, his work ethic and his World War II record made him a beacon of hope to many Jews. Taken as a whole, the documentary is faithful to its title, valuable as history and resonant with meaning for today (Lawrence Van Gelder).  ''MAGNOLIA,'' starring Tom Cruise, Melinda Dillon, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly and Jason Robards. Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (R, 180 minutes). In ''Magnolia'' the colossally talented Mr. Anderson has set up an artfully orchestrated symphony of intersecting L.A. stories, with many of the cast members from his ''Boogie Nights'' assembled to form a charismatic ensemble. The movie is saved from its own worst ideas by the intimacy of the performances. Its single biggest surprise is Tom Cruise in the role of a strutting, obscenity-spouting cult figure named Frank Mackey (Maslin).  ''PLAY IT TO THE BONE,'' starring Woody Harrelson, Antonio Banderas and Lolita Davidovich. Directed by Ron Shelton (R, 124 minutes). This screwball sports comedy stars Mr. Harrelson (with a shaved head) and Mr. Banderas as fading middleweight boxers and best friends summoned at the last minute to fight each other as the opening act for a Las Vegas heavyweight bout. The formulaic road movie follows them with their pal and mutual ex-girlfriend (Ms. Davidovich) on their wisecracking way from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, where they fight a brutal match. The dialogue has sass, and the filmmaker's jaundiced vision of the professional boxing world is very knowing, but the relationships don't track (Holden).  * ''THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY,'' starring Matt Damon, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Written and directed by Anthony Minghella (R, 135 minutes). There are diabolically smart surprises wherever you care to look in this glittering thriller. Proving that the brilliance of ''The English Patient'' was no fluke, Mr. Minghella shapes a hypnotic, sensually charged adaptation of Patricia High smith's fascinatingly reptilian murder story. The traffic-stopping cast includes Mr. Damon as the dangerous chameleon of the title and, in a star-making role, the English actor Jude Law as a rich dilettante who exerts a homoerotic magnetism. Ms. Paltrow plays the odd woman out with the shrewdness of a fine character actress, while Ms. Blanchett makes the delirious most of her role as a needy American post-debutante. As the story's odious playboy-snob, Mr. Hoffman is scene-stealingly wonderful. Gorgeously photographed in Italy by John Seale (Maslin).  * ''TITUS,'' starring Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Lange, Alan Cumming, Harry Lennix and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Directed by Julie Taymor (R, 160 minutes). Ms. Taymor, the theater director and puppeteer who created transfixing stage pictures in ''The Lion King'' and ''Juan Darien,'' has turned Shakespeare's goriest tragedy, ''Titus Andronicus,'' into a powerful contemplation of murderous revenge enacted throughout history. Mr. Hopkins is ghoulishly funny and tragic as the title character, whose political stupidity sets in motion a devastating chain reaction of killing, torture and retaliation. Ms. Lange is Tamora, the captured Goth empress who strikes back.

nyt_corpus_2000.har/07/02/1212062.xml	        Tygiel, a professor of history at San Francisco State University and the author of ''Baseball's Great Experiment: Jackie Robinson and His Legacy,'' places the sport in broad yet precise cultural contexts. He argues convincingly, for instance, that baseball became a national game because improvements in transportation and communication (railroads, the telegraph) unified the United States in the aftermath of the Civil War. Baseball became a symbol of that reunification. Tygiel also argues that the development of the social sciences and of statistics in the mid-19th century led Henry Chadwick to invent the box score and to establish methods to calculate and keep baseball records. Tygiel points out that Branch Rickey's creation of the farm system in the 1930's is coeval with the emergence of the first chain stores, which contributed to the creation of a national culture by making small towns feel they were part of a larger whole. While it is not particularly original to remark that Babe Ruth came onto the scene at the same time as radio broadcasting and the movies, Tygiel goes further by allowing that Ruth was also instrumental in the advance of public relations and advertising as businesses. He was among the first celebrities produced by those industries.
nyt_corpus_2000.har/07/02/1212084.xml	        In his tribute to Henry Aaron, Sandy Tolan delivers a solid hit. Tolan has decided to make an exploration of American racism as central to his memoir, ''Me and Hank,'' as his appreciation of the American pastime. Born and raised in Milwaukee, Tolan grew up watching Aaron lead a Braves team that won the World Series in 1957 but moved to Atlanta after the 1965 season. A loyal fan nonetheless, Tolan cheered Aaron on as, season by season, he closed in on baseball's most famous achievement: Babe Ruth's career total of 714 home runs. But the nearer Aaron came, the more hate mail he received -- menacing letters threatening to kill him should he, a black man, dare to supersede Ruth. Shocked and angered by such prejudice, the young Tolan wrote his hero a letter of support, and Aaron wrote back, thanking him for his concern. Twenty-five years later, Tolan remains perplexed that despite Aaron's formidable statistics, he is still underappreciated. Tolan, who is white, explores just how much race still matters in baseball and in the United States as he interviews, among others, Aaron and his wife and daughter; civil rights leaders, including Jesse Jackson and Andrew Young; old friends, black and white, with whom Tolan went to school; baseball players, coaches and executives like Bud Selig and Dusty Baker; and a black homeless man whom Tolan befriends. At times, Tolan can ramble too far afield, but his probing portrait reminds us that while thousands cheered, others fumed. And the cumulative impact of Tolan's documentary-like approach leaves no doubt of the true nature of Aaron's achievement, on the field and off.

Sullivan uses the history of Yankee Stadium to reflect the currents of change that have swept through New York in the past century, particularly in the Bronx. He is very good on the social and political background that led to the baseball boom of the 1920's. Yankee Stadium was not simply the House That Ruth Built; it resulted from the increasing wealth of the rising multiethnic fan base that attached itself to Babe Ruth. Sullivan, who teaches public affairs at Baruch College, is also good on sizing up the new stadium game as it is currently played by baseball owners around the country. ''The first point that can be held with near certainty,'' he writes, ''is that an economic investment in a stadium will not be returned''; ''wealth is not being created by the stadium so much as it is being diverted from one place to another.'' However, when it comes time to bring together the different strands of his ambitious book, Sullivan is tenuous and relies too much on secondhand material. And he repeats some of baseball's most cherished misinformation: Arnold Rothstein did not fix the 1919 World Series. ''The Diamond in the Bronx'' has many insights into the politics of the new stadium business and has some original observations about the rise of baseball in New York, but it reads like parts of two or even three books whose theses are not fully developed.

These biopics, of course, whether treating the exploits of Babe Ruth, Benny Goodman or Joan of Arc, were selling mythology, not biography.

The bat, one of the prize pieces of sports memorabilia, will go on sale for the first time in an Internet auction that begins Friday on eBay, with a minimum bid of $500,000.

For most of the last century, just the quest to fill his spikes was heroic romance enough for baseball. While most major sports are still based on regional competition and regional heroes -- almost incredible in this time of free agency -- Nascar has the opportunity of creating national heroes. But Nascar's founding family, the Frances, has always seemed fearful of promoting characters that might become bigger than the sport and thus have the power to get a better deal from management by threatening to create a rival league.

This was the beginning, many Bostonians are convinced, of the dread Curse of the Bambino, a spell of inferiority and World Series winlessness that has hung over their city ever since. If you acknowledge the Curse (and the Red Sox loss to the Yankees in the 2000 playoffs made confirmed believers of many who had only been slightly paranoid before), then to have your home team owned by The New York Times only confirms your sense that the universe is deeply and hurtfully unfair.

BROTHERHOOD (American Express/Sterling, $29.95) memorializes these improvisational offerings and gives a glimpse into the firefighters' lives after the tragedy. With more than 300 images by over 60 photographers, the collection includes a prologue by former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and a foreword by his fire commissioner, Thomas Von Essen. A lively introduction by Frank McCourt reflects on the civic connection we feel with firefighters, whether we see them shopping at the local deli or racing past on a fire truck. The book is organized into several thematic sections, like ''The Fallen,'' which shows snapshot displays of lost firefighters pasted up in firehouses, and ''Grief,'' a showcase of the shrines that sprouted on the city's sidewalks in their memory. In ''The Living,'' two adjacent black-and-white portraits of older firefighters, their faces stoic beneath leather helmets, convey a sense of quiet perseverance. The personalized spaces within the firehouses -- an old poster of Babe Ruth, a musty library of fire records more than a century old -- resonate as powerfully as the portraits of the firefighters themselves. But it's the book's least prominent feature that is also its most stirring: from cover to cover, in tiny, fine silver lettering, the names of the fallen form an unbroken chain across the bottom of each page.

Barry Bonds places 16th -- and this without the benefit of his record-breaking 2001 season. (''When people begin to take in all of his accomplishments, Bonds may well be rated among the five greatest players in the history of the game,'' James writes.)

nyt_corpus_2002.har/03/31/1379974.xml	        The slow, wrenching, devastating demise of Gehrig is illuminated in Richard J. Tofel's excellent book about the 1939 Yankees, ''A Legend in the Making.'' The 1927 Yankees are generally regarded as one of baseball's greatest teams, with a Murderers' Row lineup that included Babe Ruth and a young Gehrig. And often the Yankees of 1961, the Oakland Athletics of 1972-74, the Cincinnati Reds of 1975-76 and the Yankees of 1998 are compared with the '27 team. But the '39 Yankees may have been better than any of them, finishing the season with a record of 106-45; Connie Mack, the legendary manager of the Philadelphia Athletics, concluded at the time that the '39 Yankees were history's greatest team. As Tofel notes, that group of Yankees essentially established the franchise as a dynasty, becoming the first team to win three consecutive championships, before winning a fourth straight title in 1939.

nyt_corpus_2002.har/04/07/1382196.xml	        The fact, according to records of the ''heritage,'' is that when the Curtiss Candy Company of Chicago introduced the candy bar, in 1921, it denied having named the nutty confection bar for Babe Ruth. After the candy company began a ''strong promotion,'' as recalled in ''The Life That Ruth Built,'' by Marshall Smelser (Times Books, 1975), Ruth challenged it. ''Ruth's protests were rebuffed,'' Smelser wrote, and ''he countered by founding the George H. Ruth Candy Company.'' Ruth tried to register the phrase ''Babe Ruth Home Run Bar'' for his candy. But the Curtiss company opposed it, and the patent office turned down the Babe's application.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/04/07/1382196.xml	        So, as the manufacturers of the candy bar then would have had people believe, there was no more association with Babe Ruth than he had with Hershey's Kisses, or Tootsie Roll. They'd have you believe the premise that such an association with the Babe was worth nothing more than a Snicker. You'd have to be from Mars to swallow that one.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/04/07/1382196.xml	        The Curtiss company's official position on the name Baby Ruth was this: The candy bar first appeared in 1921, and this was ''some years before Babe Ruth, the ballplayer, became famous.

nyt_corpus_2002.har/04/07/1382196.xml	        The history books belie this. Babe Ruth was already one of the most famous people in America by 1921. The year before the Baby Ruth candy bar began getting stuck in people's bicuspids, Ruth set the sports world on its ear with his record-shattering 54 home runs, in 1920. The year before that, in 1919, he hit a then-amazing and record-shattering 29 home runs. By 1921, the reference book ''Urban Legends'' states, Ruth's name ''was featured more prominently on the front pages of afternoon newspapers in America than President Harding.''

He devotes plenty of space to the Yankees before they were winners -- they didn't hit pay dirt until 1921, their 19th season. As late as 1920, The Sporting News referred to the Yankees' ''Old Jinx,'' as the franchise seemed to be perpetually afflicted with debilitating injuries and various other forms of bad luck. That ended, of course, soon after the acquisition of Babe Ruth in 1920, though Stout refutes the oft-told story about the Boston Red Sox owner Harry Frazee selling the Bambino in order to finance a Broadway production of ''No, No, Nanette.'' Not to be confused with ''Yankees Century'' is A YANKEE CENTURY (Berkley, $26.95), a haphazard primer by Harvey Frommer on the franchise's history. THE NEW YORK YANKEES ILLUSTRATED HISTORY (St. Martin's, $29.95), on the other hand, is like a lovingly constructed family photo album, the margins filled with stories told by a few of your more interesting uncles, in this case The New York Times's sportswriters Dave Anderson, Murray Chass, Robert Lipsyte, Buster Olney and George Vecsey. Here are the familiar images -- Ruth watching his 60th homer sail over the fence; Lou Gehrig watching infield practice before the first game in nearly 15 years in which he didn't play; Casey Stengel gazing into his crystal baseball; Billy Martin and Reggie Jackson nearly coming to blows -- but there are others, both less familiar and more revealing. Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle are depicted in 1951 (DiMaggio's last season and Mantle's first). DiMaggio's smile appears forced, and he looks at neither the camera nor his understudy. As Lipsyte writes, ''Despite the hype or maybe because of it, the great DiMaggio never gave Mantle the time of day.''

In many ways, Bonds's other stats -- notably his 198 walks, by far the record for a single season -- combine to elevate him beyond the stratosphere he reached last year, when he walloped a record 73 home runs. Could Bonds in 2002 have been better than Babe Ruth in his prime? The verdicts are rolling in.

Morris has developed a probabilistic model of how doubles, outs, hit-by-pitches and the like actually interact to create runs. Discussing his findings last month before the American Statistical Association, he determined that a lineup of nine players with Bonds's 2002 numbers would score 22.5 runs per game, considerably more than the runner-up, a team of Babe Ruths in 1923 (19.6).

Thus at one recent gathering the topics discussed included how The New York Herald Tribune helped expose the racism on the 1947 St. Louis Cardinals, how much Babe Ruth's bat weighed, and how, while everyone remembers Bill Mazeroski's famous home run that day, few realize that no one struck out in the seventh game of the 1960 World Series. On a loftier level, they pondered the classic conundrum of the true New York baseball fan: What would you do if you had Hitler, Stalin and Walter O'Malley (for the uninitiated, the man who moved the Brooklyn Dodgers to Los Angeles) standing before you, and had only two bullets in your gun? Actually, it's not all that difficult. You save them both for O'Malley.

Even so, for 20 years he split all royalties with them and their survivors; each ended up with about $10,000, no small sum for people without pensions. For Snodgrass, who played center field in the Polo Grounds, Mr. Ritter dug up and sent off some turf shortly before the place was demolished.

Nobody's had better years when you combine all the numbers.'' He should compare Babe Ruth's 1920 and 1921 versus Bonds's 2001 and 2002: Bonds had 119 home runs versus 113 for the Babe, beating Ruth by 6 in longer seasons. But in their two best seasons Ruth had 308 runs batted in versus 247 for Bonds, and Ruth scored 335 runs to Bonds's 246. Bonds hit .328 and .370, but Ruth betters him with .376 and .378.

The Tigers won the pennant but lost the World Series.) And like David himself, he volunteered to fight for his country, enlisting in midcareer after Pearl Harbor in the Army Air Corps.

In 2001, the 37-year-old Barry Bonds was no longer competing with the young Barry Bonds: he was competing with the young Babe Ruth. That year, Bonds set a major league record for home runs (73) and slugging percentage (.863). From 35 through 37, when most players are contemplating retirement, he more than doubled his home run total.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/03/31/1476989.xml	        Some baseball analysts like to add on-base and slugging percentages as a quick measure of all-around batting effectiveness. George Ignatin, a professor of economics and a sports statistician at the University of Alabama-Birmingham, argues that multiplying on-base and slugging gives a more accurate assessment of a hitter's run-producing potential. Ignatin refers to the statistic as SLOB. Bonds's 2002 SLOB of .465 means that Bonds created 46.5 runs per 100 at-bats, topping even his 2001 mark of .444. Let's put that in perspective: in 1921, Babe Ruth posted a .433 SLOB, the highest of his career.

The paradox of being a baseball fan is that love of the game is rooted in the past but also brand-new every season, every game, every inning.

But will his collection appeal to those who are not baseball buffs? I think it will, partly because he is such affable company, but mainly because felicitous prose is its own reward. With his novelist's eye, Angell -- for many years the chief fiction editor at The New Yorker -- describes Casey Stengel as ''a walking pantheon of evocations,'' observes Yogi Berra's ''gentle, seamed smile, like a Gladstone bag opening,'' and comments on Babe Ruth's ''debutante ankles.'' A crafty pitcher has batters ''swaying at the plate like cobras to a flageolet,'' and a bunt meanders up the foul line ''like a 6-year-old bicyclist's first solo: fair, fair, foul -- oop, fair -- foul, then miraculously fair again.'' The only mot that strikes me as not quite juste has Barry Bonds standing in the middle of the Giants' batting order ''like an aneurysm.'' Say what? But Angell redeems himself with a parade of persuasive images -- for example, ''Omar Vizquel, the Indians shortstop, complained to an ump about the distracting earrings sported by Seattle reliever Arthur Rhodes, and won an on-the-spot disjewelment.''
nyt_corpus_2003.har/05/25/1491477.xml	        Experts in hexology agree that the Curse of the Bambino -- unlike, say, the Sports Illustrated jinx -- is the real deal. It will probably wind up lasting an entire century, so for the next 15 years Boston fans will have to make do with ''The Little Red (Sox) Book,'' by everyone's favorite pothead pitcher, Bill Lee. According to his co-author, Jim Prime, who once wrote a book with Ted Williams, the Spaceman's drug of choice these days is Advil, but you wouldn't know it from reading this alternate-universe history of the Red Sox. In Lee's hallucinations, Babe Ruth never leaves Boston, and the Red Sox go on to acquire dozens of world championships (the evil empire in the Bronx wins none); Jackie Robinson and Willie Mays both play for the Red Sox, turning Boston into ''an oasis of racial tolerance'' (now that's a fantasy); Bill (''the ball missed my glove'') Buckner takes himself out of the game before Mookie Wilson bats; and Roger Clemens doesn't have to go to New York to get his ring, ''like some 54th Street hooker.'' You don't have to love the Red Sox to enjoy this book, but it helps if you hate the Yankees. Like an old stoner friend, Lee is sometimes witty, sometimes boring and always goofy. ''Part baseball Bolshevik and part armchair anarchist,'' he offers opinions on a variety of players, managers and coaches, including Pete Rose (''that annoying automaton'') and Don Zimmer (''dumb as a post''). Oddly, a very popular obscenity -- at Fenway it is often used in conjunction with ''Bucky'' and ''Dent'' -- has here been replaced by asterisks. Maybe that bit of old-fashioned puritanism is a New Englander's way of pretending it's still 1918, or maybe this particular curse is the only one that Red Sox Nation can do anything about.

And no World Series titles in 85 years. Now, a new indignity: as the narrator of its tragic-comic documentary ''The Curse of the Bambino,'' HBO chose Ben Affleck, co-star of ''Gigli,'' a movie with worse reviews than Bob Stanley's in the 1986 World Series.

In baseball, some players have been lucky enough to top the records of unpopular figures, as Pete Rose was when he cracked the mark for career hits held by Ty Cobb, a man with a temperament so foul he was despised by many of his own teammates. Others, like Hank Aaron when he out-homered a hugely popular player, Babe Ruth, are greeted with hate mail and even death threats.

He went 2 for 4, and his grand slam off KELLY WUNSCH was his 40th homer of the season. Giambi joined Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Mickey Mantle as the only Yankees with multiple 40-homer seasons. ''It's exciting, especially with how hard it's been this year,'' Giambi said. ''I was sitting on 35 in the middle of last month, and to grind it out and get it out of the way, that's exciting when you start putting your name next to guys like that.''

It was a thrill, Giambi said, to be linked in history with Yankee legends. But Giambi has always felt his closest kinship with Mark McGwire, the slugger who preceded him as the Oakland Athletics' first baseman.

With all due respect to our New York readership -- Yankee fans among them -- to George Steinbrenner and to the Yankees themselves, we find it hard to resist the emotional tug and symmetrical possibilities of a series between teams that seem to have been put on earth to tantalize and then crush their zealous fans. Together they account for 180 years of futility. The Cubs have not won a World Series since 1908. The Red Sox have not won one since 1918, a little more than a year before they shipped Babe Ruth to the Yankees, a famously bizarre transaction that ushered in the era of Yankee domination.

He works in suburban Indianapolis, to be precise, in the glass-and-concrete headquarters of CMG Worldwide, which represents the publicity interests of deceased icons like James Dean; Marilyn Monroe; Babe Ruth; Jackie Robinson; Diana, Princess of Wales; and, yes, Bogart. It was Mark Roesler who picked up the phone and pitched Thomasville the idea of using Bogie to sell a sleigh bed, resulting in the collection that is now the company's biggest seller, with a ''significant impact'' on its bottom line, according to a spokesman. (Roesler was inspired by the Ernest Hemingway Collection by Thomasville.)
nyt_corpus_2003.har/10/12/1526423.xml	        In person, Roesler seems an unlikely character to be steeped in old Hollywood glamour, or even new Hollywood flash. Built like an N.B.A. shooting guard with an accent that is pure Hoosier, he doesn't seem to care much about movie stars or ''the business,'' except insofar as it means a new marketing opportunity. Despite dealing with movie studios, politicians and advertising sharpies for more than 20 years, he has taken on few of their slick ways, save for the green Bentley he drives on Indiana's near-empty highways. Divorced, with three children, he wears suits that have seen better days and includes the fact that he was valedictorian of his high school class in his promotional materials. Most days he eats lunch -- a Wendy's salad -- at his desk, beneath a 5-by-4-foot plaster bas-relief of Marilyn's face (yours for $25,000). There is memorabilia on nearly every surface of the custom-designed building, but not a touch of irony. In a small ''museum,'' Bette Davis's suits from ''Now, Voyager'' and Babe Ruth's jerseys are displayed behind glass. Local schools bring children there on field trips.

Born in Fall River, Mass., Gonsalves, 6 feet 2 inches and 210 pounds, won the Cup with Fall River teams in 1930 and 1931 and New Bedford in 1932. He was then sold to the St. Louis club Stix, Baer & Fuller (sponsored by a department store), winning there in 1933 and '34. He won again in 1935 with St. Louis Central. Gonsalves played on the United States World Cup teams in 1930 (the inaugural tournament in Uruguay, where the United States lost in the semifinals) and 1934, and he ended his career with Brooklyn Hispano, winning Open Cup titles in 1943 and '44.

During that time the team has carried with it the burden of an alleged curse -- caused, some say, by the sale of Babe Ruth to the Yankees. Nomar Garciaparra, the Red Sox shortstop, spoke to reporters about the curse. ''I was talking with Jason Varitek after the game,'' he said. ''We both just read the new biography of Sylvia Plath and I was saying that, in many ways, our experience as a ball club is much like Ms. Plath's -- passionate, yes. Creative, yes.

There was only one out, and the other team put runners on first and third, but, from my comfortable seat on the bench, it was hard to get too worked up about it. The first rule of New Orleans life was that whatever game he happened to be playing, Sean Tuohy won it. Then Fitz made his second trip of the inning to the pitcher's mound, and all hell broke loose in the stands. Their fans started hollering at the umps: it was illegal to visit the mound twice in one inning and leave your pitcher in. The umpires, wary as ever of being caught listening to fans, were clearly inclined to overlook the whole matter. But before they could, a well-known New Orleans high-school baseball coach who carried a rule book on his person came out from the stands onto the field and stopped the game.

His thesis is that each comes from a unique era in the evolution of American society: the agrarian era (baseball), the industrial (football), the postindustrial (basketball). The form of baseball was set in the late 19th century before most Americans succumbed to the tyranny of the clock. Once the rules of baseball were set, they were seldom changed. Tradition was everything, the present always measured against the past. Statistics became essential to that tradition. Around 1920, Babe Ruth changed the leisurely spirit of the game, establishing the home run as its most dramatic accomplishment. But the game itself seldom changed.

nyt_corpus_2004.har/07/11/1595666.xml	        Arguing that ''fat is a man's issue,'' Sander L. Gilman examines depictions of the ''fat boy'' in Western culture from Greek medical texts to 20th-century literature and from opera to popular entertainment. Gilman, who teaches medicine and liberal arts and sciences at the University of Illinois, Chicago, discusses disparate figures like Socrates, Santa Claus, Falstaff and Babe Ruth. ''The study of obesity in its cultural and social contexts provides a wide range of interlocking questions about the cultural construction of the body,'' he writes. By examining these representations and experiences, Gilman examines the ways that ideas of masculinity, morality, sexuality, rationality and ethnicity have been inscribed onto the body of the obese man. Following one rich thread, he links Greek medicine to Renaissance ideas about melancholy, age, syphilis and obesity, then to 19th-century anxieties about sexual dysfunction. He finds that the obese man signifies a moral and medical failure; yet, in the guise of the fat detective (like Nero Wolfe), he also becomes ''the modern body, with fat masking the internal processes of civilization.'' Gilman opens a valuable conversation about the cultural history of obesity that examines how we have come to understand -- and misunderstand -- the condition.
nyt_corpus_2004.har/07/11/1595667.xml	        In 1919 Lewis Lawes was appointed warden at Sing Sing, an institution that had previously eaten up administrators at an alarming rate. Housing more than 1,000 of the toughest prisoners in New York, Sing Sing seemed a throwback to the Dark Ages. Cells were cramped, damp and dismal; prisoners had little to do to keep them occupied, and rehabilitation seemed to be a word confined to the dictionary. Lawes, according to Ralph Blumenthal's informative and entertaining ''Miracle at Sing Sing,'' treated the inmates like human beings, capable of redemption. Before his reign, ''prisons had too long been viewed as giant holding pens for criminal animals. Now his Psychiatric Department of seven . . . would evaluate each man individually and decide on a course of mental and social rehabilitation.'' Lawes worked other wonders, like persuading the notorious, universally despised Charles Chapin, the former editor of The New York Evening World who was sentenced to life imprisonment for murdering his wife, to start a prison newspaper. He also established prison baseball and football teams, and recruited stars like Babe Ruth to play exhibition games against the prisoners within the confines of the yard. While chronicling Lawes's life, Blumenthal, the author of ''Stork Club'' and now Houston bureau chief of The New York Times, also offers fascinating tidbits about the prison (its name was derived from Sint Sinck, ''meaning stone upon stone'' in a local Indian language). He gives sketches of some of the more notorious inmates, like George C. Parker, ''who had sold the new Brooklyn Bridge to a gullible visitor from the West for $50,000'' and Willie Sutton, who treated banks as his personal ATM. During his tenure at Sing Sing, Lawes became a household name, gracing the cover of Time magazine and writing several books, including ''20,000 Years in Sing Sing,'' which, along with several of his other works was turned into a movie. In his case, at least, crime did, in fact, pay.

And if you're a sportswriter they mean you can crank out yet more column inches on the storied rivalry between these two teams -- a competition that has variously been compared to the ancient struggles between Athens and Sparta, to the Renaissance rivalry between Florence and Venice and to a non-nuclear cold war.

(Halas, who could not hit the curve, was succeeded in right by Babe Ruth, who could.) A better-than-average football player, an innovative owner, a superb general manager and an even more brilliant coach, Halas was a fiercely proud man who probably felt that his stature as father of both the league and the Bears was insufficiently appreciated as the years rolled along. This was partly because he was nasty, vindictive, cruel, cheap and widely suspected of having the refs in his pocket.

Skeptics of the time noted that the right-field fence at Chicago's Lake Front Park stood just 230 to 270 feet from home plate. When Babe Ruth was passing Williamson's mark in 1919, several writers contended that the record rightfully belonged to Buck Freeman, who hit 25 for the 1899 Washington Senators.

If he wasn't racing drunk, sometimes decked in a silk suit, then he was racing with a splitting hangover. He was fond of passing a mint julep-filled jug back and forth to other drivers, through the racecar window, while he was racing. The first thing he did, when dragging himself out of his car in the victory lane, was light up a Camel. He invited reporters to Led Zeppelin-worthy parties -- pre-race and post-race -- where a bevy of waitresses or a police car might end up in a motel pool, or, if the affair was held in Turner's self-designed ''party room,'' he might demonstrate how a fluorescent light could magically remove the few strips of clothing on the decorative images of beauty queens on the walls. ''You see a person, when they open the bottle, they throw the cap away?

Since then, the Yankees have won 26 World Series and 39 American League pennants, while the Red Sox, believed in some circles to be toiling under the ''curse of the Bambino,'' won no more World Series until last year. The contract, offered for sale by Alan Shaw Feinstein, a Rhode Island philanthropist, is dated Dec. 26, 1919, and is between Harry Frazee, the Red Sox owner, and Jacob Ruppert, owner of the Yankees. It is expected to sell for more than $500,000. The sale includes 350 lots of Boston sports memorabilia, among them the first baseball pitched in Fenway Park, at its grand opening, on April 20, 1912. Before the auction, the items from baseball, basketball, football, boxing, tennis, and track and field will be on view at Sotheby's New York from June 5 to 9.

What he uncovers in ''Luckiest Man'' is a personality much more shaded than Cooper's uncomplicated all-American boy. Gehrig's was a rags-to-riches story; the same, almost uncannily repeated tale of so many Yankee greats: Joe DiMaggio, son of a humble Italian fisherman; Mickey Mantle, from a family of Oklahoma miners; Babe Ruth, Gehrig's Rabelaisian teammate, brought up in a Baltimore orphanage. Unlike the others, Henry Louis Gehrig didn't have to come to the big city to make good. +He was born here, the son of struggling German immigrants. His father was a sometime ironworker who maintained a lifelong preference for beer over industry. His mother was an imposing woman who would exercise an overweening influence on her only surviving child well into his adult life.

He would not miss a day for nearly 14 seasons, his famous record of 2,130 consecutive games bested by Cal Ripken Jr. only in 1995. Once again, hard work and persistence were the keys. He played through bouts of lumbago, broken fingers, bone chips and a beaning that left his head so swollen he had to wear Babe Ruth's cap. As happened with Ripken, some of the bright boys in the press box would periodically suggest that Gehrig was hurting himself and his team by not taking a day off, but his record was difficult to argue with. Gehrig scored more than 100 runs, drove in more than 100 more and batted .300 or better in 12 consecutive seasons. Out of the 34 World Series games he played, he drove in the winning run a remarkable eight times. Before he was struck down, he was on a pace to claim most of the game's batting records.

Babe Ruth's contract, which sent him from the Red Sox to the Yankees in 1919, went for nearly $1 million. A 1913 Liberty Head nickel went for $4.15 million, up from $3 million a year earlier.

And it is true that Babe Ruth was traded to the Yankees for $100,000 -- which translates to $1.2 million in today's dollars -- making the $1 million price tag his contract just fetched sound like a bargain.

He graduated magna cum laude from CCNY in 1941 with a degree in accounting. He was with Apfel & Englander from 1941-1969, becoming a senior partner; with Seidman & Seidman from 1970-1986, where he was national director of tax practice; and he served as a senior consultant with BDO Seidman from 1987 to his death. An expert in estate planning, he served as president of the New York State Society of CPAs from 1976-7 and chaired several AICPA task forces on estate taxation, was a frequent speaker and writer on tax law and estate planning, and was a champion of estate tax reforms. He was born October 14, 1920, in New York City, minutes ahead of his twin Stanley. As a youth he sold concessions at Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds (on those days when a Mr. Goldstein chose the vendors; on other days the Irish kids got the nod); Bernard was sad to report that many of those Babe Ruth signatures from the Babe's 1938 return to the Polo Grounds as a Brooklyn Dodger coach were actually signed by fellow Dodger coaches Jesse Haines and Andy High. Among his early clients as a CPA were several artists and writers who worked at The New Yorker; without betraying confidences, we can report that A.J. Liebling's remuneration did not keep pace with his gustatory appetites. Bernard twice served in the armed forces. In his first stint, from 1942-1946, he served as a finance officer with the Army, stationed most memorably in England; he rose to the rank of Captain. He served from 1951-1952 as a Major in the Air Force, based in New York City, where he audited military contracts. He was a lifelong traveler; he and his wife visited every continent (including Antarctica); thanks to his accounting nature we know that they took thirty-five cruises on twenty-three different ships (including a dugout canoe) between 1963 and 2000. He beat polio as a teenager and was a three-time cancer survivor, a testament to his determination. He was predeceased by his son, Douglas, in 1960, and his twin, Stanley, in 2004. His survivors--his wife of 53 years, Helen, of Sleepy Hollow; his daughter, Susan, of Roscoe, New York; his brother, Joseph, of Culver City, California, and nieces and nephews all over--will miss his humor and elan. There will be a memorial service in New York City at a later date.

The Zane Grey who emerges here is self-absorbed and adolescently melodramatic, oblivious to money and incapable of business (even though, by 1929, he was earning four times the salary of Babe Ruth). He was petty and brittle in his friendships, loving though largely absent as a father, prescient and passionate in his environmentalism, supremely competent and knowledgeable as a fisherman (he held several world angling records) but, most of all, outlandishly deluded about himself and the world he inhabited. ''The man has always lived in a land of make-believe,'' Dolly once wrote, and while that's applicable to every fiction writer before and since, Grey struggled more than most to reconcile fantasy with reality. ''The spirit, not the letter, of life'' was what interested Grey, and his fabulist vision of the West, now firmly implanted in the national psyche, reflected that.

But by all accounts the level of play in youth baseball, as well as the degree of competitiveness and the investment of time and money required of parents, has escalated dramatically in the past 10 years or so -- primarily owing to the rising popularity of tournament-oriented travel teams. Today, there are an estimated 30,000 teams playing travel ball, which is entirely separate from more long-standing youth organizations like Little League and Babe Ruth. The greatest concentration of travel-ball teams appears to be in sun-drenched states like Florida, Texas and California, places rich with retired professional players who coach or offer private lessons, and where the weather allows for year-round play.

nyt_corpus_2006.har/06/04/1766401.xml	        IN baseball's modern era -- that is, A.D., or After Durocher -- many key roles have been updated for expedience. Most pitchers are now thankful to last six innings, a third of all players platoon and those past their prime (or just defensively challenged) are downgraded to the humble status of designated hitter. No wonder the Babe Ruth epic continues to fascinate.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/06/04/1766401.xml	        His talent, coupled with a blustery persona and Bunyanesque physique, was the spark that lighted baseball's populist fuse and set it off into prime-time glory. Before Ruth's debut with the Red Sox in 1914, the sport was dominated by a collection of gnarly, tobacco-spittin' cusses who were moved around on the diamond like chess pieces, and had about as much charisma. Babe Ruth was the game's first outsize personality, its first superstar; he courted the fans and press with his on- and off-the-field antics that rivaled those of any celebrity. There were serial car crashes, assorted lovers and paternities, spectacular fights, to say nothing of a vaudeville act in the off-season worthy of Pia Zadora.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/06/04/1766401.xml	        If Baltimore nurtured him, Boston provided him with a proper upbringing. Ruth's production at Fenway was so extraordinary, to the point of being almost superhuman, that opposing pitchers were known to throw their gloves in disgust into the outfield. On May 7, 1918, we are told in Leigh Montville's new biography, ''The Big Bam,'' Ruth, playing against Washington, faced Walter Johnson, who was baseball's pre-eminent pitcher, and ''whacked a shot over the right-field fence that landed in someone's victory garden and scared a dog.'' Two days later, while pitching for the Sox, Ruth went 5-for-5 with a triple, three doubles and a single. Just another routine day. By then, according to Montville, Ruth was ''the No. 1 attraction in the game. . . . He was the best player on the best team, and if you listened, you would hear good young players compared now to Babe Ruth, not Ty Cobb, not anyone else.''
nyt_corpus_2006.har/06/04/1766401.xml	        Of course, Babe Ruth and New York were made for each other. The city's 18 newspapers covered him like a character in a lurid soap opera and indeed, his escapades became bigger, flashier, noisier under the news media glare. Appropriate nicknames were coined to exploit his new currency, among them Bambino, the Big Bam, the Sultan of Swat and, courtesy of The Times, the Caliph of Crash. New York even built a new arena to showcase Ruth's prowess, and when Yankee Stadium opened on April 18, 1923 -- against the sorry Red Sox, of all teams -- he christened it with a rocket shot over the right-field bleachers, prompting yet another nickname, the House That Ruth Built, which has stuck to this day.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/06/04/1766401.xml	        Ruth's seasons in New York were his wonder years. His sidekicks, the famed Murderers' Row (Lou Gehrig, Tony Lazzeri et al.), provided the kind of supporting cast that allowed the Babe Ruth story to reach legendary heights. The city was a world stage for Ruth, and he knew exactly what to do when the spotlight was on him. Montville devotes the second half of his book to those stellar Yankees years, when perhaps the greatest baseball in history was being played. A former writer for Sports Illustrated and the author of a biography of Ted Williams, Montville colors the team's remarkable feats -- and foibles -- with gripping detail.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/06/04/1766401.xml	        What's missing here, however, is any exploration of Ruth's inner conflicts and demons. Time and again, Montville sidesteps critical issues with a device he calls ''the fog.'' Often, when some aspect of the Babe Ruth legend falls outside his research, the fog rolls in. This is especially frustrating with respect to Ruth's family history, as well as his mounting medical problems. His first wife, Helen Woodford, also remains shrouded in myth.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/06/04/1766401.xml	        Yet even today, as Ruth's incredible home run total is about to be broken once again, we are reminded of the days when real heroes trod the base paths, heroes who played hard, lived hard and gave us everything they had on and off the field -- the days when ''60 was the new number on the wall,'' as Montville writes, ''the record of records.'' The names of the players who eventually broke that record have come and gone, so much of their achievement still open to debate. Babe Ruth remains the gold standard. ''No man has ever lived who hit a baseball as hard as Ruth,'' Damon Runyon wrote in 1920. For all we know, that still holds true.

nyt_corpus_2006.har/06/04/1766404.xml	        BASEBALL BETWEEN THE NUMBERS: Why Everything You Know About the Game Is Wrong. By the experts at Baseball Prospectus. Edited by Jonah Keri. (Basic Books, $24.95.) It's ''Freakonomics'' for statheads. Which is better, a four- or five-man pitching rotation? Babe Ruth or Barry Bonds? Are stolen bases overrated? This smart, idiosyncratic collection of essays, by the staff of the Web site Baseball Prospectus, challenges traditional approaches to evaluating strategies and players. Using statistical methods now known collectively as sabermetrics, contributors explore why City X shouldn't have built that new ballpark, whether baseball needs a salary cap and why common statistical terms (r.b.i., earned runs) distort a player's true value. Many of the book's debates will be familiar to fans who have read Bill James's ''Baseball Abstract'' or ''Moneyball,'' Michael Lewis's best seller about the Oakland A's. Like Lewis, the Baseball Prospectus team can make just about anything interesting, even as their investigations occasionally fall short of resolving debates beyond a reasonable doubt. (Is David Ortiz of the Red Sox a clutch hitter? That depends, they say, on your definition of ''clutch.'') The book's least satisfying chapter, on the impact of steroids, is unable to parse the statistics and separate natural power from steroid power; the authors reserve judgment on players like Bonds and Mark McGwire: ''In the Juiced Era, we have the right to be skeptical, but it would be a shame if we've become so cynical that we can no longer enjoy these achievements.'' Prodigiously informative, sometimes dense, ''Baseball Between the Numbers'' is an excellent companion for the long summer ahead.

nyt_corpus_2006.har/06/25/1771438.xml	        Bob Spitz, in his review of ''The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth,'' by Leigh Montville (June 4), gushes: ''No baseball player, despite what record books claim, has ever equaled Ruth's awesome performance.'' If anything, Ruth's records deserve their own asterisk because the greatest black ballplayers of his time were banned from the major leagues.Babe Ruth never had to hit against Satchel Paige or pitch to Josh Gibson (who hit nearly 800 home runs while playing much of his Negro League career in the most cavernous ballparks of that era, Forbes Field and Griffith Stadium). In my view, any major league record set before 1950 should be marked by an asterisk. Spitz also refers to the vagueness surrounding Ruth's family history. Throughout his life Ruth was dogged by rumors of black ancestry, which he neither confirmed nor denied. Indeed, Ty Cobb, an outspoken and notorious racist, openly disparaged Ruth with racial epithets reserved for blacks. The truth of this matter will probably never be known, but the sports journalist Red Smith once remarked that ''Jackie Robinson was not the first black man to play in the major leagues. He was merely the first identifiable one.''

The large courtyard pool Wright insisted upon permitted the Imperial's alert staff to douse numerous small blazes created by the earthquake and to save it. The hotel went on to survive World War II as well. Its reputed indestructibility added to its mystique, attracting celebrities like Babe Ruth and the honeymooning Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio. In the late 1960's, old age led to the dismantling of the hotel, whose facade can now be viewed in a theme park devoted to the Meiji era.

Connor had hit 138 home runs in the 1880s and 1890s, and Ruth passed him in 1921 with little or no fanfare. Much was made of Henry Aaron eclipsing Ruth's record in 1974, but even then probably the most notable thing that happened was that Aaron shoved a box of strawberries in a reporter's face.

She seems more interested in McPherson as an early example of someone who lost control of her own fame. The historian Stephen Prothero sums it up nicely. ''Nowadays celebrities do have some sense of what they're getting in for,'' he says. ''In the '20s that wasn't necessarily the case.
