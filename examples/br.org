- 1987/05/23/0043074	        What would Eddie Shore, known as the *Babe Ruth of* hockey, have said about this? Shore, who played from 1926 through 1940, incurred fractures to his hip, collarbone and back, had a jaw that was broken five times, a nose broken 14 times, an ear that was virtually chewed off, and was a guy who witnessed all of his teeth being knocked out, and who needed 978 stitches in order to get through his 14-year career.
- 1988/03/07/0125336	        LEAD:  QUESTION: An obituary last month of Bob O'Farrell, the former St. Louis Cardinal catcher, reported that he ended the 1926 World Series by throwing out *Babe Ruth of* the Yankees attempting to steal second base. What were the circumstances of such a bizarre Series-ending play? How many stolen bases did
- 1988/03/07/0125336	        QUESTION: An obituary last month of Bob O'Farrell, the former St. Louis Cardinal catcher, reported that he ended the 1926 World Series by throwing out *Babe Ruth of* the Yankees attempting to steal second base. What were the circumstances of such a bizarre Series-ending play? How many stolen bases did Ruth have in his career?
- 1988/11/04/0194523	        And some of the players might even show a smooth cheek. That would also lessen the nostalgia of the sport, and its record-keeping. After all, who could ever again even challenge the 978 stitches (his count) earned by Eddie Shore, the *Babe Ruth of* hockey, during his 14-year N.H.L. career?
- 1990/09/30/0387484	        Only 10 major leaguers have hit 50 or more home runs, although several did it more than once and *Babe Ruth of* the Yankees did it four times. The last player to do it was George Foster, who hit 52 with Cincinnati in 1977. The last American Leaguer to hit 50 was Roger Maris of the Yankees, who set the major league record (61) in 1961. The Detroit record (58) was set by Hank Greenberg in 1938; Fielder's 49 is second in Tiger history.
- 1990/10/28/0396229	        "Managing the Non-Profit Organization" is sensible, suggestive and stirring -- a rare blend. At 80 years of age, Peter Drucker remains the *Babe Ruth of* management writers, still hitting home runs.
- 1991/08/11/0466280	        Mr. Eisenstaedt was a staff photographer when Life published its first issue on Nov. 23, 1936. His candid style took readers into private moments of his subjects' lives. Soon, Americans could immediately recognize an Eisenstaedt picture, and several generations of photographers, amateurs and professionals alike, tried to emulate their hero, the *Babe Ruth of* 35-millimeter photography.
- 1991/12/02/0491092	        "He's awesome," said Clint Bolick, vice president of the Institute for Justice, a conservative public-interest law firm, and a constant antagonist of Mr. Neas. "I wish he weren't so, and my career is dedicated to making him less effective. But, I've got to admire him. He's the *Babe Ruth of* civil rights lobbyists."
- 1992/06/01/0533054	        Half a century ago, Buck Leonard was the Homestead Grays' first baseman. In those years he and the Grays' catcher, the late Josh Gibson, were considered the Lou Gehrig and the *Babe Ruth of* the team that won nine consecutive pennants in what are still called the Negro Leagues.
- 1993/03/19/0596753	        Fiorello LaGuardia liked to say that when he made a mistake, it was "a beaut," and for Ms. Kiss this is doubly true. In New York legal lore, Mr. Solerwitz is the *Babe Ruth of* ripoffs, having been convicted of stealing more than $5 million in the 1980's. He is serving 5 to 15 years in prison for grand larceny.
- 1993/07/07/0620076	        In the wake of his conviction, Cepeda became an outcast on the island that hailed him as a hero. Upon reflection, Cepeda realized that he had not only injured himself but had brought shame to one of the island's royal baseball families. His father was alternately called the Bull and the *Babe Ruth of* the Caribbean. Cepeda was known as the Baby Bull.
- 1994/03/11/0673751	        "I'm delighted that John Daly is coming back into the fold," he said. "It reminds me of when the Yankees played in the 20's and 30's, and if Babe Ruth wasn't in the lineup, there was hardly anybody in the crowd. Now comes the *Babe Ruth of* golf, John Daly. They don't care what he shoots, as long as they're watching John Daly." More Bad News for Mickelson
- 1994/05/25/0689494	        In the 1920's and 30's he had pioneered the basic forms of jazz and hit high C's like no one else. His raspy voice is believed to have invented scat. He was the natural, the *Babe Ruth of* jazz, and before the word crossover had any meaning, he was one of very few black men who were listened to or watched by whites in an America so much whiter than it is now.
- 1994/09/05/0710383	        Lincoln's confidence in its vision going into the foreign misadventures was understandable. Lawrence O. Selhorst, chairman and chief executive of the American Spring Wire Corporation and one of several new board members recruited by Mr. Hastings, admiringly calls Lincoln's legendary compensation system "the *Babe Ruth of* incentive programs."
- 1995/01/05/0735173	        But not all talk-show hosts felt a burning need to be in Washington today. The office of Rush Limbaugh, the *Babe Ruth of* the talk-show circuit, said Mr. Limbaugh was on vacation.
- 1995/08/12/0781898	        Herve Filion, described by his lawyer as the *Babe Ruth of* harness racing, turned himself in to the authorities here today amid charges that he and two other harness drivers threw races at Yonkers Raceway earlier this summer.
- 1995/08/12/0781898	        "This is a 55-year-old man who is world-renowned," his lawyer, Thomas Mason, said during a 15-minute hearing before Judge Joseph Nocca. "He is, in effect, the *Babe Ruth of* the harness track."
- 1995/08/26/0784760	        Dean is called the *Babe Ruth of* arm wrestling because he was the undisputed champ from 1978 to 1986, retired, got divorced, went into a depression, ballooned to 700 pounds, then dieted by "cutting out the fat in my food," he said, came back to arm wrestling last year and won the championship again in October. Then, he lost two weeks later in his only meeting with Tskhadadze in a tournament in Sweden.
- 1996/07/06/0862685	        Precious is her name, but at the plate she is the power lady, the *Babe Ruth of* a no-nonsense league. She stares the pitcher hard in the eye as her bat revolves in tiny circles like a snake about to strike. The pitcher finally serves up a tasty offering. Boom! A grand slam -- Precious's third of the season.
- 1997/08/30/0953822	        For one thing, today's professionals play about four times as many matches per year than did Bill Tilden, widely regarded as the *Babe Ruth of* tennis. Schedules in other sports have lengthened over the years, but nothing like four times. It's safe to say that on the whole, today's players are better conditioned than in Tilden's day.
- 1998/02/17/0996027	        Mr. Peizer developed his high profile in his 20's, when he became a salesman at the Beverly Hills office of Drexel Burnham Lambert, where he sat next to the man he describes as the *Babe Ruth of* the bond business. Though he worked with and admired Mr. Milken, he said, he felt compelled to testify against his old boss when he discovered that improper things had been going on, ''and I wouldn't perjure myself, I wouldn't obstruct justice and I wouldn't destroy documents.''
- 1998/08/30/1042862	        That's when Mr. Halper, who grew up to run his family's wholesale paper products company in Elizabeth and own ''less than 5 percent'' of the New York Yankees, started collecting baseball memorabilia seriously again. The ultimate baseball fanatic owns the *Babe Ruth of* baseball collections, the biggest private baseball memorabilia collection in the world. It takes up an entire floor of his sprawling suburban contemporary here (plus two warehouses), makes everyone who sees it 8 years old again and nearly runs his life.
- 1998/09/27/1049648	        Rocky as he was at first, Gehrig, whose fielding skills were still notoriously deficient when he joined the Yankees organization in 1923, proved such a quick study and had such acute eyesight that by the time Commerce won the New York City public school championship in 1920 he was already being called the *Babe Ruth of* high school baseball in New York.
- 1999/01/17/1077956	        Even Jordan isn't always Jordan. The last time he retired, to play baseball, the Chicago Bulls' owner, Jerry Reinsdorf, called him the *Babe Ruth of* basketball.
- 2000/03/14/1183800	        It does not matter to people who loved him that Marino's last game was a 62-7 playoff loss at Jacksonville. ''He is the *Babe Ruth of* football,'' Mr. Molinary said, standing outside the Dolphins' training camp in Davie today as, inside, Marino announced his retirement.
- 2000/05/26/1202490	        Whether or not McGwire surpasses Aaron and his 755 home runs, he has been the most phenomenal development of the past five seasons. He is the *Babe Ruth of* baseball's new era.
- 2000/11/05/1244897	        I felt an uncontrollable giddiness. ''Grete Waitz! Oh, my God, it's a pleasure, no, no, it's an . . . honor to meet you. . . . in the middle of the marathon.'' Our eyes locked. ''You're the *Babe Ruth of* this sport, of this marathon! I am privileged to meet you!''
- 2002/02/17/1368511	        Mr. Sutton, then 52, was America's most celebrated criminal, a fixture on the F.B.I.'s Most Wanted List ever since he had escaped from a Pennsylvania prison five years earlier. He was a gentleman bandit who robbed scores of banks without firing a shot, sometimes while disguised as a policeman or a telegram messenger. He was a brainy ne'er-do-well who escaped from prison three times, read Schopenhauer for fun and loved to stroll through the roses at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Known variously as the *Babe Ruth of* Bank Robbers, Willie the Actor and Slick Willie, the Brooklyn native claimed to have stolen $2 million during his 25-year career in robbery.
- 2002/03/10/1374352	        ''I think Jason Giambi will be the next *Babe Ruth of* New York,'' Rodriguez said. ''He's the best left-handed hitter I've ever played against, period.''
- 2002/07/28/1411767	        In an exhibition softball game at Madison Square Garden, she hit a home run that went 260 feet. Babe Ruth, who was at the arena, posed with her and squeezed her biceps; she was called ''the *Babe Ruth of* women's softball.''
- 2002/08/25/1418681	        In spring training, Alex Rodriguez said Giambi would be ''the *Babe Ruth of* New York'' and called him ''the best left-handed hitter I've ever played against, period.'' Giambi hit his 32nd home run, which leads the Yankees, but Torre said the homers sometimes obscured the fact that he was more than a slugger. Giambi is a good, smart hitter who will take walks.
- 2003/01/19/1457551	        If Wilt Chamberlain was the *Babe Ruth of* basketball, the outsize figure who forever changed his game's frame of reference, then West was the sport's DiMaggio, its understated classicist. For 14 years, with fractured fingers and torn hamstrings and a nose broken seven times, he made a nightly statement of efficiency, effort, courage and craft. In 1969, when the N.B.A. needed a model for its trademark silhouette, it didn't choose the tallest player, or the fastest, or the flashiest. It chose West.
- 2003/01/23/1458686	        It was Feb. 19, 2002 and Eric Bergoust, the *Babe Ruth of* freestyle aerials, stood at the crest of a snowy hill making the last preparations for his final jump at the Salt Lake City Olympic Games. As the defending Olympic gold medal winner, a three-time world champion and the recent star of a national campaign of television commercials, Bergoust was, in virtually every way that mattered to him, on top of the world.
- 2003/08/22/1513834	        Arnold Schwarzenegger smiled down on us all. There were posters of him on every wall in the gym: in his tiny trunks, flexing his huge biceps, his oiled hair flat to his head, his gap-toothed grin reminding us all that we would never be like him. The man was our hero: the *Babe Ruth of* bodybuilding. I knew about him before he became Arnold Schwarzenegger, when he was billed in the back of cheap muscle magazines as Arnold Strong. But none of us ever really knew him until he starred in the documentary ''Pumping Iron.''
- 2003/10/14/1527211	        BILLY GONSALVES -- The *Babe Ruth of* soccer, he played on eight Open Cup winners (with six different clubs) in the 1930's and early 40's, including six straight from 1930-35 (he played for the runners-up in 1936, '37 and '39). Born in Fall River, Mass., Gonsalves, 6 feet 2 inches and 210 pounds, won the Cup with Fall River teams in 1930 and 1931 and New Bedford in 1932. He was then sold to the St. Louis club Stix, Baer & Fuller (sponsored by a department store), winning there in 1933 and '34. He won again in 1935 with St. Louis Central. Gonsalves played on the United States World Cup teams in 1930 (the inaugural tournament in Uruguay, where the United States lost in the semifinals) and 1934, and he ended his career with Brooklyn Hispano, winning Open Cup titles in 1943 and '44.
- 2003/10/31/1531415	        The Metropolitan will also feature the stars that played Seabiscuit and War Admiral in the film ''Seabiscuit.'' While these Hollywood horses parade, visitors can see film of the real Seabiscuit, including his victory over War Admiral on Nov. 1, 1938, and his final race. ''He was the *Babe Ruth of* racehorses,'' Mr. Balch said.
- 2004/03/28/1569940	        The treatment gaijin receive was also a factor as Rhodes chased Sadaharu Oh's single-season home run record in 2001. Rhodes had 53 with 10 games left, but six of them were against the Daiei Hawks. Oh, who is considered the *Babe Ruth of* Japanese baseball because of his 868 career homers, was managing the Hawks at the time.
- 2004/10/10/1617915	        ''I look at Richard Hatch, and he's the *Babe Ruth of* this,'' said Scott Zakarin, the chief executive of Creative Light Entertainment, which started a Web site in August called the Fishbowl, devoted to stars of unscripted television series. The Fishbowl has articles written by cast members, online chats with fans and an online radio program that ventures into the growing field of reality-show punditry. During the summer run of ''Big Brother 5,'' evicted housemates used the Fishbowl's radio show as a platform to continue the vendettas they had begun on television -- by the time the finale and reunion took place a month later, many of them weren't speaking. For this kind of showmanship, Mr. Zakarin pays cast members an undisclosed amount.
- 2005/05/22/1674615	        Turner, a handsome, whiskey-scented, baritone-voiced Virginian who blazed a dirt trail to stardom during Nascar's early years, was the antithesis of the modern-day racing idol. If he wasn't racing drunk, sometimes decked in a silk suit, then he was racing with a splitting hangover. He was fond of passing a mint julep-filled jug back and forth to other drivers, through the racecar window, while he was racing. The first thing he did, when dragging himself out of his car in the victory lane, was light up a Camel. He invited reporters to Led Zeppelin-worthy parties -- pre-race and post-race -- where a bevy of waitresses or a police car might end up in a motel pool, or, if the affair was held in Turner's self-designed ''party room,'' he might demonstrate how a fluorescent light could magically remove the few strips of clothing on the decorative images of beauty queens on the walls. ''You see a person, when they open the bottle, they throw the cap away? Well that's Curtis Turner's life, right there,'' a contemporary of Turner's told Robert Edelstein, a motor-sports writer for TV Guide. His impeccable biography of Turner (who died in a plane crash in 1970), ''Full Throttle,'' kicks up blissful dirt on Nascar's juiced-up early days. Turner's track record was dazzling -- he ''won more than 350 races, driving on any surface he could find,'' Edelstein writes, eventually earning the title of ''the *Babe Ruth of* Stock-Car Racing'' -- but his off-track record, especially in light of Nascar's efforts to remake their drivers as gassed-up Mouseketeers, was downright dizzying. (Allow me to lament here the great missed opportunity of magazine journalism: Hunter S. Thompson on Curtis Turner.) ''I've never seen in my life Curtis do anything halfway,'' Edelstein quotes one ex-racer. ''He partied like a wild man and he drove like a wild man.''
- 2005/07/14/1687227	        In physique, personality and production, Ortiz could be the *Babe Ruth of* the Dominican Republic. He is a big guy with a big swing and big numbers. He is, of course, Big Papi.

Shore, who played from 1926 through 1940, incurred fractures to his hip, collarbone and back, had a jaw that was broken five times, a nose broken 14 times, an ear that was virtually chewed off, and was a guy who witnessed all of his teeth being knocked out, and who needed 978 stitches in order to get through his 14-year career.

After all, who could ever again even challenge the 978 stitches (his count) earned by Eddie Shore, the *Babe Ruth of* hockey, during his 14-year N.H.L. career?

The last player to do it was George Foster, who hit 52 with Cincinnati in 1977. The last American Leaguer to hit 50 was Roger Maris of the Yankees, who set the major league record (61) in 1961. The Detroit record (58) was set by Hank Greenberg in 1938; Fielder's 49 is second in Tiger history.

His candid style took readers into private moments of his subjects' lives. Soon, Americans could immediately recognize an Eisenstaedt picture, and several generations of photographers, amateurs and professionals alike, tried to emulate their hero, the *Babe Ruth of* 35-millimeter photography.

"I wish he weren't so, and my career is dedicated to making him less effective. But, I've got to admire him. He's the *Babe Ruth of* civil rights lobbyists."

Upon reflection, Cepeda realized that he had not only injured himself but had brought shame to one of the island's royal baseball families. His father was alternately called the Bull and the *Babe Ruth of* the Caribbean. Cepeda was known as the Baby Bull.

"It reminds me of when the Yankees played in the 20's and 30's, and if Babe Ruth wasn't in the lineup, there was hardly anybody in the crowd. Now comes the *Babe Ruth of* golf, John Daly. They don't care what he shoots, as long as they're watching John Daly." More Bad News for Mickelson

His raspy voice is believed to have invented scat. He was the natural, the *Babe Ruth of* jazz, and before the word crossover had any meaning, he was one of very few black men who were listened to or watched by whites in an America so much whiter than it is now.

She stares the pitcher hard in the eye as her bat revolves in tiny circles like a snake about to strike. The pitcher finally serves up a tasty offering. Boom! A grand slam -- Precious's third of the season.

Schedules in other sports have lengthened over the years, but nothing like four times. It's safe to say that on the whole, today's players are better conditioned than in Tilden's day.

Though he worked with and admired Mr. Milken, he said, he felt compelled to testify against his old boss when he discovered that improper things had been going on, ''and I wouldn't perjure myself, I wouldn't obstruct justice and I wouldn't destroy documents.''

- babe_ruth_2002.tar.gz.txt:nyt_corpus_2002/02/17/1368511	        Mr. Sutton, then 52, was America's most celebrated criminal, a fixture on the F.B.I.'s Most Wanted List ever since he had escaped from a Pennsylvania prison five years earlier. He was a gentleman bandit who robbed scores of banks without firing a shot, sometimes while disguised as a policeman or a telegram messenger. He was a brainy ne'er-do-well who escaped from prison three times, read Schopenhauer for fun and loved to stroll through the roses at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Known variously as the *Babe Ruth of* Bank Robbers, Willie the Actor and Slick Willie, the Brooklyn native claimed to have stolen $2 million during his 25-year career in robbery.

- babe_ruth_2002.tar.gz.txt:nyt_corpus_2002/08/25/1418681	        In spring training, Alex Rodriguez said Giambi would be ''the *Babe Ruth of* New York'' and called him ''the best left-handed hitter I've ever played against, period.'' Giambi hit his 32nd home run, which leads the Yankees, but Torre said the homers sometimes obscured the fact that he was more than a slugger. Giambi is a good, smart hitter who will take walks.

For 14 years, with fractured fingers and torn hamstrings and a nose broken seven times, he made a nightly statement of efficiency, effort, courage and craft. In 1969, when the N.B.A. needed a model for its trademark silhouette, it didn't choose the tallest player, or the fastest, or the flashiest. It chose West.

There were posters of him on every wall in the gym: in his tiny trunks, flexing his huge biceps, his oiled hair flat to his head, his gap-toothed grin reminding us all that we would never be like him. The man was our hero: the *Babe Ruth of* bodybuilding. I knew about him before he became Arnold Schwarzenegger, when he was billed in the back of cheap muscle magazines as Arnold Strong. But none of us ever really knew him until he starred in the documentary ''Pumping Iron.''

Born in Fall River, Mass., Gonsalves, 6 feet 2 inches and 210 pounds, won the Cup with Fall River teams in 1930 and 1931 and New Bedford in 1932. He was then sold to the St. Louis club Stix, Baer & Fuller (sponsored by a department store), winning there in 1933 and '34. He won again in 1935 with St. Louis Central. Gonsalves played on the United States World Cup teams in 1930 (the inaugural tournament in Uruguay, where the United States lost in the semifinals) and 1934, and he ended his career with Brooklyn Hispano, winning Open Cup titles in 1943 and '44.

Rhodes had 53 with 10 games left, but six of them were against the Daiei Hawks. Oh, who is considered the *Babe Ruth of* Japanese baseball because of his 868 career homers, was managing the Hawks at the time.

The Fishbowl has articles written by cast members, online chats with fans and an online radio program that ventures into the growing field of reality-show punditry. During the summer run of ''Big Brother 5,'' evicted housemates used the Fishbowl's radio show as a platform to continue the vendettas they had begun on television -- by the time the finale and reunion took place a month later, many of them weren't speaking. For this kind of showmanship, Mr. Zakarin pays cast members an undisclosed amount.
- babe_ruth_2005.tar.gz.txt:nyt_corpus_2005/05/22/1674615	        Turner, a handsome, whiskey-scented, baritone-voiced Virginian who blazed a dirt trail to stardom during Nascar's early years, was the antithesis of the modern-day racing idol. If he wasn't racing drunk, sometimes decked in a silk suit, then he was racing with a splitting hangover. He was fond of passing a mint julep-filled jug back and forth to other drivers, through the racecar window, while he was racing. The first thing he did, when dragging himself out of his car in the victory lane, was light up a Camel. He invited reporters to Led Zeppelin-worthy parties -- pre-race and post-race -- where a bevy of waitresses or a police car might end up in a motel pool, or, if the affair was held in Turner's self-designed ''party room,'' he might demonstrate how a fluorescent light could magically remove the few strips of clothing on the decorative images of beauty queens on the walls. ''You see a person, when they open the bottle, they throw the cap away? Well that's Curtis Turner's life, right there,'' a contemporary of Turner's told Robert Edelstein, a motor-sports writer for TV Guide. His impeccable biography of Turner (who died in a plane crash in 1970), ''Full Throttle,'' kicks up blissful dirt on Nascar's juiced-up early days. Turner's track record was dazzling -- he ''won more than 350 races, driving on any surface he could find,'' Edelstein writes, eventually earning the title of ''the *Babe Ruth of* Stock-Car Racing'' -- but his off-track record, especially in light of Nascar's efforts to remake their drivers as gassed-up Mouseketeers, was downright dizzying. (Allow me to lament here the great missed opportunity of magazine journalism: Hunter S. Thompson on Curtis Turner.) ''I've never seen in my life Curtis do anything halfway,'' Edelstein quotes one ex-racer. ''He partied like a wild man and he drove like a wild man.''
