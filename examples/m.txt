nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	The project by a team of Vatican restorers to clean Michelangelo's frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, and in the lunettes just below, has finally concluded, triumphantly, after a decade of sometimes angry debate and widespread concern over the fate of this great work.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	Early in April, several dozen art historians, conservators and scientists from around the world were invited to Rome by the Vatican to celebrate the results and to discuss strategy for the next, and in several ways more complex, phase of the restoration: the cleaning of Michelangelo's ''Last Judgment'' on the altar wall of the chapel.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	The Sistine is no longer illuminated by the artificial lights that distorted the colors and modeling of the painted figures on the ceiling and lunettes, but by natural light, as Michelangelo assumed it would be.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	And the high-key colors now make perfect sense: Michelangelo used them so that the complicated painted scenes on the ceiling could be more easily deciphered without artificial light from the floor, some 60 feet below.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	If it is too much to say that there was a history of Renaissance art before the project and another history that must now be written, it is true that Michelangelo will no longer be perceived as he has been since the third quarter of the 16th century, when the recently completed frescoes began to deteriorate.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	The Michelangelo whose seemingly somber palette inspired generations of painters and historians has emerged as a different artist.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	The new Michelangelo may inspire future painters and historians in different ways from the old one, and it is no surprise that many people, who grew up with a powerful sense of the ceiling as it was, have had difficulty accepting the restoration.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	After all, the history of restoration on the Sistine has been a history of responses to what each century assumed to be the true Michelangelo.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	Restorers in previous centuries, who had none of the benefits of chemical and computer analysis that assist today's conservators, took it for granted that Michelangelo was a painter of dark images and they added what they believed were complementary shadows, highlights and other details where they thought these details had been lost.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	This, in turn, reinforced an idea about Michelangelo that affected future restorers, and so the cycle of restoration proceeded.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	The restoration has done nothing to undo the perception of Michelangelo as master of heroic figures and complex architectural forms.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	Michelangelo's use of vivid color in his painting at the Uffizi in Florence known as the ''Doni Tondo'' no longer seems like an isolated event.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	The palette that Rosso used in his ''Moses Defending the Daughters of Jethro'' of 1524 at the Uffizi, or his ''Deposition'' of 1521 at the Pinacoteca in Volterra, reveals itself to be as much a homage to Michelangelo's use of color as to his treatment of the figure.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	Most of all, the ceiling now relates in terms of color much more sensibly to the 15th-century frescoes that run across three walls of the Sistine and to which Michelangelo must have been sensitive.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	Critics of the Sistine restoration have repeatedly mentioned that no contemporaries of Michelangelo commented on the color of the ceiling, as proof that it could not have been as bizarre as these critics say it now appears.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	But the reverse is more likely the case: Michelangelo's contemporaries probably said nothing because the palette was not remarkably unusual for the period.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	The ceiling was completed by Michelangelo in two campaigns; elaborate scaffolding was erected for each campaign, and there exists day-by-day documentation of the events that occurred.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	The critics cite a reference by a contemporary biographer of Michelangelo, Ascanio Condivi, that the artist was unable to apply ''l'ultima mano'' -which these critics are alone in translating as a final unifying coat or veil of glue, like a varnish - to the second half of the ceiling before the Pope ordered that the scaffolding be taken down.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	But to assume the translation is correct means that Michelangelo did not apply this veil to the second half, and it is inconceivable that scaffolding was subsequently erected so that he could do so.

nyt_corpus_1999.har/03/14/1092077.xml	Thus Beck asserts that Lorenzo de' Medici intervened in Buonarotti family affairs, and not only ''would have encouraged'' Michelangelo's reluctant father to allow the 13-year-old youth to pursue a career in art but also negotiated his apprenticeship contract with the painter Domenico Ghirlandaio.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/03/14/1092077.xml	Situating Michelangelo a few years later as a long-term guest in the Medici palace, Beck vividly evokes a sumptuous interior decor that included treasures like the Farnese Cup and paintings by Uccello and Pollaiuolo.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/03/14/1092077.xml	Yet not even Vasari and Condivi, who seated Michelangelo at the dinner table, put him in Lorenzo's bedchamber, as Beck suggests: ''With a modicum of imagination one can envisage Lorenzo reclining on the bed, chatting with guests and perhaps even an attentive Michelangelo from time to time.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/03/14/1092077.xml	Although Beck devotes considerable space to exploring Michelangelo's relationship with Lorenzo (much of it hypothetical) and with Pope Julius II (much of it well documented), the world that Michelangelo inhabited with his family remains dimly lighted.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/03/14/1092077.xml	The artist's father and brothers take up less than one-fifth of the chapter titled ''Michelangelo and His Father, Lodovico''; most of the discussion concerns artistic productions like the marble David (documented) and the artist's ties to the preacher Savonarola (hypothetical).
nyt_corpus_1999.har/03/14/1092077.xml	While allowing that his celebration of the male nude extended to a masculinization of his female subjects, Beck denies that Michelangelo was a homosexual, ''closet or otherwise.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/03/14/1092077.xml	And yet Beck rejects the long-held view, promoted by Michelangelo himself, of an artist whose ''terribilit'' matched that of his irascible patron, Pope Julius II.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/03/14/1092077.xml	A close reading of the artist's correspondence reveals a kinder and gentler Michelangelo whose own temperament was ''a gentle and compassionate one.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/03/14/1092077.xml	Although the most vocal of critics of the recent cleaning of the Sistine Chapel frescoes, Beck confines himself in this book to Michelangelo's activities there.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/03/14/1092077.xml	His contention that Michelangelo's devotion to the concept of family in his own life inspired the overarching theme of the ceiling is intriguing, even plausible.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/03/14/1092077.xml	This fortuitous dual symbolism, Beck proposes, inspired Michelangelo to create a visual pun to amuse his patron: ''those della Rovere acorns are shaped too much like the phalluses of the 'Ignudi' holding them not to have been intentional.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/03/14/1092077.xml	Beck's formal analyses of Michelangelo's works are sensitively observed, but this is not the place to look at the art.

nyt_corpus_2002.har/08/20/1417221.xml	Both works serve as departure points for reflections on Michelangelo's response to the human body.

nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	A visitor to this gilded city is struck almost instantly by Michelangelo's creative munificence.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	Michelangelo, beneath it all, was a miser.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	That is one conclusion of a recently published book, ''The Wealth of Michelangelo,'' by a professor of art history here who found in Renaissance archives a surprising financial profile of unacknowledged wealth and unwarranted thrift.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	Although Michelangelo bellyached aplenty about deprivation and has often been cast as somewhat poor, he died in 1564 with the modern equivalent of tens of millions of dollars, according to the professor, Rab Hatfield, an American who teaches at the Syracuse University program in Florence.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	Professor Hatfield's research shows that for most of Michelangelo's nearly 89 years, he was marginally, moderately or massively rich.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	And yet, Professor Hatfield said, Michelangelo would complain to family members about how short of money he was, melodramatically bemoaning his lot while warding off their requests for help.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	On the road with a pair of assistants, Michelangelo would get just one bed for all of them, and the reason, Professor Hatfield said, was not erotic but economic.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	That research confirms, and adds copious detail to, something that art historians have come to realize about Michelangelo but many other people have not: any agony that sullied his ecstasy was not financial.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	Professor Hatfield homed in on that through several bank accounts of Michelangelo's that had never been studied before, during a research mission with other purposes.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	He was trying to come up with a better timeline for the painting of various scenes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, and some of Michelangelo's undated letters from that period, talking about that work, referred to bank deposits.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	Professor Hatfield wove together information in those records; the records of another bank account, in Rome; Michelangelo's frequently studied letters; and biographies of Michelangelo.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	Michelangelo was treated, and compensated, very well.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	When Michelangelo worked on the Laurentian Library here in Florence, he was on a monthly salary from Pope Clement VII that equaled about $600,000 a year, Professor Hatfield said.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	For a tomb for Pope Julius II, according to the professor, Michelangelo got the rough equivalent, by one calculation, of more than $10 million over time, even though he did not come close to completing the project.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	The professor said that the house in Rome in which Michelangelo died had little furniture, no books and no jewels, but it did have a chest with almost enough gold currency to buy the Pitti Palace.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	What kind of person did that make Michelangelo?
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	Fred Plotkin, an Italy expert who is working on a book, ''In the Footsteps of Michelangelo,'' to be published by Crown next year, said it was not surprising that Michelangelo's thriftiness was sometimes erroneously perceived as financial hardship.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	What is known, he said, comes largely from Michelangelo's own writings, the reliability of which is colored by his moods.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	Professor Hatfield thinks that the flawed popular image of Michelangelo as a person toiling without reward has as much to do with the kinds of narratives that admirers of artists prefer.

nyt_corpus_2006.har/03/29/1750394.xml	To this end, the British Museum has united its Michelangelo drawings with those of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford and the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, the Netherlands, where the exhibition was first presented.
