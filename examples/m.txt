''One of the primary experiences of being a sculptor is physical tangibility, being able to see and touch. I thought it was magnificent to encounter a Michelangelo cast that way. These experiences are remarkably rich.''

This is a tableau deployed on a floor paved with asymmetrical wood crosses - chunky variations on the swastika, painted bright colors. The white walls are patterned with lines of regular crosses in black and are flanked with plain white columns. In the middle is Michelangelo's Pieta sprayed in gray over a pile of empty white cardboard boxes. Lurking between the columns, meanwhile, are female store-dummies clad in black or gold lame suits, and the whole scene is illuminated by spotlights and fluorescent bars of deep purple.

In a 1985 article in the magazine ''Pantheon,'' the art historian Yvonne Korshak argues for the existence of a trumpeter and other Last Judgment images in the clouds and fields of ''Crows Over the Wheatfield.'' To the right of the ''Mountains at Saint-Remy,'' nestled in the hillside like a ''Slave'' of Michelangelo asleep within his stone - but also protective of the proud little army of trees and flowers marching alongside the road - there appears to be a reclining figure. If it brings to mind reclining nudes, it also suggests a painter with palette.

The narrator even marries Fanshawe's enchanting wife, Sophie (Hawthorne's wife, of course, was named Sophia), moving into his friend's life the way Jack Nicholson moved into the life of a dead acquaintance in Michelangelo Antonioni's movie ''The Passenger.'' With one difference: Fanshawe is alive, and only the narrator knows it. And that knowledge proves a dangerous thing. FOR Mr. Auster, writing too can be a dangerous thing. To compose a fiction is very much to be a private eye, gazing inward, investigating characters who may or may not be oneself. The closer one comes to one's hidden identity, the more harrowing the chase, and the novel's most vivid passages conjure up a true dark night of the soul. ''Something monstrous was happening, and I had no control over it anymore. The sky was growing dark inside - that much was certain; the ground was trembling. . . . I could no longer make the right distinctions. This can never be that. Apples are not oranges, peaches are not plums. . . . But everything was beginning to have the same taste to me.''
nyt_corpus_1987.har/01/09/0002058.xml	        The procession of figures, like a pedimental frieze or like the rapid succesion of images forming a cartoon, bridges fashion with high art. The figures show off, wave, yell and bow. Everything they do suggests a fashion pose. Every now and then, however, a figure takes on a pose that is reminiscent of an image by Picasso, or Degas or Michelangelo. The link between fashion and high art is theatricality and performance.

At the Morgan, he arranged such outstanding shows as the drawings of Michelangelo, the works of Holbein at the court of Henry VIII, and Old Master drawings from the Albertina in Vienna. During his tenure, the Morgan received several important collections of drawings and manuscripts, and he also extended the library's range of rare manuscripts into the fields of music and children's literature.
nyt_corpus_1987.har/01/09/0002037.xml	        The sculpture at the Frick tends to be small in scale, tucked away in niches or used to accent the paintings, and by and large not as distinguished. An exception, and to this eye the best three-dimensional work in the collection, is the serene ''Angel,'' very Gothic in the linear folds of its robe and wings, done by the French sculptor Jean Barbet in 1475 and now watching over the Garden Court. Some striking bronzes adorn the massive furniture pieces in the West Gallery, among them Sangallo's ''St. John Baptizing'' and ''Samson and Two Philistines,'' made after a lost model by Michelangelo. Of three works by Houdon in the house, the half-size ''Diana the Huntress,'' a classic nude without coyness, is my favorite, but this is not to knock his richly rococo bust of the Comtesse du Cayla in the Fragonard Room.
nyt_corpus_1987.har/01/17/0004270.xml	        Alexander Eliot raises serious questions about the current restoration of Michelangelo's Sistine ceiling. The restoration of so monumental a work must be able to withstand scrutiny from all angles and all perspectives. If that scrutiny results in spir-ited debate or heated discussion, it is hoped that the purpose of the debate is the better understanding and preservation of the work of art itself. Surely, this is, in part, Mr. Eliot's purpose. However, implicit in debate, discussion and even disagreement is a sense of dialogue. Mr. Eliot does much to damage that dialogue in his attempt to discredit the profession of conservation. Like all professions, conservation has good and bad practitioners, and it is important to curtail the activity of bad ones because the stakes are so high.
nyt_corpus_1987.har/01/17/0004432.xml	        As a young conservator, I must respond to Alexander Eliot's highly inaccurate and unfounded condemnation of the restoration of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel frescoes and of all art conservation (Op-Ed, Dec. 20).
nyt_corpus_1987.har/01/17/0004432.xml	        It seems feasible to assume that the conservators of the Vatican possess like qualities, and I therefore find it very difficult to believe that they are rashly stripping any part of Michelangelo's original design. If Michelangelo had painted large (or small, for that matter) areas ''a secco,'' in dry layers over the original wet-plaster fresco painting, I am convinced that Mr. Colalucci would be well aware of it and would proceed accordingly. However, perhaps the Vatican or the International Center for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property should arrange for a group of conservators to re-examine the work and agree on its completion.

nyt_corpus_1987.har/02/01/0009405.xml	        A solution to this problem is presupposed but not provided in Mr. Danto's discussions of conceptual art. Thus, he describes a ''work'' entitled ''Deadman'' by Chris Burden. Mr. Burden had himself wrapped in a sack and deposited on a California freeway, where he took the risk of being run over. This risk, Mr. Danto holds, was ''part of the work and responded to in responding to the work,'' unlike the perhaps equally probable but utterly irrelevant risk of falling from the scaffolding that Michelangelo may have taken while painting the Sistine Chapel. But what makes Mr. Burden's intention that we respond to his risk an artistic intention? That he may have gone to art school, or produced more traditional artworks, or even that he intended to make a statement about art (''Art is a risky business'') does not suffice, nor can just any intended response (our anxiety or indifference about his possible death) do the trick.
nyt_corpus_1987.har/02/08/0011596.xml	        The gulf between theory and truth is similar to that between faith and proof. Mr. Gleick seems to express the goal of his own search by quoting from John Updike's novel ''Roger's Version'': ''The physicists are getting down to the nitty-gritty . . . and the last thing they ever expected to happen is happening. God is showing through.'' Well, in a way, this has indeed happened many times. But a certain limitation must be kept in mind. For example, the basic building blocks of the human body are protons and neutrons. Both of these particles are made up of three entities (quarks), each of which is distinct, although they can never be separated - Michelangelo could not produce a better representation of a triune God.

nyt_corpus_1987.har/02/22/0015391.xml	        I see the flinch as a graceful thing, like the awed start of the Virgin in paintings of the Annunciation. Michelangelo's David flinches, in a sense, from his own epiphany, his inhuman perfection. If I were to choose an artist to depict the classically modern flinch, it would not be Willem de Kooning or Francis Bacon, but the dancer Merce Cunningham. His flinch might blend a crucifixion with a bump and grind. Up with the flinch, I say. I flinch, therefore I am.  I read in The Home Section of The Times about a family whose apartment consists of a series of spaces so strictly planned that they are obliged to give away their books as soon as they've read them. Putting aside the fact that they have six television sets they don't give away after watching and 19 speakers for their various electronic systems, I think they have misunderstood the way books work.

In its due alphabetical place between ''Hummock'' and ''Humperdinck,'' ''Humour'' incurs no obligation to catch the eye of whoever hasn't deliberately looked it up. That was, for its author, an unfamiliar freedom. So while rife with his local mannerisms - which may be what irritated later Britannicas into substituting something more scholastic - it's stabilized by his gift for roughing out the essentials of a large subject the way Michelangelo must have roughed out the Last Judgment.

Berg was a disciple of Arnold Schoenberg, the Viennese who developed the 12-tone technique; another Schoenberg pupil, Hans Swarowsky, was Mr. Abbado's teacher at the Vienna Music Academy. The young Italian had gone to Vienna after attending the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory in his native Milan. That institution is now headed by his older brother, Marcello Abbado, a pianist. Their father, Michelangelo Abbado, was an internationally known violinist.

nyt_corpus_1987.har/03/06/0019100.xml	        ''From the reproductions I've seen of the Sistine restoration, it looks funny to me,'' he said. ''The colors strike me as sentimental and unsculptural in a way that Michelangelo's other work doesn't. I have a gut feeling that it isn't right.''
nyt_corpus_1987.har/03/06/0019100.xml	        He had also seen some sinopia, or underdrawings, for the frescos in an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum, Mr. Motherwell added, and ''in terms of painterly logic, the cleaned Michelangelo doesn't seem to grow naturally out of them.'' Memories of the Original
nyt_corpus_1987.har/03/06/0019100.xml	        Mr. Segal, too, said he had only seen reproductions of the Sistine restorations. ''But judging from them, I felt strongly impelled to sign,'' he said. ''I remember the beautiful, subtle modeling of the Michelangelo work when I saw it earlier, and there seems to have been a loss of that. They may have thrown the baby out with the dirty bath water.''
nyt_corpus_1987.har/03/06/0019100.xml	        ''Some artists have a sentimental attachment to the dirty colors because they matured artistically with an appreciation of those colors,'' Mr. Persegati added. ''Their vision of Michelangelo's genius is based on a vision of the chapel with those colors and the sense of him as a mysterious, mythic figure is built around that vision.''
nyt_corpus_1987.har/03/06/0019100.xml	        Although the ''Last Supper'' restoration was undertaken in an urgent effort to save what was left of the decaying Leonardo fresco, there was no such need in the Sistine Chapel. Michelangelo's work, according to the Vatican, has been dimmed by centuries of grime. But unlike the Leonardo fresco, more experimental in technique, it is essentially in good condition. Letter to a Newspaper
nyt_corpus_1987.har/03/06/0019100.xml	        ''Will you go down as the man who destroyed the subtlety of Michelangelo's Sistine Ceiling?'' he asked. He charged Mr. Colalucci with ''the indiscriminate removal of a secco passages and veils of tone applied by Michelangelo himself.''
nyt_corpus_1987.har/03/06/0019100.xml	        The term a secco refers to the making of corrections and additions on top of the basic fresco after the wet paint on wet plaster has dried. In the past, Mr. Colalucci has held that Michelangelo was well-trained in the techniques of fresco and used a secco only to a ''minimal'' degree on the ceiling. But in a newly written and as yet unpublished article, Professor Beck disputes these assertions, citing passages from an early Michelangelo biographer, Ascanio Condivi. A Reluctant Artist
nyt_corpus_1987.har/03/06/0019100.xml	        According to Condivi, Professor Beck notes, when Michelangelo was offered the commission to paint the Sistine ceiling, he sought to withdraw because ''painting was not his art.'' And he wrote in a letter to his father, Ludovico, at the time he was actively working on the ceiling ''that painting the fresco was not his profession.''
nyt_corpus_1987.har/03/06/0019100.xml	        In an interview yesterday, Professor Beck reaffirmed his belief that Michelangelo had applied ''l'ultima mano,'' or the ''final layer,'' which he said was a coat of sizing or glue over the basic fresco. The sizing, Mr. Beck argues, would unify the colors of the work and also allow the artist to make corrections after the basic paint had dried. Rebutting the Vatican thesis that the artist did not apply such a unifying final coat, he cites in his article a further passage by Condivi describing how Pope Julius II, who commissioned Michelangelo's work, was impatient to see it ''even though it was imperfect not having had the final layer.''
nyt_corpus_1987.har/03/06/0019100.xml	        To this, Mr. Persegati responded: ''It's hard to understand why Michelangelo would have painted figures with so much delicacy and such detail if he intended to cover the figures with an animal glue that he knew would soon turn brown and grimy.'' In support of the argument that the glue was applied by later hands, he pointed out that cross sections from all areas of the fresco showed a layer of dust between the fresco surface and the glue, which indicated the passage of some time.
nyt_corpus_1987.har/03/06/0019100.xml	        As for the brightness of the restored colors, deplored by the anti-restorationists, Mr. Persegati said that Michelangelo had originally painted the frescos that way to be seen ''with the limited amount of light that comes through the windows or from oil lamps.'' He acknowledged that although no corrections had been found in Michelangelo's lunettes, or series of paintings done above the chapel windows, many had been found in the ceiling frescos. A number of them had ''been documented for decades, and many are now being discovered,'' he said. ''All of the corrections and pentimenti are then treated individually. The a secco corrections in particular are carefully isolated during the cleaning process.''

nyt_corpus_1987.har/03/06/0019113.xml	        Mr. Hartt spent much of the next nine months collecting evidence to buttress his first quick impression. And during a meeting at the New York Academy of Sciences on East 63d Street yesterday at which he presented that evidence and photographs of the model to five Renaissance scholars, there was general agreement that the model could well have been made by Michelangelo himself.
nyt_corpus_1987.har/03/06/0019113.xml	        When asked the potential importance of the find, the scholars said it could provide a glimpse into Michelangelo's creative process.

nyt_corpus_1987.har/03/06/0019113.xml	        Mr. Steinberg said that he had some reservations about attributing the work to Michelangelo on stylistic grounds, but that he reserved final judgment until he had seen the model.
nyt_corpus_1987.har/03/06/0019113.xml	        Pascale Honegger, the composer's daughter, who lives in Geneva, said in a telephone interview yesterday that she had given the small statue to Michel de Bry, an acquaintance of her father's, ''several weeks ago'' in exchange for a bust of her father. She said her father had owned the model and had believed it to be a copy of the David, not an original work by Michelangelo.
nyt_corpus_1987.har/03/06/0019113.xml	        That intuition, he said, was strengthened by his examination of the model itself in Geneva over three days last June. As a connoisseur of Michelangelo who had examined hundreds of the artist's works, Mr. Hartt said, the sensations created by handling the small model were identical to those created by the artist's other works.
nyt_corpus_1987.har/03/06/0019113.xml	        But the ultimate proof of its authenticity, Mr. Hartt said, would lie in whatever historical documentation and scientific proof he could muster as well as in stylistic comparison with Michelangelo's other works and the David itself.
nyt_corpus_1987.har/03/06/0019113.xml	        In some cases the model was listed as a ''small stucco model of the David of Michelangelo,'' and in some cases as a model ''del gigante'' of Michelangelo, using the Florentine nickname then used for the David.

The film director offers a collection of 33 mood pieces that our reviewer, Stephen Schiff, described in 1985 as ''literary doodles for films he never made.'' The sketches ''are sometimes mere fripperies, but at their best they are something more - plangent, haunting and refreshingly tough-minded.'' They can also be seen as ''a record of the fiction-making impulse'' and an attempt to claw toward the truth beneath the filmic appearance.  MONKEYS, by Susan Minot. (Washington Square/ Pocket Books, $5.95.) Susan Minot's chronicle of an upper-middle-class New England family with seven children is ''a rare book - a subtle, funny and often extremely moving first novel,'' A. R. Gurney Jr. said in The Book Review last year. Set between 1966 and 1979, the book consists of nine sections, each devoted to an important incident in the Vincents' lives and seen mostly through the eyes of Sophie, one of the daughters. The author ''conveys the special texture of life in a large family,'' the reviewer said.  DANCE: A Short History of Classic Theatrical Dancing, by Lincoln Kirstein. (Dance Horizons/Princeton Book Company, $15.95.) This history of classic theatrical dancing traces the art from its primitive ritual origins to modern times. Reviewers in 1936 found it a work of ''intelligence, scholarship and taste,'' and particularly eloquent in discussing the Renaissance beginnings of ballet. While Mr. Kirstein places the dance works themselves at the center of his analysis, another approach can be found in Walter Sorell's DANCE IN ITS TIME (Morningside/Columbia University, $14.50), a history of dance in its literary, artistic and sociopolitical context. Anna Kisselgoff, writing in The Times in 1981, said ''Mr. Sorell has researched an enormous amount and this is the first dance-related book to bring so many threads together.''  COUNTRY COUSINS, by Michael Brownstein. (Sun & Moon Press, $11.95.) Martin Kilbanky, the lunatic, sex-crazed hero of this novel set in 1959, has come into a fortune and sets about satisfying his two obsessions - his dream of building a house, and the body of his best friend's wife. In 1974 our reviewer, Karyl Roosevelt, noted the book's ''manic vitality'' and called it an example of ''fiction that is well crafted and yet experimental enough'' to be seen as ''completely original.''  BATTLES OF LIFE AND DEATH, by David Hellerstein. (Warner, $6.95.) A young doctor's casebook, ''Battles of Life and Death'' consists of 13 true stories -about a burn victim, cancer and stroke patients, a kidney-transplant recipient and others - from the author's medical school and residency experiences. Last year our reviewer, Mike Oppenheim, said most of the cases ''make stomach-churning, horrific reading,'' but admired two of the entries, particularly one about trying to reform an incompetent second-year resident, written ''with genuine insight and compassion.''  A PUZZLE FOR FOOLS, by Patrick Quentin. (Penguin, $5.95.) Patrick Quentin was the pen name of Hugh Callingham Wheeler, who switched to playwriting later in life and, under his own name, wrote the books for such Broadway productions as ''A Little Night Music,'' ''Candide'' and ''Sweeney Todd.'' ''A Puzzle for Fools'' (written in collaboration with Richard Wilson Webb, as were all the ''Quentin'' murder mysteries until 1952) introduces Peter Duluth, an alcoholic who gets involved in sleuthing after a series of murders at the expensive sanitarium where he is drying out. In 1936 our reviewer, Isaac Anderson, said the hospital, ''with its slightly mad patients and its coldly scientific medical staff, makes an excellent setting . . . and the author has used it to the best advantage.'' The same publisher has reissued two more Peter Duluth mysteries, PUZZLE FOR FIENDS and PUZZLE FOR PILGRIMS ($5.95 each). In the first, the amnesiac Duluth finds himself in a household of calculating women who insist he is their son, brother and husband. ''The sultry beauties and cushy California setting make this diablerie good warm weather diversion,'' Mr. Anderson said here in 1946. In ''Pilgrims,'' Duluth's unfaithful spouse is among the suspects when her lover's wife dies in a fall. ''What a predicament for an amateur detective!'' Mr. Anderson said here in 1947.  BREAKING THE SILENCE, by Walter Laqueur and Richard Breitman. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $8.95.) The authors reconstruct the life of Eduard Schulte (1891-1966), the German industrialist who tried in the early 1940's - vainly - to alert the Allies that the Nazis intended to exterminate Europe's Jews. The tale is told resourcefully, Henry Ashby Turner said here last year, but despite the authors' efforts, ''the man himself remains elusive.''  VILLAGE SCHOOL, by ''Miss Read.'' (Academy Chicago, $6.95.) Dora Jessie Saint, under the pen name Miss Read, has written some two dozen novels of the bygone days of English country life. The first, ''Village School,'' describes a year in the life of the headmistress of a school in a remote hamlet. A work of ''charm and grace,'' the book ''lingers in one's mind as something true, rare and lovely,'' Mary Ellen Chase said in The Book Review in 1956. The same publisher has reissued VILLAGE DIARY ($6.95), which continues the headmistress' chronicle of life at the school and in the village of Fairacre. The same reviewer in 1957 said the ''author has many wise things to say about the changing face of English village life.''  LIBERTY, A BETTER HUSBAND. Single Women in America: The Generations of 1780-1840, by Lee Virginia Chambers-Schiller. (Yale University, $11.95.) This history of the lives and works of more than 100 single women in antebellum America focuses on middle- and upper-class Northeasterners. In 1984 one reviewer found it ''well written, masterfully organized, skillfully researched, and highly original.''

As Vasari says, in his biography of Niccolo Tribolo, the first architect of the gardens: ''When Duke Cosimo bought the Pitti Palace, he wished to adorn it with gardens, woods, fountains and ponds and such-like things. Accordingly, he directed Tribolo to lay out the rising ground as it now is.'' Tribolo was followed by other artists - by Ammannati, by Buontalenti. Each left his mark on the broad, irregular sweep of the park: here, an artificial grotto (where two of Michelangelo's slaves once stood); there, an orchard of exotic trees, known as the garden of the ananassi (pineapples).

The model, you report, is a stucco cast from a wax model. It is mentioned by Giorgio Vasari, Michelangelo's contemporary, in the ''Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects.'' He wrote: ''So Michelangelo made a model of wax (un modello di cera) and portrayed in it, as a device for the palace, a young David with a sling in his hand: as he had defended his people and governed them with justice, so might whoever governed the city'' - Florence - ''defend it bravely and govern it justly.''

Mr. Danto rejects the view that any old work by an accredited master belongs to the canon of that artist's work. In a delightful illustration of the point, he argues that if Michelangelo had drawn a loaf of bread and a fish to apprise an illiterate servant of his luncheon requirements, this pictorial menu would not be art.

nyt_corpus_1987.har/04/16/0030667.xml	        The group said in its report: ''Overall, the state of preservation of Michelangelo's frescoes in the lunettes and on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel is essentially good, retaining the secco corrections added by the artist. The frescoes are obscured by uneven layers of soot, glue, salt deposits and numerous previous restorations. These old restorations, which lie on top of the discolored layers, were added to reinforce certain details that had become illegible beneath the heavy veil of blackened glue and blanching due to the salts. In a few areas, water seepage, condensation and the efflorescence of salts have brought about a variety of irreversible surface effects, such as mottling and hazing of some colors. All these conditions combine to falsify the grandeur of Michelangelo's intention by flattening the forms and reducing the colors to a monochrome that has misled generations.
nyt_corpus_1987.har/04/16/0030667.xml	        One of them, Robert Motherwell, said the report made him ''more confident, less worried about them proceeding'' on restoring the Michelangelo frescos.

nyt_corpus_1987.har/04/16/0030667.xml	        ''As to the idea that the cleaning has been 'taken too far,' '' Mr. Bull continued, ''it makes no sense at all. When you are on the scaffold, it is very easy to distinguish the buon fresco passages from the secco passages. Nor could there be any possible confusion with later repainting or retouching.'' (In buon fresco, or true fresco, pure powdered pigments mixed only with water are applied to a wet, freshly-laid lime-plaster ground. In secco, the paint is applied to a dry wall.) ''We all agreed,'' Mr. Rothe said, ''that the blackened areas of glue had to go. Not only had they darkened the colors that they had originally been intended to revive, but they had begun to tear off the top layer of color. There was also the problem that Michelangelo had worked on the frescoes for much longer than is normally thought to be technically possible. Ten hours, from morning till evening, is the normal span. But the wall itself stays wet, and pigment mixed with calcium hydroxide can be applied thinly in such a way that it still binds.
nyt_corpus_1987.har/04/16/0030667.xml	        ''That is what Michelangelo did. He put on semi-transparent layers of color that created a shot-silk effect that he could rework for days afterward. He also made retouches, or pentimenti, in secco. The present restoration has been completely respectful of these procedures. Differences of texture and of surface can be distinguished quite easily. It is quite certain that no pentimenti in tempera have been removed during this restoration.'' 'No Reservations Whatever'
nyt_corpus_1987.har/04/16/0030667.xml	        Mr. Brealey, whose many cleaning projects have included, the Mantegnas in Hampton Court, ''Las Meninas'' by Velazquez in the Prado and virtually every major painting in the Metropolitan Museum, said after returning from Rome: ''I'm not an expert in fresco painting, and I have no training in it. But some information may have rubbed off. I should add that I hate going anywhere in a group, and that no two restorers ever agree with one another. But on this occasion we were all completely bowled over. I have no reservations whatever. It was perfectly clear to me that wherever Michelangelo has made changes in another medium, they were all still there intact. Giancarlo Colalucci, the chief restorer, impressed me as an intelligent, sensitive and experienced man in whom I have complete confidence. It was also a great surprise to me that in technical terms this was an incredibly simple problem. It is quite extraordinary that so much fuss should have made about what is a perfectly straightforward job.''
nyt_corpus_1987.har/04/16/0030667.xml	        ''For me,'' she continued, ''one of the most extraordinary things has been to realize how uneven the surface of the vault always was. This created perspectival and other problems for Michelangelo that he solved with an amazing dexterity and speed. When you stand on the floor of the chapel today, the newly revealed modeling of shadow in color creates an effect of volume that makes us feel that the spiritual world is alive above our heads and that we are able to enter into Creation itself. With every visit, the glory of it all increases.''

This bulkiness cannot, of course, be reproduced in a small touring exhibition, but it is indicative of the monumental backing that lies behind the present choice. (For that choice, Jane Roberts, curator of the print room at Windsor Castle, and Andrew Robison, curator of prints and drawings at the National Gallery of Art, were jointly responsible.) As hardly needs saying, all the Italian artists so far named form part of the present show. Among others, Raphael, Michelangelo, Giovanni Bellini and Tintoretto make a weighty contribution. Given its scale, the show could tire nobody. Yet it is large enough to open huge perspectives for the imaginative visitor. The self-portraits alone - by Annibale Carracci, Gianlorenzo Bernini and Piazzetta - make us wonder all over again what happens when a major artist looks himself over and decides what to keep and what to discard.

Preserved between the industry of the north and the crafts of the south, the Florentine artisan is the keeper of tools and techniques that have changed little over the centuries. Venice boasts justly of its glass and lace and Naples of its ceramics and cameos. But it is primarily Florence that still has the quality cabinet makers, frame makers, carvers, gilders, restorers, gold and silversmiths and bronze and iron sculptors who are, quite simply, the best in the world.

nyt_corpus_1987.har/07/12/0056250.xml	        In those days, say contemporary artisans, only Michelangelo was paid to learn. Most apprentices started at 13 or 14, working elbow to elbow with the master, who was usually paid by the boy's family for the nuisance. Occasionally, as in Michelangelo's case, the debt was reversed. According to Giorgio Vasari, the biographer of the Renaissance painters, Andrea Verrochio put down his brush forever after being dumbstruck by the beautiful angel, so much superior to his own figures, painted in the lower left of his ''Baptism of Christ'' (1470-75) by a young apprentice named Leonardo da Vinci.

His sons have no interest in such a life of penury and patience. If even Michelangelo and Leonardo were poor, he conjectures, what was life like for the simple mason cutting stones for the street?

Engineers who graduate from broader programs come to see that the creative spirit they take pride in is shared by other disciplines.

Even if you took the charioteer from Delphi, Michelangelo's Moses from Rome, something from Persepolis and one of the grander pieces from the temple in Karnak, they would have a stranded, homeless, disoriented look. Grand plain sculptures wouldn't do, because grandness and plainness are there already. Our savage climate calls for a hardwearing quality that rules out anything that is predicated on finesse. The circumambient whiteness can also work against the art. David Smith can look after himself in almost any context, but his ''Becca'' (1965) is so close to the wall and so near to it in tonality that we can hardly see it.

It does not grow out of monuments such as Michelangelo's ''David'' or Rodin's ''Burghers of Calais,'' but rather out of architecture and design. It will be collaborative and functional: the public will be able to sit, rest and perhaps play on it. Since it is meant as a companion, one of its challenges will be finding a way to retain its artistic independence and purpose. It has to remain discreetly ahead of the public, maintaining its edge while concealing that it has one.

Tsukioka Yoshitoshi - 100 Views of the Moon Ronin Gallery 605 Madison Avenue (near 57th Street) Through Aug. 29 For anyone looking for an introduction to Tsukioka Yoshitoshi's ''100 Views of the Moon,'' this exhibition is a good place to start. The moon has had a long and distinguished history in Western art. Durer's ''Melancolia'' and Michelangelo's ''Night'' are part of it; so are some of the more alluring works of Joan Miro, Alberto Giacometti and Jackson Pollock. Yet this extraordinarily popular series of woodblock prints may be the only entire artistic series inspired by the moon. About 35 of the 100 prints are exhibited in this show at one time, some of higher quality than others.

Thank your lucky Muse: Mr. Sutherland never raises brush to eyeball to squint out a perspective the way movie-artists have done since the invention of moving pictures. But he does have a way of narrowing his eyes and staring at his model, letting us know that he is peering beneath the skin, through the bones, into the very nature of corporeality. O.K., but we've seen impersonators of Rembrandt, van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Caravaggio, not to mention Michelangelo or Moses, giving out with equally intense stares on screen, and it doesn't add a jot to what you can find in their work.

I ended up going there every day and doing all the things an artist is supposed to do, staying on the lawn, drawing sculpture, reading about Rodin. It was like being aware of being an artist for the first time. When I went back there this summer, it was eerie.

''Luther could read Homer in the original,'' said Emilios Bouratinos, the Greek cultural assistant at the United States Embassy here. ''Michelangelo was inspired by Greek sculpture. Galileo was saying the same things as an ancient Greek astronomer. Greece was an inspiration for others - Shakespreare and Racine, for instance.''

Whereas Michelangelo was always known for the Sistine Chapel, and Tintoretto for his great cycle of paintings in the Scuola San Rocco in Venice, and Rubens for his altarpieces in Antwerp, the work of Zurbaran was for the most part shut away in Spanish churches and monasteries to which not everyone had access. For those who got in, the rewards were great. Not only was the work often awesome, but it was seen intact and in its original setting. But most people did not get in, and even when foreign enthusiasts began in the late 18th century to write about what they had seen in Spain, Zurbaran's reputation lagged way behind that of Ribera, Velazquez and Murillo.

''The Young Toscanini'' will present the conductor as a great artist, but one who, like Mozart in ''Amadeus,'' is demythologized.

But he should ideally be a Shelley, a Beethoven or a Michelangelo, someone whose achievements are comprehensible and whose personality has at least a little charisma. He should not exist on an intellectual plane so rarefied that one would need an advanceddegree in calculus to understand his thought processes. His personal life shouldn't be so undramatic that, had he not made a single appearance in a police court for a minor homosexual indiscretion, it could be described as altogether eventless. He shouldn't talk seldom and tersely and then in what Mr. Jacobi calls ''a rapid staccato, falsetto stammer, like a parody science professor.''

His natural bent showed itself early - he had vivid memories of the pleasures of modeling in dough, while his mother was making cakes, when he was 5 years old; and by the time he was 14, after poring over a book of engraved prints of the works of Michelangelo while in the public library, he felt sure that he had found his vocation.

For example, in the center panel, surrounded by architecture filled with Roman associations, there is a sculpture based on a copy of a lost Michelangelo, ''Samson and Two Philistines.'' What the sculpture shares with the assassination taking place at its feet is violence. While a single heroic individual triumphs in the sculpture, however, in the crime one individual has no chance against the gang, of which the artist is a member.

Sir Lawrence got rid of all that by producing not a running, all-inclusive text but 115 very short essays that said what he most felt like saying and left everything else out. (This is beyond doubt the first book on the Louvre in which the entry on Leonardo da Vinci makes no mention of the ''Mona Lisa.'') No one can say that the book is addressed throughout to the beginner, but it would be worth long and hard study to make the most of the following passage about Bartholomeus Spranger (1546-1611), the Prague school mannerist: ''In his art, elements of Emilian delicacy combined with a truly Netherlandish grossness. No repentant Magdalen is more carnal than his. The physiques with which he endowed figures from the favorite pieties and myths had a gymnastic culture that combined the athletics of Michelangelo with those of Tintoretto and enriched the international style for nearly three-quarters of a century.''

His method, or style, is to find a run-down property in a prime location and go into partnership with a corporation that gives him enough credibility to obtain financing. This is what he says he did when he built the Grand Hyatt Hotel near Grand Central Terminal in the late 1970's: he got an option from Penn Central on the old Commodore Hotel. With Hyatt Hotels as a partner, he received a warm welcome from the banks. His timing was right, for in the midst of a fiscal crisis, Mayor Koch was offering tax abatements to encourage private developers. Mr. Trump's 40-year abatement on property taxes was worth tens of millions of dollars. Mr. Trump explains how he tricked the city into thinking he had an exclusive option on the property: ''Several months earlier, a city official had requested that I send along a copy of my option agreement with Penn Central. I did - but it was signed only by me, and not the railroad, because I had yet to put down my $250,000. No one even noticed that until almost two years later, when a reporter doing a story on the deal called the city and asked to see the original agreement.''

Touring the city reminds the visitor of the founding fathers' international ambitions: the streets are named Amalfi, Riviera, Sistina, Toledo and Michelangelo and are planted with lush vegetation.

The grotto-like pool is filled - and emptied - every day of its 820,000 gallons of fresh water and has been since it was built in 1924.

It had to be so, given Cezanne's secretiveness and the fundamental nature of the sketchbook as such. The sketchbook is the secret weapon of art. A combination of hotline to the unconscious, ace in the hole and confidential secretary, it deals with the unshared thought, the plan set aside for the future and the fugitive moment set down forever. Thanks to the sketchbook, we know what Michelangelo ordered for dinner, what Durer looked like when he had trouble with his spleen and what Rembrandt thought of the English actors who came to Amsterdam in the 1630's.

Relatively few of the drawings at the Modern Museum relate directly to known paintings. Quite often a wild and insubordinate humor runs free. Many of them are drawings after sculptures that range in quality from everyday educational tasks through versions of Greek and Roman originals to masterpieces by Michelangelo, Bernini and others. There are early drawings in which goatish fancies of one kind or another run amok, and there are drawings that document Cezanne's careful study of what the critic Lawrence Gowing calls ''the Impressionist doctrine of direct dependence on nature, never on conventional conceptions of it, which dismantled the description and substituted the sensation of what is seen.''

I never figure out a work in my head first. Even if I did, it wouldn't come out looking that way once I started choreographing. With a narrative work, you know where you want to go emotionally. In an abstract work, the music is all. When I choreographed 'The Heart of the Matter' to Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 2 for the Joffrey, I knew the music so well that the piece was already sitting within the music.

More revered today is Desiderio da Settignano, who was born in the village in 1428 and inspired by the older Donatello of Florence. Desiderio's indescribably delicate busts of children and gentlewomen were re-evaluated upward in the exhibitions of Donatello and his contemporaries held in 1986 for the 600th anniversary of Donatello's birth.

nyt_corpus_1988.har/06/12/0153457.xml	        Modeling has also enabled Tucker to explore personal and sculptural memory. He clearly believes that sculptors now need to dig through the entire history of sculpture. In the process of squeezing and pushing and pressing plaster, he encounters remnants of Greek and medieval sculpture, ghosts of Michelangelo and Bernini. His sculptures become places, platforms where dialogues occur and impulses and desires play. Controlled free association is essential to the sculptural process; it is also essential to the way we relate to the work. The actual modeling is as eccentric as everything else in his work. ''Daktyl I and II'' are amorphous white lumps of plaster two to three feet long. One legend has it that dactyls - ''fingers'' - were born when Rhea, the wife of Cronus, dug her fingers into the earth when in labor. Jung called these divine beings ''Tom Thumbs'' or ''Thumblings.'' Tucker's ''Daktyls'' seem to have been gauged and hammered, as if they were stone or clay. The sculptures change shape - turning into torsos or heads - but they remain the most abstract works in the show. They seem like pieces of comets, stone fragments sent down by the gods.
nyt_corpus_1988.har/06/12/0153457.xml	        They also seem like the clay out of which the sculpture of ''Okeanos'' grew. While ''Okeanos'' is plaster, its monumental mass and scale suggest carved stone. It has something Michelangelesque about it, not only in the imagery but also in the powerfully contained energy. But it is also different. ''By sculpture I mean that which is done by subtracting,'' Michelangelo said, distinguishing between carving and modeling, ''that which is done by adding resembles painting.'' To make heroic sculpture in plaster is a sign of the independence that lie beneath the traditional surfaces of Tucker's new work. He is using plaster as if for for the first time.

Yet it is enlivened by three factors. Metastasio's text was altered and adulterated by Michelangelo Boccardi in a way that heightens the proto-Romantic tensions (later in life Hasse would become a close friend of Metastasio, the father of the neo-classical libretto and a much stricter exponent of his esthetic). As a story set in faraway India, at the outer edges of Alexander's empire, it represented an occasion for the sort of scenic exotica and musical invention also found in contemporary operas like Graun's ''Montezuma,'' recently unearthed by the American Spoleto Festival. Above all, the plodding conventions of the opera seria genre were redeemed by Hasse's own musical gifts.

To say that there is any general improvement in this would be premature, but at least we have lately seen major and successful restorations of work by four great artists - Michelangelo and Raphael in Rome, Masaccio and Donatello in Florence - together with the beginnings of a new science of diagnostics that may help to make such things common form in the future.
nyt_corpus_1988.har/06/26/0156751.xml	        To begin with, we can say that in the ongoing and long-running process of the restoration of Michelangelo's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel, work has just been completed on what may well be the most celebrated image in Western painting - the ''Creation of Adam.''
nyt_corpus_1988.har/06/26/0156751.xml	        As is by now well known, the cleaned areas of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel do not look at all as they looked before. For hundreds of years, they had been known for the sculptural heaviness of Michelangelo's figures and his apparent reluctance to draw upon an extended gamut of color. It now turns out that both the sculptural heaviness and the restricted and often dusky range of color are historical illusions and a denial of what Michelangelo had originally done.
nyt_corpus_1988.har/06/26/0156751.xml	        Yet such was the power of Michelangelo that even in their disnatured state the frescoes had become part of the universal furniture of the human imagination. The degree to which they were false to the artist's original intentions in no way disturbed the epiphanies in question. The Sistine ceiling was for millions of people in the developed world the primordial, the irreplaceable and the indispensable esthetic experience, and they liked it the way it was.
nyt_corpus_1988.har/06/26/0156751.xml	        For this and other reasons the cleaning of the Sistine frescoes was bound to be controversial. Accusations whizzed to and fro like meteorites. The frescoes had been overcleaned, one or two people said. Michelangelo's ''final touches'' had been wantonly removed. Due care had not been taken. Artists of our own day, among them Andy Warhol, George Segal and Christo, petitioned the Pope. Could not cleaning be halted until wiser counsels prevailed?
nyt_corpus_1988.har/06/26/0156751.xml	        Michelangelo knew exactly what he was doing, used only colors that were suited to fresco and that did not change with time. He never dreamed of using the velature, or glazes containing binder, that were employed by later pseudo-restorers of the frescoes. What we now see is what he meant us to see, and we should remember what John Pope-Hennessy said in this context. ''Disruptive and violent'' as some passages in the Sistine chapel ''may appear today on grounds of color or imagery, there is no reason to suppose that Michelangelo did not intend them to be seen exactly as we see them now.''
nyt_corpus_1988.har/06/26/0156751.xml	        To those who think of restorers as witch doctors, ever anxious to scrape away at great works of art, there is something both incredible and in some way provocative and exasperating about the simplicity with which this particular problem was resolved. In the end tried and reliable solvents removed the filth of the ages without ever coming into contact with the fresco surface. Repeated subsequent rinsing with distilled water never gave any support for the idea that what Michelangelo had done ''came away in the wash.''

Of the palette that Michelangelo had actually used - a palette essentially keyed high, clear and light - there was not a trace. The glassy epidermis in question is not only disgusting to look at but a continual danger, in that it contracts in unpredictable ways and pulls at the very surface of the fresco. A better argument for not halting the cleaning could hardly be imagined.

This Michelangelo worked fast, as he has always been known to have done, and he worked with a concentrated daring and a developmental power that comes across in terms of experiment and surprise.
nyt_corpus_1988.har/06/26/0156751.xml	        Looking at the details that are only now revealed to us - a first tiny prickle of beard here and there, for instance, or the yellow fore-edge (the color of English mustard) of the Cumaean Sibyl's mighty book, we realize that the Sistine Michelangelo was not simply a man of monumental fancies.

nyt_corpus_1988.har/07/24/0164347.xml	        ''It now turns out that both the sculptural heaviness and the restricted and often dusky range of color are historical illusions and a denial of what Michelangelo had originally done. Yet such was the power of Michelangelo that even in their disnatured state the frescoes had become part of the universal furniture of the human imagination. . . . The Sistine ceiling was for millions of people in the developed world the primordial, the irreplaceable and the indispensable esthetic experience, and they liked it the way it was.''
nyt_corpus_1988.har/07/30/0165915.xml	        In the end, Mr. Sawchuck said, they have wrought ''dusk to day,'' rather than the ''night to day'' that was realized with the recent cleaning of the Sistine Chapel. There has been some disappointment about this lack of brightness in the church, said the conservators, as they call themselves, but the fact is Michelangelo painted bright, and Mr. La Farge waxed dark. ''The primary thing a conservator tries to maintain is the artist's intention,'' Ms. Hotchner was saying from the scaffold one stifling day earlier this week. Fans pointed at the ceiling blew hot air up from the altar.

''They throw out a lot of mattresses in this neighborhood,'' he said.

In Mozart's case, some of the musical examples are spectacular and provide the most persuasive evidence of Haydn's impact on his younger friend.
nyt_corpus_1988.har/08/21/0173029.xml	        Once the public is enticed into the museum with a promise of an original, special and absolutely unique experience, it is encouraged to think of itself as a rider on a conveyer belt. This mentality probably entered museum life in the World's Fair of 1964 when Michelangelo's Pieta was brought to New York from Rome, set behind bulletproof glass, placed under 24-hour guard and surrounded by blinking blue lights. Most of the public could only look and wave as three levels of moving platforms carried them by.
nyt_corpus_1988.har/09/02/0176164.xml	        Some works are almost minute. Rembrandt's ''Bust of an Old Man,'' from 1633, is only three inches wide and four inches tall. Its subject is an old man in a robe, his eyes intent, his body as agitated as one of Michelangelo's prophets, his left arm extended like the arm of a conductor or painter. Joachim Wtewael's ''Supper at Emmaus'' is four and a half inches high; the surface is copper. As in the Rembrandt, the lighting, in this case by candle, is dramatic. With its oval shape, the painting suggests a hand mirror in which we catch the moment at which the two humble disciples realize with whom they are eating dinner.

nyt_corpus_1988.har/09/18/0180199.xml	        Turner also belongs to this decade in his reverence for and distance from the past. The art historical references wandering into his paintings in increasing number are usually unassimilated and radically altered in meaning. For example, the elegant delineation and chalky gray texture of many of Turner's hands suggest those by Old Masters. But hands resembling Durer's ''Praying Hands'' either have nothing to do with prayer, or they suggest a prayer that cannot be answered. If a hand or finger resembles Michelangelo's hand of God, it is disembodied and powerless.

nyt_corpus_1988.har/10/05/0185205.xml	        The portrait of an anguished, open-mouthed woman was rendered in chalk on the verso, or reverse side, of a sheet bearing Michelangelo's drawing ''Cleopatra.'' The newly revealed drawing, believed to be another version ''Cleopatra,'' had been hidden behind a backing that was glued to it sometime during the 19th century, said Pina Ragionieri, the director of the Casa Buonarroti Museum in Florence, which owns the drawing.
nyt_corpus_1988.har/10/05/0185205.xml	        Michelangelo scholars have known since at least the 1950's of the existence of a drawing on the back of ''Cleopatra''; an image was dimly visible when the work was held up to light. But it was not until late August that the covered-up work could actually be seen, after conservators at the Uffizi, cleaning the sheet in preparation for the show in Washington, removed the backing. Two Moods of Cleopatra
nyt_corpus_1988.har/10/05/0185205.xml	        The work presents a figure markedly different in mood from the saddened yet tranquil Cleopatra whom Michelangelo drew on the recto, or front, of the sheet. Both show an elaborately coifed figure with locks of hair sinuously draped across the shoulders and the head turned slightly down and to the side. But while the recto Cleopatra is a finished, smoothly drawn figure, the newly revealed Cleopatra is sketchily rendered, with arched eyebrows and a ''mouth open, screaming in horror,'' Mrs. Ragionieri said. The outline of a male head can be barely discerned next to the figure's face. Both Cleopatras apparently date from the 1530's.
nyt_corpus_1988.har/10/05/0185205.xml	        The uncovering of this particular drawing comes at a time when Michelangelo is the subject of considerable scholarly reconsideration, and a number of works on paper previously attributed to his assistants or followers have been reattributed to him. Additionally, the cleaning of the Sistine Chapel ceiling has prompted a re-examination of Michelangelo's skills as a painter.
nyt_corpus_1988.har/10/05/0185205.xml	        The previously known ''Cleopatra'' was at one time doubted by certain scholars to be the work of Michelangelo. Bernard Berenson, around the turn of this century, attributed it to a certain Andrea di Michelangelo. Its highly finished state of execution was then thought to be inconsistent with the artist's style. A Gift to a Friend
nyt_corpus_1988.har/10/05/0185205.xml	        Most experts have since included ''Cleopatra'' among the artist's works, and its provenance has been extensively documented. Probably during the 1530's, Michelangelo gave the drawing to his friend Tommaso Cavalieri, who reluctantly made it a gift to Duke Cosimo I de' Medici in 1562. An inventory of Medici holdings from the 1560's lists a ''Cleopatra by Michelangelo, walnut ornament'' -implying that the drawing had been framed and that the verso was by then not on view.
nyt_corpus_1988.har/10/05/0185205.xml	        The Medicis donated the drawing to Michelangelo's relatives in the 1610's, and it has since been kept at the family palazzo, now the Casa Buonarroti Museum in Florence. As was common practice during the 19th century, backing was added to help preserve the fragile drawing.
nyt_corpus_1988.har/10/05/0185205.xml	        In choosing which side to leave visible, preference was given during the 19th century to the more polished version. Scholars who in later years held the drawing up to light saw that something existed on the verso, and in 1962, Paola Barocchi, the president of the Casa Buonarroti, said it was a ''bust of a woman'' by Michelangelo.

As an old man deeply concerned with his place in history, the artist apparently determined that posterity should not possess the false starts and reconsiderations these preparatory drawings represented. He wished for the completed paintings, sculptures and architectural designs to appear effortlessly conceived.
nyt_corpus_1988.har/10/10/0186679.xml	        But Michelangelo drew incessantly throughout his career, and many of his drawings survive. Nearly 50 of them hang here at the National Gallery of Art through Dec. 11 as part of ''Michelangelo: Draftsman/Architect.'' It constitutes the largest exhibition of Michelangelo's work ever presented in the United States.
nyt_corpus_1988.har/10/10/0186679.xml	        Brought together are immense architectural models as well as a number of the artist's most important works on paper from Windsor Castle, the Vatican, the Louvre, the Casa Buonarroti and elsewhere. Although missing the sculptures and paintings, which almost never travel, the exhibition provides a sweeping view of Michelangelo's activities.
nyt_corpus_1988.har/10/10/0186679.xml	        The show's ''Draftsman'' section begins with Michelangelo's earliest surviving drawing, from around 1490, a study of two figures after a fresco by Giotto in which the young artist's penchant for muscular, monumental forms can already be discerned. The section concludes with several poignant works formerly attributed to assistants or followers of Michelangelo but now believed to have been executed by the artist himself not long before his death in 1564. Unlike Raphael, Michelangelo apparently did not surround himself with assistants who could almost flawlessly mimic his style of drawing.
nyt_corpus_1988.har/10/10/0186679.xml	        The exhibition occurs at a time when Michelangelo's legacy has become a subject of much scholarly reconsideration. The restoration of the Sistine ceiling has inspired new interest in his talents as a colorist. The reattribution of many works on paper comes in part because Renaissance historians no longer adhere to a narrow conception of the artist's creative character as tormented and in a constant state of fury.
nyt_corpus_1988.har/10/10/0186679.xml	        ''Michelangelo: Draftsman/Architect'' devotes space to the highly utilitarian sketches that make up a large portion of his works on paper. Among them is a sheet from around 1517 on which he carefully described each marble block to be carved for the facade of San Lorenzo in Florence.
nyt_corpus_1988.har/10/10/0186679.xml	        With several of the works on display, Michelangelo drew only enough to solve a particular problem and then abandoned the sheet, as he did with a dead Christ whose limp yet muscular chest is delicately modeled in soft black chalk but whose legs are left in faintest outline. Preparing to carve figures in marble, Michelangelo first imagined the subject at various angles on paper, producing drawings of slightly differing arms, backs and legs that explored problems of light and shadow, mass and void that preoccupy a sculptor.
nyt_corpus_1988.har/10/10/0186679.xml	        Rarely a portraitist and, despite regular trips to the Tuscan countryside, never interested in landscape, Michelangelo lavished attention on the human form, elevating the male nude to divine proportions.
nyt_corpus_1988.har/10/10/0186679.xml	        The exhibition's most meticulously executed entries are, of course, the presentation drawings - drawings of pagan subjects done probably during the 1530's as ends in themselves and intended as gifts for Tommaso de' Cavalieri, a young Roman aristocrat on whom the middle-aged Michelangelo poured his affection. Depicting ''The Fall of Phaethon,'' ''The Punishment of Tityus'' and ''Three Labors of Hercules,'' these works raise the male form to an emotionally ecstatic, sublimely heroic level that is equaled in art solely by Michelangelo's own sculptures. The figure of Hercules confidently holding open a lion's mouth or wrestling free from a Hydra's tail provides an equivalent on paper to the famous tormented slaves the artist had carved in stone.
nyt_corpus_1988.har/10/10/0186679.xml	        For its section on architecture, the exhibition focuses on two projects that have been sources of considerable disagreement among scholars. Just what Michelangelo planned for the facade of San Lorenzo and when he planned it, and exactly what he intended for the shape of the dome of St. Peter's are topics conscientiously explored through large models and drawings, many of them by followers of Michelangelo and by other artists.

Millon, Craig Hugh Smyth and David Alan Brown of the National Gallery - provides scholars with answers to the complex questions surrounding the designs of San Lorenzo and St. Peter's remains to be seen. Among the inevitable lessons of this handsome exhibition is that the Michelangelo who could make such works and then wish to burn so many of them serves perpetually as a source of mystery and inspiration.

The title helps, of course. ''The Egypt of the Ptolemies'' would not be a grabber, but Cleopatra is one of the most charismatic women in history. With Handel's ''Giulio Cesare'' now playing at the Metropolitan Opera, with a newly discovered drawing of Cleopatra by Michelangelo on view at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, with Shakespeare's word pictures of her still quoted and misquoted every hour of the day, and with the current exhibition in Brooklyn to give a solid historical background, Cleopatra is present to us almost as vividly as she was to those who worshiped a gilded image of her 350 years after her death.

There's nothing so wrong with that - after all, they've been doing it this way since the Romans invented an architecture based on Greek temples. The truth is that for all the pretense most architects make about originality, the major inspiration for almost all architecture has always been other architecture. The Romans took from the Greeks, Renaissance builders took from the Romans and the Greeks, and 19th-century architects took from everybody. Styles are more evolutionary than revolutionary, and even the greatest and most profound of buildings have, more often than not, been variations on themes that existed before - new poetry created with existing words, we might say. Michelangelo used the language of classicism even as he inverted it to create mannerism; Nicholas Hawksmoor, Sir Christopher Wren and Sir John Soane did not invent a style, but stretched the inventive possibilities of classicism still farther; even Frank Lloyd Wright, the most deeply original of American architects, showed in his work the influence of Japanese and Mayan cultures as well as the culture of the American prairie.

First we pass the site of the Porta Nomentana, sealed up centuries ago; traces of it can still be seen in the surviving wall. Shortly after comes the relatively modern Porta Pia, named for Pope Pius IV, who commissioned Michelangelo to design it in 1561. It was Michelangelo's last architectural work. In Renaissance style with foreshadowings of the Baroque, it contrasts nicely with the ancient wall. Inside the wall at the Porta Pia begins Via XX Settembre, lined with government buildings. The name of the street commemorates the day in 1870 when revolutionary troops entered the city, which became the capital of the newly unified country. The storming of the city occurred just beyond the Porta Pia, through a breach in the wall made by modern artillery, which thereafter rendered city walls obsolete. The breach is now filled with a marble monument, before which stands a column topped by a bronze statue of Victory.

If you gaze at the recently restored Column of Marcus Aurelius in Piazza Colonna, don't overlook the charming marble fountain in front of it, a work by Giacomo della Porta. And a questionable copy of Michelangelo's famous ''Moses'' - the original of the seated statue is in the Church of St. Peter in Chains north of the Colosseum - can be seen at the center of the stately 16th-century fountain by Domenico Fontana a few steps left of the Grand Hotel. (Fontana means fountain in Italian, and the structure is affectionately known as the fontanone, a pun that may be rendered as Fontana's big fountain.) Noble fountains grace the severe Piazza Farnese in front of the French Embassy and the Aventine and Quirinale hills. Stroll from the Quirinale Palace eastward and you will soon reach an intersection with water splashing from each corner.The intersection is known as the quattro fontane (four fountains).

Crossing it is only a matter of steps, but this global seam separates today from tomorrow, the Americas from Eurasia, and the territory of the United States from that of the Soviet Union.

In a castle, a woman with flowing red hair looks in a fountain; soon Michelangelo's David comes to life and dances with her. As this 12-minute fantasia reinvents the story of Eve's discovery of desire, the woman swirls through the air and becomes entwined with mythic and legendary figures, including the serpent in the garden, St. George and Pegasus. She rides into the sky on the back of a lion, which becomes St. Michael, who slowly is fused with a serpent.

They are all mostly true, but the details have been refined, rearranged, brightened like the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel after the dirt was taken off. There are people who say the dirt should have been left on, and maybe they are right when it comes to Michelangelo. But when you are working on family history, it's a real temptation to make your pinks very pink indeed, to give your life and those of family members a form and a fullness that they do not ordinarily have.

Visitors to the show should not expect to be hit over the head as they might be by Titian and Michelangelo, the two artists who towered over the artistic landscape in which Veronese planted his seeds. He was intensely aware of them, as he was of Correggio, Raphael and Giulio Romano. He was promoted by one of the two most influential 16th-century northern Italian architects, Michele Sanmicheli, and he was an artistic collaborator of the other, Andrea Palladio.
nyt_corpus_1988.har/11/27/0201975.xml	        Veronese had the skill and savvy to demonstrate his understanding of his powerful contemporaries and yet remain his own man. He was not expressive like the late Titian, although some of his paintings carefully acknowledge Titian's achievement. He was not turbulent and fearsome like Michelangelo, although some of his nudes let everyone know that he was capable of a heroic dimension. (The Michelangelo drawing show at the National Gallery, through Dec. 11, is a reminder of the force of Michelangelo's personality. No ambitious 16th-century Italian artist could ignore or follow him.) Veronese depended upon clear images and firm drawing. Although his paintings may be theatrical in construction and Mannerist in space, the tone is rarely, if ever, supercilious or self-conscious. No matter how gory or sentimental the subject, the presentation tends to be understated. Most of Veronese's faces are strangely blank, even deadpan, and his people rarely look each other or us in the eye. When figures do stare, as Mary and the angel stare at Christ, no one looks back.

nyt_corpus_1988.har/12/04/0203772.xml	        MICHELANGELO: And His Drawings. By Michael Hirst. 304 pp. (Yale University, $40.) One of the great events of this year was the Michelangelo exhibition at the National Gallery in Washington. To see quite so many of his drawings, among much else, was the chance of a lifetime. The shaping hand of the English art historian Michael Hirst could often be detected both in the show and in its mammoth catalogue. This book, limited as it is to not much more than 100 pages of text (plus more than 240 related but mostly small illustrations), might have seemed to be a relatively small-scale adventure. But there cannot be anything small-scale, in any true sense, about a book that aims to give the general reader a brief, comprehensive, jargon-free account of the function of draftsmanship in Michelangelo's achievement. What precisely did he do when he drew? Why, when, where did he do it? What was the importance of drawing, for him, in relation to his painting, sculpture and architecture? Given that Michelangelo in his lifetime was the top man in all three fields, it is no small task to answer those questions.
nyt_corpus_1988.har/12/04/0203772.xml	        The answer is, of course, that drawing served Michelangelo in ways almost beyond enumeration. He drew to show the stonecutters what to do in the facade of the Church of San Lorenzo in Florence. He drew to deepen his understanding of ancient art. On occasion he drew to make a wonderful present. He made architectural drawings, prodigious in their grandeur and their lucidity (looking at his design for a rare-book room in San Lorenzo, we feel ourselves moving around in its secret spaces).
nyt_corpus_1988.har/12/04/0203772.xml	        He drew from a plain-spoken delight in the beauty of Italian men. He drew to feel his way toward an upcoming sculpture. He drew to give his patrons an idea of what they were going to get. He drew to tell a story, and to see how it would fit into this space or that. All this Michael Hirst tells us without haste, though with some unavoidable abridgment. As a general introduction to Michelangelo's drawings, this book would be hard to beat, and, given a deep pocket, you could carry it around.  *

With his heritage in medicine, he remained realistic about the potential of psychoanalysis for understanding homosexuality. ''It is not for psychoanalysis to solve the problem of homosexuality,'' he wrote. ''It must rest content with discovering . . .  [ and ]  tracing the paths  [ of psychical mechanisms ] . There its work ends, and it leaves the rest to biological research.'' And although he believed that psychoanalysis had much to offer the homosexual patient, his goals were modest: ''In general to undertake to convert a fully developed homosexual into a heterosexual is not much more promising than to do the reverse.'' But when Freud stopped short of developing a theory of the healthy homosexual, and his ambitious progeny misunderstood and misapplied his insights, psychoanalytic theories of homosexuality were dislocated from Freud's stance of humaneness, objectivity and humility to the ''Freudian'' posturings of cruelty, bias and arrogance.

He said that both times he would have received huge commissions if the works in question could have been sold as genuine Michelangelos, and that both times he had refused to authenticate them.

There were marvelous reaching leaps of great classical purity and a sense of power as he pushed his palms upward, like a male caryatid supporting an invisible load.

The man who witnessed the fall of the empire that had transmitted the bulk of classical knowledge to medieval Europe manages to have a chat with Raphael three months before the artist's death, and almost bumps into the ill-tempered Michelangelo.

They diminish the discipline and craft involved in art, while at the same time ignoring the magical, irrational element in creativity. As Flaubert himself wrote: ''The most beautiful works . . . are serene in aspect, unfathomable. The means by which they act on us are various: they are motionless as cliffs, stormy as the ocean, leafy, green and murmurous as forests, forlorn as the desert, blue as the sky.

One reason Michelangelo felt sculpture was superior to painting was that he believed sculptural illusionism was the goal of painting. For Leonardo, on the other hand, painting was superior to sculpture because the spiritual splendor of color was more aristocratic than the labor and messiness of working with stone. By making a sculptural surface as flat as canvas and by making ''color'' as heavy as stone - thereby emphasizing that color, in fact, comes from the earth -Mr. Anselmo seems to be trying to shake off both assumptions.

nyt_corpus_1989.har/08/20/0276847.xml	        Matisse was clearly trying to speak on equal terms with Michelangelo, Rodin and Cezanne, yet the ''Backs'' seem amazingly private. While Matisse was an artist of the largest ambition, there is in his sculpture, as Mr. Tucker has written, ''no desire to impress.'' He almost seems to have been building sculptural landmarks for himself. Matisse began the series in 1909, the year he was making harmoniously disruptive paintings like ''Dance I.'' The first ''Back'' exists only in a photograph and is referred to as ''Back 0.'' This nude is organic and voluptuous. Her body swells from the clay ground. She is all flesh. There does not seem to be a muscle or bone - or anything hard - in her body. The feeling is intimate, the sensuality beyond sex.
nyt_corpus_1989.har/08/20/0276847.xml	        The second ''Back'' was made in 1913, while Matisse was formulating a response to Cezanne and Cubism. Of the four ''Backs,'' this one is the highest relief. The figure seems not modeled but cut, like a stone or a jewel. The pose still bears a trace of melodrama, but the nude is stonier and more muscular, and she seems in the process of splitting in two. She has some of the dynamic stillness Matisse admired in Michelangelo's ''Night.''
nyt_corpus_1989.har/08/20/0276847.xml	        Matisse did not take the logical next step and build a life-size figure in the round. Soon after ''Back IV,'' he gave up modeling. In the momentous paper cutouts that capture the postwar feeling of liberation, he combined painting and sculpture in a way that is hard to imagine without the ''Backs.'' In the cutouts, as in the last two ''Backs,'' the female body is made up of discrete and magnetic parts bathed in light. Why are the ''Backs'' so inexhaustible?  For one thing, there is a constant sense of movement. In each relief something is happening. Through the series we watch a conventional motif expanded, opened up, stretched so that this female nude seems at home just about everywhere, including the Renaissance and prehistory. Matisse was carrying on many dialogues. The ''Backs'' have some of the monumentality of Michelangelo's and Rodin's sculptures, but none of the rhetoric. They have some of the weight of Cezanne's ''Bathers'' and Picasso's primal pre-Cubist women, but they exist in a space more stripped down than any space Picasso and Cezanne's provided.

Well, he did paint the greatest painting of all time, ''Las Meninas'' (not in the Met show, unfortunately, because of the risk involved in traveling). But that doesn't answer the question, although it raises a more pertinent one. Why do we care so much about Velazquez's degree of greatness? I think our desire to elevate him reflects a wish to reward him, not for providing museum curators and newspaper editors with a convenient answer for ''Who's the greatest?'' but for calming our anxieties about Old Master painting. The high art produced by the great artists we compare him to has an edge of coldness and an imposing unruliness, both of which distance us. We love Velazquez because his greatness is approachable. His work is warm, contained and manageable. His compassion for his subjects and for himself wins us over.

The best pictorial ideas of the 16th and 17th centuries are all miraculously synthesized by ''Mars'' into a new standard - the standard that ravished and astonished Manet, and a standard that does no less to us today.

Covering one wall of the cathedral's aisle, Barna da Siena's frescoes of the New Testament share with Giotto's best work certain qualities of color, grace and powerfully moving understatement. Across the aisle Bartolo di Fredi's Old Testament wall paintings include an extraordinary creation cycle - a wildly unsettling vision of Eve being lifted from Adam's side - and a vertiginous view of Pharaoh's army drowning in the Red Sea. An immersion in Italian Gothic art makes one a connoisseur of the tortures of the damned, and in Taddeo di Bartolo's ''Last Judgment,'' on the Duomo's interior facade, the sinners' fates are as imaginatively grisly as the quattrocento gets. Finally there is the cathedral's showpiece, the little Chapel of St. Fina, decorated by Domenico Ghirlandaio with two scenes from the life of the town's patron saint; we kept returning to stand and stare at ''St. Fina's Vision of Her Own Death,'' alternately dumbstruck by its beauty and jabbering about the injustice of Ghirlandaio's being famous primarily as Michelangelo's teacher.

The story of their origin - children should not try this at home - is that four pet turtles were accidentally dropped down a sewer in New York City. They got mixed into some ''radioactive goo'' and became mutated teen-age turtles, now standing upright, having exceptional strength and taking on evil in a cavalier way. The four, named Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello after the Renaissance artists, have a passion for pizza and adventure.

One sweltering day in July, after my wife and I had coerced our teen-age daughters to complete the walk through the Roman Forum with the promise that they could rest in a pew at the Church of St. Pietro in Vincoli, we arrived at our goal and they promptly collapsed. While awaiting their resuscitation, we saddled up to one tour group after another, listening intently as each guide spoke about Michelangelo's sculpture of ''Moses'' and sought to explain why the prophet was depicted with a prominent set of horns. Four guides, four theories.

It is worth recalling that Michelangelo's ''Last Judgment,'' completed in 1541, covered over frescoes by Perugino, and that the ''Last Judgment'' itself was altered several times, beginning as early as 1564-65. Moreover, recent examinations of Mantegna's ''Parnassus'' at the Louvre have suggested that, as with the ''Feast,'' this great painting's landscape was changed during the early 16th century while the figures were left intact.

Suggestions of weightlessness, flexibility, transience and insubstantiality are as fundamental to him as mass and permanence were to a sculptor like Michelangelo.

They are a boar and a rhinoceros, rather dim and cloddish African-like beasts with decidedly grotesque features. And of course, as a justifiably incensed reader points out, rock steady was a musical form devised in Jamaica in the mid-1960's, while be-bop is a form of jazz with origins in black music of the 1940's.

nyt_corpus_1990.har/04/08/0341705.xml	        Herbert von Karajan: It depends on the circumstances. In Ulm - as in many other opera houses years ago - it was vital that the conductor was a good pianist because he was not only conductor but also chorus master and principal repetiteur. But it is also necessary to know music making from the orchestra's point of view. In Ulm I shared the conducting with a man called Otto Schulmann. When he was conducting I would often sit in the orchestra in the middle of the woodwinds. I learned a lot from this. In practical terms, no one can learn every orchestral instrument. If you tried, you would be dead before you had finished the training. And even if you were, for instance, a good violinist you would never be as good as your best players. The important thing for the conductor is that he must learn what it is possible to ask for. Osborne: To an extent, of course, the orchestra is the instrument the conductor is himself trying to master. Karajan: This is true, and no one can say they know a score, however well it may be known in the mind, until it has been tried on the orchestra. There is a sense in which a rehearsal is the process of coming to terms with a great resistance. We know that Michelangelo regarded the marble he worked in as his own personal enemy. And we know the experience of pianists working at the keyboard. Gieseking once told me that he was given a new short piece to learn. It was about 10 minutes long and he had before him a two-hour train journey. He had a marvelous memory; so he learned, and went to the hall and played it. But then, he said, the shock came. The moment you come to play, the moment when you feel the pressure of the whole body on the keys - that is when the real process of interpretation really begins. And so it is with the orchestra. They learn from me, and I also learn a great deal from them. And only when I have experienced this pressure, through them, and absorbed it, can I feel that here is the beginning of an interpretation. Osborne: This is a process that involves the passage of a lot of time: learning a work on the page and then on the orchestra?

In ancient Egypt and the Orient, copying earlier works was a sign of respect and even piety. In Europe, where authorship was not acknowledged or legally protected until the Renaissance, medieval imitation was in no sense a personal or moral affront. ''Fake?'' exhibits some of the many forgeries of Durer's work and takes note of his legal efforts to safeguard his signature, an early attempt to have the courts establish the unique claim of the artist. But still in Renaissance Italy, a sculptor could legitimately test his skill by trying to pass his work off as ancient; the young Michelangelo excelled in this ''misrepresentation.''

Like the battered Voyager spacecraft flung out among the stars, the Viking landers sitting sandblasted on the ruddy dunes of Mars, and the paltry, heeled-over flags and scattered laser reflectors left on the moon by the Apollo explorers, it says more about us, and better, than we can know.

Until now, hardly any museums have put a dollar value for their collections on the financial statements they show lenders or donors. Most museums believe the information is hard to compute and irrelevant to day-to-day operations. They also see little benefit in flagging the enormous riches in their collections if it would deter donors and tempt thieves. As a result, many museums' most valuable assets, from moon rocks to Michelangelos, are nowhere on their books.

nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	        The project by a team of Vatican restorers to clean Michelangelo's frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, and in the lunettes just below, has finally concluded, triumphantly, after a decade of sometimes angry debate and widespread concern over the fate of this great work. The newly revealed ceiling looks overwhelmingly beautiful.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	        Early in April, several dozen art historians, conservators and scientists from around the world were invited to Rome by the Vatican to celebrate the results and to discuss strategy for the next, and in several ways more complex, phase of the restoration: the cleaning of Michelangelo's ''Last Judgment'' on the altar wall of the chapel. That effort, which has already begun, is expected to last four years and to produce results at least as dramatic as the cleaned ceiling. It seems that the predominant color underneath the now blackened surface of the ''Last Judgment'' is a brilliant blue.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	        These problems should not obscure, however, the accomplishments of the restorers. The Sistine is no longer illuminated by the artificial lights that distorted the colors and modeling of the painted figures on the ceiling and lunettes, but by natural light, as Michelangelo assumed it would be. The colors are not garish, as they appeared to some observers when the restoration was half-completed and floodlamps accentuated the shocking difference between clean and unclean, making the cleaned section appear flat and cartoonlike, as if shadows had been wiped away.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	        The shadows are still there. And the high-key colors now make perfect sense: Michelangelo used them so that the complicated painted scenes on the ceiling could be more easily deciphered without artificial light from the floor, some 60 feet below.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	        The importance of the restoration can hardly be overstated. If it is too much to say that there was a history of Renaissance art before the project and another history that must now be written, it is true that Michelangelo will no longer be perceived as he has been since the third quarter of the 16th century, when the recently completed frescoes began to deteriorate. The Michelangelo whose seemingly somber palette inspired generations of painters and historians has emerged as a different artist. The new Michelangelo may inspire future painters and historians in different ways from the old one, and it is no surprise that many people, who grew up with a powerful sense of the ceiling as it was, have had difficulty accepting the restoration.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	        After all, the history of restoration on the Sistine has been a history of responses to what each century assumed to be the true Michelangelo. Restorers in previous centuries, who had none of the benefits of chemical and computer analysis that assist today's conservators, took it for granted that Michelangelo was a painter of dark images and they added what they believed were complementary shadows, highlights and other details where they thought these details had been lost. This, in turn, reinforced an idea about Michelangelo that affected future restorers, and so the cycle of restoration proceeded. Every generation of restorers, in other words, believes it understands the original intent of the artist.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	        The restoration has done nothing to undo the perception of Michelangelo as master of heroic figures and complex architectural forms. But the colors that have emerged from beneath the layers of grime and previous restorations underscore the significance of his role as a transitional figure between Renaissance artists like Masaccio and Ghirlandaio and Mannerists like Pontormo and Rosso Fiorentino.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	        Michelangelo's use of vivid color in his painting at the Uffizi in Florence known as the ''Doni Tondo'' no longer seems like an isolated event. The palette that Rosso used in his ''Moses Defending the Daughters of Jethro'' of 1524 at the Uffizi, or his ''Deposition'' of 1521 at the Pinacoteca in Volterra, reveals itself to be as much a homage to Michelangelo's use of color as to his treatment of the figure. Most of all, the ceiling now relates in terms of color much more sensibly to the 15th-century frescoes that run across three walls of the Sistine and to which Michelangelo must have been sensitive.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	        Critics of the Sistine restoration have repeatedly mentioned that no contemporaries of Michelangelo commented on the color of the ceiling, as proof that it could not have been as bizarre as these critics say it now appears. But the reverse is more likely the case: Michelangelo's contemporaries probably said nothing because the palette was not remarkably unusual for the period.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	        As for the idea that glazes and painted details have been removed, the critics have never made a strong case, and to look at the completed ceiling is to feel even more strongly that they are wrong. The ceiling was completed by Michelangelo in two campaigns; elaborate scaffolding was erected for each campaign, and there exists day-by-day documentation of the events that occurred. The critics cite a reference by a contemporary biographer of Michelangelo, Ascanio Condivi, that the artist was unable to apply ''l'ultima mano'' -which these critics are alone in translating as a final unifying coat or veil of glue, like a varnish - to the second half of the ceiling before the Pope ordered that the scaffolding be taken down.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	        They contend this reference is evidence that a veil of glue was supposed to cover the entire ceiling and that it has been removed by the restorers. But to assume the translation is correct means that Michelangelo did not apply this veil to the second half, and it is inconceivable that scaffolding was subsequently erected so that he could do so. Such an elaborate construction project would have been documented.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	        The critics seem to be proposing, in other words, that as much as half the ceiling was, in the end, not covered by this glue, a suggestion that implies a bizarre spectacle, like a partly varnished chair, with some of the ceiling left brightly colored and some of it painted over by the veil. Contemporaries of Michelangelo could not have failed to comment on this, if it had been the case.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	        The restorers have concluded that Michelangelo worked almost exclusively in true fresco, or with water-based pigments on wet plaster. Secco passages, or passages the artist applied to dry plaster, have been discovered, however, and they have not been touched by the Vatican team. Although critics point to the fact that such details as the pupils of eyes have occasionally been removed, the evidence is that the pupils were added by previous restorers.
nyt_corpus_1990.har/05/14/0353209.xml	        In the end, even if a few mistakes turn out to have been made, these must not overshadow the general quality of the project. The Sistine ceiling may no longer look the way some people think Michelangelo should look, but that says more about the expectations of those people than about the results of this extraordinary restoration.

She follows him to Paris, where he studied with Matisse and looked hard at Picasso and Cezanne.

While Schnabel uses reproductions of the Sibyl from the Sistine ceiling in some drawings, Alison Saar recapitulates Michelangelo's ''Dying Slave'' as a powerfully built black man with a stomach cavity of rusted iron, that conjures up intestinal fortitude, a gaping wound and an African past. Her work makes one more than ever aware of the men's-club exclusivity of Neo-Expressionism; it's entirely possible to imagine her art from the early 80's beside A. R.

Leo Steinberg, a prominent art historian and writer at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, mentioned an example of what he calls doctors' ''naive notions.'' After viewing Michelangelo's Pieta in Rome, a doctor complained to Dr. Steinberg that the arms and the hands of the dead Christ showed engorged veins, when everyone should know, the doctor said, that the surface veins flatten when the heart stops.

Michelangelo probably learned the fine details of neuroanatomy just as he did the parts of the rest of the body, Dr. Meshberger says: by dissecting corpses. He points out that in the 16th century, Giorgio Vasari wrote in ''Lives of the Artists'' that ''Michelangelo very often used to flay dead bodies in order to discover the secrets of anatomy.''

Unlike Leonardo da Vinci or Michelangelo, Titian has left us very few words, and those few deal primarily with matters of business and were probably drafted by friends. Nor do we fully understand his art, especially not the art of his later years. And yet that art may in fact be closer to us than any other painting of the past.

In this image of profound personal piety, which he intended to grace his own tomb, the painter portrayed himself in the guise of St. Jerome, reaching out to the lifeless body of Christ. Here, the experience of molding the divine human form with his own hands can hardly have been a merely esthetic experience for Titian. Like Michelangelo in his late, personal sculpture and, especially, in his late, overworked drawings of the crucified Christ, Titian, in painting this image, must have felt in intimate, privileged touch with his savior.

From the beginning he seems to have been ready to take on all comers in a fiercely competitive Venetian art scene that was presided over in his youth by Giovanni Bellini (who died in 1516) and Giorgione (who died of plague in 1510). Titian worked with both of them. Eventually he would be challenged as the artistic king of Venice by Veronese and Tintoretto. Throughout his career he would be asked to meet the challenges of Raphael and Michelangelo. To survive and flourish, Titian probably had to be as composed, cunning and wary as many of the powerful people he painted.

Alfred Prufrock" serves as a leitmotif for Waldemar Januszczak's "Sayonara, Michelangelo," an idiosyncratic riff about the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Near the beginning of the book, for example, Mr. Januszczak gives us: In the room impeccably turned-out Italian schoolkids in unending herds come and go  Talking (loudly) of anything but Michelangelo.  Or, stretching even farther, he produces: In the room visiting art historians taking advantage of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity come and go  Talking of Michelangelo and asking whether or not the restoration has irrevocably ruined the fresco.

However, fascinating as these comparisons may be, it seems to me that placing Warhol's "Diaries" on the same level as Michelangelo's sonnets, as Mr. Januszczak does, is skating on pretty thin ice, and comparing Warhol's relationship to Bianca Jagger with Michelangelo's relationship to Vittoria Colonna is virtually skating on water.

There are pages where Mr. Januszczak blithely skips from fact to fiction, creating a group of half-real, half-imagined characters involved in elaborate colloquies about obscure iconographic matters. As far as I can tell, only one of the characters is easily recognizable: Professor Edgar Zephyr, the author of "Mysterious Pagans in the Renaissance," is obviously Edgar Wind, the author of "Pagan Mysteries in the Renaissance."

For instance, after an elaborate discussion of the section of the ceiling concerning Lot and his daughters, the matter is dropped without any clear explanation of Michelangelo's intent. Perhaps Mr. Januszczak was simply making an oblique reference to Michelangelo's sexuality, a matter he treats at length, and with more discretion than necessary. Michelangelo was almost certainly homosexual. The women in his paintings and sculpture are clearly based on male anatomy, with unconvincing appendages for breasts, overdeveloped shoulders and bizarre proportions. All this was evident before the cleaning. Why reiterate it in such detail here?

Many of them, especially Americans, wrote letters of denunciation, objecting to what they saw as the desecration of a masterpiece. In point of fact, the violently dissonant juxtaposition of brilliant colors that emerged on the Sistine ceiling could be verified as the true colors Michelangelo used by comparing them with those used by his ardent follower Jacopo da Pontormo in the Capponi Chapel in the Church of Santa Felicita in Florence.

In addition, there are seldom-seen examples of the work of Sturtevant, heretofore known as Elaine Sturtevant, and J. St. Bernard, heretofore known as John Dogg.

Like Pontormo and Rosso, his slightly younger contemporaries in Florence, Beccafumi pushed painting in new, unorthodox directions of expression and composition, inspired in part by the impact of Michelangelo's Sistine Ceiling. However, he did not suffer from the neuroses that plagued Pontormo or from the restless temperament that drove Rosso from place to place, and the emotional fabric of his pictures is accessible to a wider audience.

Jesse Helms took on Robert Mapplethorpe, Florida went after the 2 Live Crew, and Broadway wondered whether "Miss Saigon" would be bygone.  What follows is a highly selective calendar of the year's most memorable moments -- and a few best forgotten. JANUARY  Jan. 8  All About Deb: Jane Pauley is replaced by the younger, blonder, bubblier Deborah Norville on NBC's "Today" show, and America begins to tune out in droves.  There Is No Net: California Superior Court orders Paramount to pay Art Buchwald for an idea that became the Eddie Murphy film "Coming to America." Showing more originality in bookkeeping than in screenwriting, Paramount claimed a net loss of $18 million for a film that grossed over $275 million, and concluded that it owed Buchwald nothing.  Jan. 9  Un Bel Helicopter: Cameron Mackintosh says he can't find a theater in New York big enough for his new musical "Miss Saigon," a retelling of the Madame Butterfly story set in Vietnam, in which a chopper lands on the stage. Jan. 10  The Bloom Is Off: Alan Bond, the Australian entrepreneur who had bought van Gogh's "Irises" for a record $53.9 million in 1987, puts the painting back on the market. The Getty got it.  Jan. 14  Pas de Misha: American Ballet Theater celebrates its 50th year with a gala at the Metropolitan Opera House; notably absent is the former artistic director Mikhail Baryshnikov, who had resigned in a dispute with the company's board.  Jan. 15  No Tomorrow: The $7 million production of "Annie 2: Miss Hannigan's Revenge" flops on the road. Producers plan instead to revive the original "Annie" on Broadway, but Miss Hannigan's had it: Dorothy Loudon, who created the role, pulls out.  Jan. 21  You Say Lambada, I Say Lumbago: Kaoma, the group that has sold four million copies of its single, "The Lambada," tours the country, setting off the most hyped -- and least danceable -- disco craze since Da Butt.  FEBRUARY Feb. 2  Not Even a Contender: The Philadelphia Museum of Art insists that an 800-pound, 8 1/2-foot bronze sculpture of Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa be removed from its plaza after the filming of "Rocky V" winds up. Feb. 8  A Few Minutes Without . . . : Andy Rooney is suspended from CBS's "60 Minutes" for three months after suggesting that blacks were less intelligent because they "watered down their genes." Previously he had offended homosexuals by commenting that gay sex led to premature deaths.  But ratings slid, and he returned after only one month.  Feb. 10  He Learned It in Kindergarten : The best-selling pop homilist Robert ("Everything He Needs to Know") Fulghum leads the Minneapolis Chamber Symphony in Beethoven's Ninth, even though he can't read music.  Feb. 16  Less Is More: The Guggenheim Museum acquires a collection of more than 300 mostly Minimalist works from the 60's and 70's, some of them no more than plans on paper, for a price believed to be around $30 million. To foot the bill, it sold major paintings by Modigliani, Kandinsky and Chagall.

MARCH  March 2  Maestro Dearest: The conductor Zubin Mehta upbraids the audience at a New York Philharmonic concert for coughing and generally making too much noise. March 4  Get Thee Behind Me, Ozzy Osbourne: John Cardinal O'Connor, preaching the Gospel about Satan's tempting Jesus in the desert, cites reports of growing Satanic cult activity among youth and the impact of satanic imagery in rock.  March 5  He Knew It When He Saw It: Congressional hearings begin on whether to keep the National Endowment for the Arts in business. Senator Jesse Helms, reacting to an exhibition of Robert Mapplethorpe's sexually explicit photographs, seeks tough controls on Federally financed art.  March 16  Meanwhile, Back at the Lambada: Two movies about the exotic dance are released: "Lambada!" (math teacher by day, dancer by night) and "The Forbidden Dance" (an Amazon Indian princess goes to Los Angeles to save the rain forest and becomes a lambadan).  March 18  The Bad News: Twelve works assessed at more than $200 million are stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston by thieves dressed as police officers. March 19  The Worse News: They weren't insured.  March 21  Purple Haze: Kathleen Turner takes on Maggie in the Broadway production of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," performing the first act in a lavender slip (lined) instead of the de rigueur white.

DECEMBER  Dec. 3  Justify My Ratings: ABC's "Nightline" broadcasts Madonna's video "Justify My Love." The program's overnight ratings are second only to those for Tammy Faye Bakker's crying jag. Dec. 14  What About Raggedy Ann?: Disney stops selling its new doll, Steve the Tramp, a miniature bum modeled on a character in "Dick Tracy," after homeless advocates protested.

nyt_corpus_1990.har/12/30/0411773.xml	        In the cases of Velazquez in Madrid and Titian in Venice -- as with Masaccio in Florence, Beccafumi in Siena, Vouet in Paris and Michelangelo at the Vatican -- this was also a year in which major artists of the past were honored, to greater and lesser results, in places where their reputations had substantially been made. To that list of European masters can be added the name of an American master, Albert Pinkham Ryder, the turn-of-the-century New Yorker whose paintings were celebrated in a wonderful show that came to the Brooklyn Museum this fall. (It was organized at the National Museum of American Art in Washington, where it first appeared.)
nyt_corpus_1990.har/12/30/0411773.xml	        But there were triumphs of longer-lasting significance. The project to clean the Sistine ceiling ended and Michelangelo's fresco was revealed in all its coloristic splendor (work has begun on the restoration of the Last Judgment in the Sistine). Equally important and no less admired were the newly cleaned frescoes by Masaccio and Masolino in the Brancacci Chapel in Florence.

Fuseli studied Michelangelo intensely and, like him, remained committed to the firmly muscled, well-proportioned male nude.
nyt_corpus_1991.har/01/04/0412998.xml	        But Fuseli was the child of a more secular, revolutionary age, and he did not have Michelangelo's desperate yearning for Christian redemption and grace. The sexuality, including the homoeroticism, that is restrained in Michelangelo's nudes begins to rumble in Fuseli's paintings and drawings. With Fuseli, the ideal male nude suddenly seems emotionally exposed and truly naked.

It still had its glorious and unspoiled site on the Sarasota Bay. A copy of the "Apollo Belvedere" still stood before the front door. Out back, a copy of Michelangelo's "David" stood guard before a backdrop of palm trees. On velvet evenings and new-moon nights, bayou and banyan wrought their magic, and rooftop statues by the score gleamed as white as ever. At such moments, the museum still looked like one of the more remarkable of 20th-century imaginings.

Michelangelo's "David," in front of the town hall, was replaced and the original moved into the Accademia di Belle Arti more than a century ago. Prophets and sibyls have been plucked from their niches.

Here, too, Ms. Charlesworth is trying to bring her sense of reality to familiar or easily idealized images. Her work may be irreverent, as in her juxtaposition of a Michelangelo friar with his hand on his crotch and one of Bosch's characteristic Mapplethorpe-like images.

His sculptures of dancers, bathers, jockeys and horses, set on slabs of wood and puddles of waxy earth, appear almost artless. Degas made them for himself and friends. They are not heroic. They are not monuments to rival Michelangelo and the Greeks. They are private and silent, always searching and often tender. Degas's humility in a medium in which he was not trained and which he felt he could not master helps explain the honesty and modesty of these works. In them, an artist known for his biting, sometimes corrosive irony let down his guard and gave of himself in an informal, uninhibited and unironic way.

nyt_corpus_1991.har/05/17/0445997.xml	        Fair enough, but the issues under debate are far too complex to be illuminated by the plain dramatic elements of this 75-minute work. "States of Shock" does not really go anywhere intellectually or theatrically once it has established its basic thematic attack. Instead it mechanically imposes its ideas on some typical Shepard conceits: The play's fratricidal men trade aspects of their identities, mythos-laden American songs (notably "Goodnight Irene") swamp the action, a buried child will not rest in peace. Gradually Mr. Malkovich resorts to ranting and raving in his "Burn This" manner to counteract the inertia. At the same time, the special effects, punctuated by offstage percussionists, reach the apocalyptic proportions of Mr. Shepard's collaboration with Michelangelo Antonioni on "Zabriskie Point." Something of a nadir is reached when the sight of a male diner masturbating is accompanied by images of familial and battlefield brutality. Surely Mae West made the analogy between machismo and weaponry with rather more wit.
nyt_corpus_1991.har/05/19/0446684.xml	        To elicit respect in many countries, a piece of sculpture would probably need to be classical in its harmonious equilibrium. If it were to swing too far in any one direction, for example, if it were too expressive or individualistic, many cultures would be unwilling or unable to respond. The restlessness and torment of some of Michelangelo's sculpture may well cut it off from Africa, Latin America and Asia, where the idea of a heroic individual struggle is alien.

Today this backdrop for the almost 400 figures of the giant fresco is a gloomy dark blue and gray. But tests have shown that the sky, which covers almost one-fourth of the painting, will be transformed into a vast expanse of brilliant blue. Mr. Colalucci said analysis had confirmed that Michelangelo painted the sky with the potent blue pigment of lapis lazuli.  Terrifying a Pope
nyt_corpus_1991.har/06/19/0453771.xml	        Art historians are also eager to see whether the great Renaissance master changed his methods and techniques as he grew more experienced. He made the mighty figures of the Creation on the ceiling -- apparently with reluctance after much pressure from Pope Julius II -- between 1508 and 1512. He began work on the "Last Judgment" 23 years later, finishing it in 1541 after six years of work. Michelangelo's vision of the "Last Judgment," crowded with people rising ecstatically toward heaven and falling horror-stricken toward hell, is said to have deeply impressed his contemporaries and rather terrified Pope Paul III, who commissioned it.

As the master applied his water-based paint on the fresh plaster, he said: "He moved very rapidly, with very solid techniques. It's possible to see what he did in a day. Sometimes he used many very thin coats of paint, sometimes he applied very little pigment to make sure the light of the plaster would shine through."

And even if Michelangelo's "David" were not the star attraction at the Galleria dell'Accademia , his unfinished Slaves series would more than compensate.

nyt_corpus_1991.har/12/08/0492403.xml	        ONE of the most troubling aspects of the angrily debated, nearly decadelong project to restore the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel had to do not with Michelangelo but with Japanese television. The Vatican accepted an offer from the Nippon Television Network of Toyko to pay for the restoration and to record on film the work of the conservators. In return, Nippon was granted exclusive rights over Sistine Chapel photographs for several years, after which control reverts to the Vatican. The benefit of this arrangement was to produce what must be the most thorough documentation of any restoration of a work of art.
nyt_corpus_1991.har/12/08/0492403.xml	        But throughout the project, which was completed in 1989, Nippon made access to photographs difficult and expensive; the only volume produced by the company during the restoration did not contain the images necessary to address the concerns of the few, yet vocal, critics who fueled public doubts about whether the transformation of the frescoes on the ceiling from their famously darkened state into paintings of brilliant color betrayed Michelangelo's intentions. The Vatican and Nippon, by their actions, paradoxically helped sustain the debate over the restoration even after almost all the experts who studied the project had come down conclusively in support of the Vatican's own team of conservators.
nyt_corpus_1991.har/12/08/0492403.xml	        Nippon had previously produced German, Italian and Greek versions of "The Sistine Chapel." The French and English editions are the latest to be issued. Alfred A. Knopf is the publisher of the 2,500 copies to be sold in the United States, the text of which, unlike that of the French edition, features commentary on Takashi Okamura's photographs by Giancarlo Colalucci, the senior conservator on the restoration. Fabrizio Mancinelli, the official in charge of the project, recounts the history of the various restoration attempts on the ceiling, the first of which was undertaken only six years after Michelangelo completed his work in 1512. And the American art historian Frederick Hartt, who died recently, wrote the principal text on the frescoes.
nyt_corpus_1991.har/12/08/0492403.xml	        Even if Hartt's essay were not a clotted and tedious affair, "The Sistine Chapel" would be an outrage simply for its price tag. The widespread concern over the cleaning confirmed the enduring significance of Michelangelo's achievement to countless people around the world. There was something at the least ungenerous about the reluctance of the Vatican and Nippon Television to make photographs of the restoration as it proceeded more readily available. There is something immoral about finally publishing those photographs in a form accessible only to a few rich customers.
nyt_corpus_1991.har/12/08/0492403.xml	        Part, but not all, of the cost can be justified by the quality, size and number of the photographic reproductions, the extraordinary colors of which look true to the cleaned ceiling. The book may stint in areas like the shoddy bibliography, which lists only 15 works, one-third of them by Hartt, and it may not be as exquisite an object as one would expect a luxury book to be, but it is copiously and beautifully illustrated. For the chapter on the spandrel and pendentives over the entry door to the Sistine Chapel, with its scenes of Judith and Holofernes, David and Goliath and the Prophet Zechariah, to take a typical example, there are no fewer than 21 images: full-page and smaller-scale details, before- and after-cleaning comparisons, and foldouts in which every small crack in the plaster, every remnant of damage from salts and silicates, every stroke of Michelangelo's brush is fully on view. In the case of a double foldout like the detail of the image of God creating the sun and moon, the photograph is a foot and a half high and almost four feet wide.
nyt_corpus_1991.har/12/08/0492403.xml	        These photographs document Michelangelo's increasing mastery over the technique of fresco painting, the logic of his use of high-key color to sculpture the figures and to render them vivid to a viewer looking from the floor more than 60 feet below in a chapel that the artist presumed would be illuminated only by natural light and candlelight. They are confirmation that the restoration process was in the end a triumph.
nyt_corpus_1991.har/12/08/0492403.xml	        Mr. Colalucci's comments accompanying the photographs explain simply each step of that process, and Mr. Mancinelli's essay outlines in basic form the historical circumstances that resulted in the layers of glue and overpainting and dirt that for centuries masked Michelangelo's palette. These texts provide information of particular use to scholars and students, most of whom must await a more humanely priced volume of photographs of the ceiling.
nyt_corpus_1991.har/12/08/0492403.xml	        Having completed the ceiling, the Vatican's conservators have turned their attention to another, and in some ways more complex, project in the Sistine Chapel: the cleaning of Michelangelo's "Last Judgment." That huge fresco, on the wall behind the altar of the chapel, turns out to have been painted predominantly in a shade of blue that should make an even more startling impact than the colors of the ceiling when the restoration is completed several years from now. Nippon is again the sponsor, and presumably it aims to produce a volume on the project. One can only hope that a forthcoming book on the "Last Judgment," unlike "The Sistine Chapel," will not cost more than a round-trip ticket to Rome.

When a Renaissance painter is known to have been homosexual -- Caravaggio, Michelangelo -- along comes some straight historian like Bernard Berenson to show us, after the fact, that the pictures too are gay, usually by pointing out the pretty boys (never the tough soldiers that the historian may be less subliminally attracted to).

That bitter edge of memory framed the program, which began with the first New York performance of Aribert Reimann's "Tre Poemi di Michelangelo" and ended with the Shostakovich Trio in E minor (Op. 67).

Its vocal line is arresting. At times its contours call to mind Gregorian chant, but there are also moments of soaring, impassioned lyricism, irresistible vehemence and even a sense of terror of the unknown.

Any claims that the latrine is art are absurd because the piece does not fit into Mr. de Kooning's corpus, says the art critic Arthur C. Danto. Debunking the latrine as art in an article published in The Nation in March 1985, Mr. Danto compared the seat to the hypothetical drawing of two rolls, some fish, etc., sketched by Michelangelo to show a deaf and illiterate waiter what he would like to order. Both would be worth collecting as memorabilia, he argued, but not as art.

Nor will it help, in the long run, to use DOS to change the "DATE" stamp in the computer to fool the virus into skipping March 6. Older computers have two internal clocks, one in hardware and one in software, and the March 6 virus looks for the hardware clock. If you are running version 3.2 or earlier versions of DOS (type VER at the DOS prompt to see which version you have), the clock trick will not work. DOS version 3.3 gives full control of the internal clock but is not foolproof.

Here one sees the only instance in the show of Giacometti's familiar use of endlessly circling lines to create the human form. The way the faces are joined as if knitted is a perfect correlative to the enveloping intimacy Rembrandt was depicting, and shows how original Giacometti's copies could be.

The decision to strip the work of its thick layers of dirt and yellow varnish has been followed by constant argument, which recalls the fight over the cleaning of Michelangelo's murals in the Vatican.

In this country individual patronage has given us institutions ranging from the Boston Symphony Orchestra to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.

The idea of nature and the natural is the thematic focus here, with Neil Jenny's "Atmosphere," a painting of a cloudless sky, set between Richard Long's mound of white granite rocks and one of Joseph Beuys's blackboards covered with childlike chalk drawings. The implication of the organic and the primitive in these works is neatly subverted by Tony Cragg's "David," a collage version of Michelangelo's heroic sculpture made entirely of tiny white-painted plastic forms -- cigarette lighters, eyeglass frames, combs -- affixed to the wall.

Earlier, "genius" had meant spirit, the magical spirit of a jinni or more often the spirit of a nation. Duff and his contemporaries wished to identify genius with the godlike power of invention, of creation, of making what never was before, and to do so they had to create a psychology of imagination: imagination with a "rambling and volatile power"; imagination "perpetually attempting to soar" and "apt to deviate into the mazes of error."

nyt_corpus_1992.har/10/30/0566504.xml	        To be rich and successful in Italy 30 years ago was to be embarrassingly bourgeois. To be rich, successful and alienated was to be at the height of fashion. Think of "L'Avventura" (1961), "La Notte" (1962) and virtually everything Michelangelo Antonioni has made since. His films raise longueurs to an art form. They treat alienation with a kind of snobbish solemnity. It's as if alienation signified both good breeding and a good bank account. In the cinema of Antonioni, alienation is the 20th-century equivalent of what in the 19th century was called melancholia, something that only the rich could afford to catch, much less indulge. Fellini's work is something else. It's about the aristocracy of talent. It's as poetic as Antonioni's and far more skeptical.

Dallapiccola treats a more mundane scene -- quarreling spouses -- in his "Due Cori di Michelangelo Buonarroti il Givane."

One of the enduring pleasures of the Modern Library in its ever-mutable glory days was the appearance of books that briefly gained classic status by sole virtue of their inclusion. I recall with gratitude coming across books I might never have read if they hadn't received the Modern Library imprimatur, among them Arthur Morrison's "Tales of Mean Streets" and George R. Stewart's "Storm" and especially John A. Symonds's "Life of Michelangelo." If the Modern Library is to flourish again, as I hope it will, may it have the courage to look beyond the realm of Famous Authors and resuscitate some of those lost in the breach. By all means, give us Dostoyevsky (and keep the Boardman Robinson watercolors when getting around to "The Idiot"), but bring back Romain Rolland's novel "Jean-Christophe" and Edmund Wilson's invaluable anthology "The Shock of Recognition" (two mammoth works that fully justified the weight of Modern Library Giants), and say yes to another turn by those forgotten decadents Pierre Louys and James Huneker, whose music criticism ought also to be revived, and do please induct Constance Rourke and William Gaddis and Andrew Lytle and Chester Himes and. . . .

Whereas Trollope, in Eliot's words, excels in depicting "thoroughly natural everyday incidents," Dickens transcends reality and creates a world of his own. It's one thing to render things as they are, with talent and genius even; it's something more, however, to transform these things -- and people and situations -- into universals. Trollope belongs with Andrea del Sarto; Dickens with Michelangelo, who couldn't draw an arm accurately. Dickens also belongs with Rabelais, Moliere and Cervantes as one of the supreme comic geniuses in history. As for both popular and critical acclaim, Dickens, from "Pickwick Papers" on, has been read and applauded, like Shakespeare, without interruption -- granted that critical recognition and approval came later.

According to some self-serving antivirus software makers, the Michelangelo virus, so named because it was programmed to erase hard disk drives on the birthday anniversary of the artist, was so widespread that as many as a million computers were expected to crash on March 6.

A major Rogier van der Weyden that was temporarily in storage survived with only a few minor nicks. And unbelievably, not only are the Dossos fine, but none of the Titians or Raphaels or Veroneses or Caravaggios or the Michelangelo that hung in the rooms nearest the bomb were damaged.

A few rubberneckers are always to be found now milling around the museum. But a vast majority of tourists who pass through the crowded Piazza della Signoria, next to the Uffizi, seem to take no notice, smiling for snapshots, as tourists long have, in front of the replica of Michelangelo's "David" outside the Palazzo Vecchio (which also had windows broken by the explosion).

A Michelangelo drawing was sold in London on Tuesday for $6.32 million, the highest price ever paid for an Old Master drawing at auction.
nyt_corpus_1993.har/07/09/0620434.xml	        The Getty, with pockets deep enough to pay top prices, has been bolstering the Old Masters drawings market for years. "It was an amazing opportunity to buy a great drawing by a great artist," said George Goldner, the curator for paintings and drawings at the Getty. "We didn't have a Michelangelo drawing, and British museums have many. Barring a new discovery, it's doubtful that a work like this will come on the market again." Mr. Goldner added that the museum was "well satisfied with the price."

(The Getty traditionally makes arrangements with a dealer to bid for the institution.)
nyt_corpus_1993.har/07/11/0620851.xml	        All told, Mr. Carpenter's work is a monument to what may become a new discipline in musical studies: speculative erotic analysis, in which the terms "could mean," "as if" and "seems to be" are touchstones of methodology. Whatever its merits, Mr. Carpenter's approach does not help us appreciate the quality of Britten's music, or understand those aspects of his achievement that, in the opinion of many, render him worthy of being placed alongside Purcell and Elgar in the pantheon of British composers. Indeed, the meaning and individual quality of Britten's art "inhere within it": his mastery in balancing classical, romantic and modern elements; his powerful sense of dramatic pacing; his imaginative juxtaposition of esthetic sensibility and realism; his instrumental resourcefulness; his versatility in tone painting; his range of sympathy when setting the texts of Donne, Rimbaud, Holderlin, Michelangelo or Pushkin in their original languages; his ability to compose music for young people that is at once simple and sophisticated.

But Verrocchio's reputation was long ago wounded by, who else, a critic: Giorgio Vasari, writing in 1550, almost three-quarters of a century after the unveiling of "Christ and St. Thomas," described Verrocchio's art as "hard and crude, since it was the product of unremitting study rather than of any natural gift or facility."

That she put her art to the use of evil is an issue she never seriously addresses here. But can the self-deceptions of an obsessed esthete wipe out the fact of her greatness as an artist? A leading British film historian, John Grierson, publicly kissed her foot and paid her expenses in one of her libel suits. In the United States, frequent showings of her films, including a retrospective at the Telluride Festival in Colorado in 1974, did much to rehabilitate her as a genius. If there were still attacks accusing her not only of gleeful collaboration with the Nazis but also, among other things, of not influencing the course of cinema, the last charge, at least, is otiose. Successes generate demonstrable imitations; masterpieces subtly alter perception and create influences less easy to trace.

Moreover, as Ms. Turner notes, hell has what Hollywood might call an "entertainment quotient," even in some imaginative work a comic dimension.

Mr. Beck is the Columbia University art historian so outspoken in his opposition to certain high-profile restoration projects that he was threatened with jail in Italy for defaming a restorer. Whereas most discussions of art restoration are carried out in scholarly peri odicals, Mr. Beck has expressed his views in People magazine. His ceaseless and not altogether coherent attacks on the widely endorsed cleaning of Michelangelo's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican have earned him the enmity of powerful colleagues and made him something of an outcast.

His argument occasionally defies logic and history. He asks: If the brilliant colors of the cleaned ceiling are authentic, why didn't Michelangelo's contemporaries comment on them? But in daylight or candlelight, high above the heads of viewers, the colors would not have looked nearly as strident as they do in the artificial glare of modern spotlights. Nor would they have been out of keeping with the taste during the early 16th century for a high-key palette, a taste evident in other recently cleaned works, like "The Deposition" in Florence by Michelangelo's admirer Pontormo, or even Michelangelo's own "Doni Tondo" in the Uffizi.

He started out as a kind of modernist day-tripper. Early Japanese projects, like the City in the Air (1960-63) and the Oita Prefectural Library (1962-66), bear the influence of Le Corbusier, Louis I. Kahn and the British architectural group Archigram, as well of that of Kenzo Tange, Mr. Isozaki's early mentor in Tokyo. Later, as Mr. Isozaki's international career accelerated, his designs absorbed the classical high spots of the traditional European grand tour. The Tsukuba Center Building of 1979 to 1983, for example, visualizes the civic center for a new Japanese town as a stone collage of references to Michelangelo, Borromini and Ledoux.

nyt_corpus_1994.har/03/06/0672619.xml	        Art lovers can once again admire the works on display in the Michelangelo Room in the west wing of the Uffizi art gallery in Florence, one of the rooms badly damaged by a powerful car bomb that killed five people in May 1993. A highlight of the 400-year-old gallery, the room reopened two weeks ago. It contains paintings by Raphael and Fra Bartolomeo as well as Michelangelo's masterpiece the "Tondo Doni" medallion. Fra Bartolomeo's painting "Porzia," also damaged in the bombing and previously situated elsewhere in the museum, will be placed alongside its contemporaries once restoration work has been completed, before the end of this year, according to museum officials.

The remaining rooms on the upper floor of the west wing are expected to reopen by the end of this year; depending on the speed of structural repairs, however, it is possible they will not reopen until 1995, according to Anna Maria Petrioli Tofani, curator of the museum.

Maybe Henry Moore was right when he lamented, after none of the entries was chosen in a 1958 competition for a memorial at Auschwitz-Birkenau, that only "a new Michelangelo or a new Rodin" could conceive a memorial able to overcome all the philosophical obstacles in its way.

nyt_corpus_1994.har/03/20/0675447.xml	        Since then, Michelangelo's other great Sistine Chapel fresco, "The Last Judgment," on the west wall, has been masked in canvas, concealing a seven-story scaffold not unlike the one the artist used to create the work. Now, at an Easter week Mass to be celebrated by Pope John Paul II, "The Last Judgment," too, will be reoffered to the public in the same brightly colored state as the ceiling.
nyt_corpus_1994.har/03/20/0675447.xml	        Most scholars seem to support the Vatican's restoration, carried out by Gianluigi Colalucci, the chief restorer, and Fabrizio Mancinelli, chief art historian. But a passionate minority, led by the American James Beck, has challenged the restoration, saying it removes additions to the frescoes by Michelangelo himself and, to put the case at its bluntest, reduces his considered subtleties to primary-colored cartoons.
nyt_corpus_1994.har/03/20/0675447.xml	        Dr. Mancinelli said "The Last Judgment" differs from the ceiling in several respects. In between creating the two works, Michelangelo visited Venice and became familiar with Titian and his school. As a result, the colors in "The Last Judgment" look warmer than those on the ceiling, especially when seen close up from the scaffolding.
nyt_corpus_1994.har/03/20/0675447.xml	        In addition, Michelangelo's papal commission for "The Last Judgment"was structured differently. Before, the artist had to provide materials from his basic fee; for "The Last Judgment" he had a separate expense budget. As a result, he was able to use costly lapis lazuli blue for his sky. But that made restoration more difficult, since lapis lazuli particles are more easily removed by traditional cleaning techniques.
nyt_corpus_1994.har/03/20/0675447.xml	        In the end, the basic cleanser chosen by Mr. Colalucci and applied by him and his three assistants was a solution of three-quarters distilled water and one quarter ammonium carbonate. The solution was either sponged on or simply pressed on, using a special paper. In either case, the solution was allowed to penetrate the grime for only a limited time, usually 9 to 15 minutes, before being removed along with the dirt (and, the detractors worry, some of Michelangelo's final intentions).
nyt_corpus_1994.har/03/20/0675447.xml	        Sometimes the breechcloths were painted over Michelangelo's original, and have been removed. At other times the original was removed first, and is irretrievable. When restoring the original was possible, the decision was made to leave breechcloths that were themselves "historical documents." Dr. Mancinelli insisted that did not mean Catholic doctrine had overridden esthetic considerations. "Nobody told us we had to do anything," he said.

("Not sure if it's true," he said, "but it sounds good.") Bob Kravitz, a sports columnist for The Rocky Mountain News, takes a similar look at the Rockies in "Mile High Madness," his account of the expansion franchise's inaugural year, 1993. "Most of these men were camping on the fringes of a major league existence, older players running on the fumes of long-gone talent, or youngsters whose lack of experience would have earned them another couple of years in the minors back in the days before expansion," he writes. Mr. Kravitz tells how the team improved from its 19-41 start to become competitive by season's end; he argues that the marginal status of most of the players actually helped the young team. "There are no stars here," the Rockies catcher Joe Girardi told Mr. Kravitz. "Guys need to rely on one another. . . . There's the saying about the Boston Red Sox, '25 players, 25 cabs.' This team, nobody makes enough money, so they've got to share a cab." The author brings to life Don Baylor, the team's aggressive and outspoken manager, and Bob Gebhard, the general manager, whom Mr. Kravitz calls "the human equivalent of an unmade bed."

nyt_corpus_1994.har/04/16/0680802.xml	        The unveiling of the refurbished "Last Judgment" in the Sistine Chapel calls to mind the phony image of Michelangelo, the lonely genius trapped between agony and ecstasy, isolated on his back on a scaffold, paintbrush in hand. In fact, he was on everybody else's back.
nyt_corpus_1994.har/04/16/0680802.xml	        Like his modern counterparts, the entrepreneurial Michelangelo was versatile: he dreamed up a church facade, library and mausoleum, all in Florence, for the city and its wealthiest executives, the Medici.
nyt_corpus_1994.har/04/16/0680802.xml	        The romantic myth that Michelangelo worked by himself fits our notion of the lonely, self-sacrificing genius -- conditions that presumably are necessary for creating art. Actually, he was never alone. He lived with two male assistants and always had a female housekeeper. Thirteen people helped him paint the Sistine ceiling; about 20 helped carve the marble tombs in the Medici Chapel in Florence, with its allegories of Day and Night, Dawn and Dusk. And to build the Laurentian Library in Florence, he supervised a crew of at least 200.
nyt_corpus_1994.har/04/16/0680802.xml	        As a human resources officer, Michelangelo knew his personnel: Michele was unreliable and deceitful; Rubechio, a contemptible wretch; Bernardino, a rascal, great scoundrel, liar and thief; Pietro, a fop who loved fine clothes more than work and flitted about Rome, in his velvet shoes, chasing whores.
nyt_corpus_1994.har/04/16/0680802.xml	        Michelangelo's workers sometimes disappointed him but he never fired them. "One must have patience," he wrote. He paid his assistants well -- something like today's upscale plumbers and carpenters (but his salary was 12 times theirs). He provided housing for those with a long commute (most walked an hour or more to work) and despite the occasional outburst he was genuinely fond of them and vice-versa. He employed many for 10, 20, 30 or more years; this was remarkable, given the generally unreliable nature of labor and average life expectancy of about 40.
nyt_corpus_1994.har/04/16/0680802.xml	        His close ties with the staff in Florence insured labor stability and guaranteed quality control. But when Francesco da Sangallo turned out shoddy carving, Michelangelo docked his weekly pay "because he did not abide by what he promised."

nyt_corpus_1994.har/04/16/0680802.xml	        Although he had no training or experience in architecture, when Michelangelo started constructing the most magnificent and expensive building in Florence he used marble blocks of a size and quantity unequaled in more than 1,000 years, from Alpine quarries that even today are virtually inaccessible, with a transport system of sleds and oxen that had to be organized and staffed, with equipment that was made and borrowed and sometimes defective, in weather that was often uncooperative and roundly cursed and with men who were handpicked but needed job retraining.
nyt_corpus_1994.har/04/16/0680802.xml	        Yes, Michelangelo was a creative genius -- and a savvy executive, a man equally at home in the mundane and the sublime.

Since then, debate has raged about whether the emperor should remain in his glass cage, or be restored to the original base.

And there are many downright exhilarating rescues performed in this volume, produced with the Nippon Television Network, which underwrote the project to clean Michelangelo's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel and documented it on film. The color photographs in the book, by Takashi Okamura, are captivating, especially a double foldout spread depicting the entire ceiling. In fact, the title of the book is slightly misleading, since the book covers only the ceiling, having been prepared before work on "The Last Judgment" was completed this year. The book contains essays by 10 leading experts on Michelangelo and the restoration. They are not written for casual readers, but several will make the great frescoes, and all of Michelangelo's art, vastly richer for anyone with the determination to understand them -- especially Michael Hirst's treatise on the surviving drawings of bodies the artist made from life for the huge figures on the ceiling; Gianluigi Colalucci's beguiling and illuminating essay on how the frescoes were made; and Mr. Shearman's warm and opinionated chapter on the purposes of the colors. "The Sistine Chapel" is a book that can be read, in part or wholly, many times with increasing wonder. Now that the ceiling appears much as it did to its creator, I want to leap up into it, looking and feeling and sniffing, to roll around in it. I am glad to have the assurance of the angular Mr. Shearman that Michelangelo invited such robust reactions. What is obvious now, he says, is that this heaven of color was meant to give pleasure, "like that of a bouquet," and he adds that as the artist worked "the poet in him was released." That is one reality rescued from the grime.  D. J. R. BRUCKNER

The spanking white facades of San Andrea della Valle and the Church of the Gesu punctuate the gritty Corso Vittorio Emanuele, the busy street leading from the bridge over the Tiber to the Vatican.

nyt_corpus_1994.har/11/16/0725835.xml	        Even so, changes to the city's appearance, thanks to both public and private ventures, are abundant. Up the street from Sant'Ivo, at San Luigi dei Francesi, crowds gather to see the remarkable Caravaggios in the Contarelli chapel, but most of them miss the recently cleaned frescoes in the Polet chapel by Caravaggio's contemporary, Domenichino. At the Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, Michelangelo's "Christ Bearing the Cross" gets the attention, but a few feet away the frescoes in the Carafa chapel by the Florentine master Filippino Lippi look more luminous and sumptuous than they have in centuries after their restoration.
nyt_corpus_1994.har/11/16/0725835.xml	        It can also be revelatory. Consider "The Last Judgment." Not only can you see details once obscured beneath layers of grime, like the figures in the caves along the bottom of the fresco, the ghostly souls rising toward heaven, and the puffs of smoke and fire. You also finally understand the whole fresco as a single, even, unified composition, instead of the patchwork quilt it had seemed before. And your eye is now carried by the composition upward in a single great sweep from hell to heaven, as Michelangelo intended, with Christ the anchor at its center.
nyt_corpus_1994.har/11/16/0725835.xml	        As the ceiling proved, Michelangelo was a brilliant colorist. Vatican restorers warned that the bright blue background of "The Last Judgment" would look startling when the cleaning was done. But it actually looks less so than before, since the blue is no longer starkly contrasted with dark passages. One of the most sublime of all works of art has truly been reborn through the cleaning.

It is as much about Alexander Liberman, the artist and former editorial director of Conde Nast Publications, and the writer Joseph Brodsky as it is about Michelangelo or the Campidoglio. Mr. Brodsky's essay is a personal meditation on the author of the "Meditations," Marcus Aurelius. Michelangelo used the great antique equestrian monument of the Emperor for the centerpiece of the Roman piazza, called the Campidoglio, that he designed for Pope Paul III. The statue was removed in 1981, after Rome's pollution nearly destroyed it; now it is in the Capitoline Museum for safekeeping.

For centuries, artists provided forms for society's heroes (or for the heroes governments wanted society to have): statues of Greek athletes or the Marcus Aurelius in Rome; Michelangelo's David, which was understood by the Florentines to represent civic freedom. Photography, film, newsreels and television changed that, and artists now are reduced to playing with images already established in public fantasies, stoked by forces beyond the limits of art.

nyt_corpus_1994.har/12/25/0733212.xml	        The Unknown Stella -- As one walked through the Joseph Stella show last summer at the Whitney Museum of American Art, expecting little, the exhibition revealed an artist more compelling, original and plain weird than anyone might have guessed on the basis of his Brooklyn Bridge pictures. Stella's mix of Madonnas, flowers and Caribbean landscapes were the product of a ripe and iconoclastic imagination that found inspiration in everything from the Sienese Renaissance through Marcel Duchamp. Altogether, the sleeper of the year. Another Face of Picasso -- "Picasso and the Weeping Women: The Years of Marie-Therese and Dora Maar," at the Metropolitan Museum of Art over the summer, sounded as if it would be a mess but turned out to be a beautiful, quirky and inspiring near-mess. Even by Picasso's standards, the work was unusually personal and suggestive (of his gigantic psyche). Especially striking were the extraordinarily colored paintings from the 30's, which aren't usually thought of as his best years. Poussin as Poet -- In the last rooms in the Poussin retrospective now at the Grand Palais in Paris, as one was feeling respectful of the brainy 17th-century French master but not passionate about him, something finally clicked. It happened in front of Virgilian scenes of Arcadia like "Landscape With Diogenes" and awesome tempests like "Landscape With Pyramus and Thisbe" and in front of a touching self-portrait that reveals the artist as poet. The Great Unveiling -- Michelangelo's "Last Judgment" in the Sistine Chapel in Rome, the cleaning of which was completed last spring, finally revealed itself as a grand, unified composition instead of the patchwork quilt it had seemed before. Walking into the chapel, one is now struck by an image of brilliant color that sweeps the eye upward from hell to heaven, with the heroic figure of Christ as the anchor at the center.  THE YEAR IN THE ARTS: ART/1994
nyt_corpus_1995.har/01/01/0734450.xml	        After all, discarding art on a political basis lands us in dubious company of both left and right, from Josef Stalin to Joseph McCarthy. And while mores shift through age and place, true art defies time; centuries after the scandal wore off Michelangelo's homosexuality, the Sistine Chapel still takes the breath away.

"Because above all, the point of departure for this film is that it expresses the face. Someone once said that the art of cinema turns completely around the face. That's true. Only the human face is ultimately important."  FILM Peter Brunette is writing a book on the Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni.
nyt_corpus_1995.har/01/08/0735665.xml	        Beware architects bearing models: that's the unstated moral of the Renaissance show (through March 19). On the cover of the catalogue, a painting depicts Michelangelo presenting a scale model of St. Peter's to Pope Paul IV. The presentation is a tribute to God, and to the supreme power of the church. But it is also an act through which the architect enlarges his own cultural power.

After writing about monsters like the catlike dinofelis and Peter Benchley's white shark, he quotes a description of a creature with "cruel, penetrating" eyes that turns out to be one psychoanalyst's portrait of the superego. His account of life before electricity brings out curious details: "When Michelangelo painted the Sistine Chapel, lying on his back on a rickety scaffold, he designed a kind of headband with a stub of candle stuck in it in order to see what he was doing."
nyt_corpus_1995.har/01/11/0736321.xml	        It sounds, on the surface, as if it couldn't be more fair. Why shouldn't culture do what other things do, and take care of itself? The only problem is that it doesn't work, as history proves. Culture has never been able to support itself. There is a reason that the popes and the Medicis hired Michelangelo, that royalty paid Mozart to write concertos, that the histories of creativity and of patronage are intimately intertwined. The marketplace has never been a testing ground for artistic validity; history shows few correlations between what is popular enough to pay for itself and what is good enough to last.

Ten additional models will represent the Duomo in Florence, as well as later models that show the building's facade.

nyt_corpus_1995.har/02/07/0741987.xml	        I have never, in a career of looking at representations of architecture, felt awe before a model. It is usually the private property of the real thing, of true architectural experience. Yet awe is what one feels here before the 12-foot-high model of the Cathedral of Pavia, intricately designed and stunningly detailed, a triumph of craftsmanship in the way the details of Bramante, Cristoforo Rocchi and Giovan Pietro Fugazza are executed; before the astonishing model of St. Peter's dome by Michelangelo; and before the largest object in the show, the recently restored model of St. Peter's built between 1539 and 1546 to show the design for it by Antonio da Sangallo.
nyt_corpus_1995.har/02/07/0741987.xml	        Not that the Sangallo design was so great. Sangallo was Salieri to Michelangelo's Mozart, and his version of St. Peter's was busy, fussy and dull. We can only be grateful that most of his design was never built: the model is surely more interesting than his building ever would have been.
nyt_corpus_1995.har/02/07/0741987.xml	        These models were design tools for their makers, a means of persuading patrons to approve designs and of showing workmen what to do. For us they are still more: they are tools of information, helping us to understand the differences between Michelangelo and Sangallo, or between four different architects' proposals for the facade of the cathedral in Florence; they are also magnificent works of sculpture, art in their own right.
nyt_corpus_1995.har/02/07/0741987.xml	        The major works are installed in the west hall and west garden court of the gallery, just off the main rotunda, and they have been placed to take perfect advantage of Pope's formal axes. We see models from a distance, pulling us in, then we see them in another way, close up. The model of Michelangelo's dome for St. Peter's has been given pride of place at the very center of the garden court, while the most intimate models, the series involving the dome and various facade designs for the cathedral in Florence, have been placed in smaller side galleries.

Or even the Morgan's own spectacular Farnese Hours. Painted by Giulio Clovio in 1546, this book ends the show as it began nearly a half-century earlier, with scenes from the Bible, though Clovio's heated drama, Mannerist colors and nudes lifted from Michelangelo nearly explode the manuscript format.

But there were good visits, too, like the one to the East Village studio of the painter Nicole Eisenman, which he recalls as "looking like an explosion in a thrift shop. Her work is amazing.

"Zurbaran: Jacob and His 12 Sons" is a 175th anniversary exhibition, organized by Manuela Mena, deputy director of the Prado. The second Prado show is of work by the Renaissance painter Sebastiano del Piombo. A friend and follower of Michelangelo, Sebastiano softened the older artist's grand, muscular style with an atmospheric melancholy that may find its echo in Spanish artists like Velazquez and Zurbaran. Both exhibitions end on April 30. The London show, "Spanish Still Life: From Velazquez to Goya," open through May 21 and including works by the astonishing Juan Sanchez Cotan (1560-1627), a monk who lived in Toledo, should be stunning.

The building is of red brick with precast concrete details, loosely classical, with just enough ornamentation so that it might almost pass for a real building, not the concrete bunker that most malls resemble. The idea of using simplified classical details to soften a work of architecture may seem trite, and it is certainly not original.

Designed by Brunelleschi, the piazza is exquisitely Florentine, a study in endless shades of gray and cream and lined with three grand porticoes.

"Vive l'Amour," Tsai Ming-liang's haunting second feature, is a virtual homage to the Antonioni films "La Notte" and "Eclipse." As in those early-60's masterpieces, the gleaming anonymous architecture and thoroughfares of a booming metropolis (here it is contemporary Taipei) frame the blank spiritual lives of characters who drift through the city in a state of melancholy disconnection.

The Taft, at 777 Seventh Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets, built to cater to the Broadway tourist crowd, has seen more than its share of drama in its lifetime. Built as the Hotel Manger in 1926, it stood 20 stories, had 1,432 rooms and was Manhattan's third largest hotel. Right around the corner from the Roxy Theater, it was often host to big bands, including George Hall's orchestra on the rooftop and the Vincent Lopez band, which broadcast a weekly radio show out of the Taft Grill room for more than 25 years. It was also unfortunately popular with suicides, including a midnight jumper in 1954 who shocked a rapt crowd estimated at 5,000 people when she leaped to her death. Another potential jumper was coaxed to safety in 1957 by a passing priest. (The crowds, ever present, went wild.) The Taft hit hard times in the 70's and was gutted in 1985. It was remodeled and reopened as the Grand Bay Hotel in 1986. It is now the home to a new hotel, the Michelangelo. JESSE McKINLEY

Isabella, born to a powerful Ferrara family, was the wife of Francesco II Gonzaga, the fourth Marquis. It was she who amassed the great Gonzaga art collection. Though these small, connected chambers once contained works by Michelangelo, Mantegna and Perugino, only the immovable decorations now remain; between 1627 and 1630, the ill-famed Vicenzo sold off most of the paintings to Charles I, and they have remained in Britain to this day.

Renaissance Florence had more mediocrity than mastery; Tosini, Portelli da Loro and Foschi created inside its walls, but it is Michelangelo who is remembered.

In those images, all outside references -- even those of the mythic Leda and her Swan -- fade away and the piece becomes, momentarily and wonderfully, pure Martha Clarke: the performance suddenly assumes the pungency of her uninhibited brand of dance-theater. Outrageousness combines with poignancy, and bold insight is married to the beautiful visual image. The more distilled the movement, the more intense the emotional impact.

I believe our duty is to be like John Henry. He relied on himself, his own spirit, his own hand. He was a steel-driving man, driven from his craft by the terrible miracle  of technology. But he fought it.  He symbolizes the hand of man, the preservation of the imagination and the beautiful aspects of labor. If the field of art, empowered by technology, seems at times grainy, diluted, polluted or impersonal, one should take heart. For what I have found in my lifetime is that a John Henry always comes through: Jesus, Michelangelo, Picasso, Brancusi, Jackson Pollock, Bob Dylan, Kurt Cobain. There is always someone who will permeate a slack, complacent or convoluted surface; someone comes through. We are the conscience. When things look bleak or seem decadent and jaded, someone will come through. John Henry's fight was a little reminder of the power of the individual. I think it's important to remember this as we move further into a technological society.
nyt_corpus_1996.har/01/05/0820473.xml	        In Ms. Bourgeois's 1984 "Nature Study," for instance, the formal idea of a cube flanked by two spheres clearly preceded the artist's decision to polish the spheres while leaving most of the cube in a "raw" state. The sexual associations of the forms are thoroughly modern, but the contrast between polished and rough  surfaces recalls Michelangelo's unfinished "Slaves," struggling to escape from their marble blocks. The use of raw material, in this sense, is a longstanding convention of European sculpture and architecture.

"The more specific the interpretation suggested by a picture, the less happy I am with it," he told Peter Galassi, the chief photography curator at the Museum of  Modern Art, who wrote the essay accompanying the images. Most of the subjects of his photographs are as inscrutable as Michelangelo Antonioni's anomic characters, and one is tempted to slap them out of their deep sleep. But the thwarting of viewers' lazy expectations can in itself be engaging, and in many cases Mr. diCorcia's portraits capture one of the hardest subjective states to photograph: meditative thought.

But if they thought of it at all, it was as a throwback to turn-of-the-century taste. Never did anyone suggest that the statue, which is missing its arms and the lower portion of its legs, might be Manhattan's only sculpture by Michelangelo.
nyt_corpus_1996.har/01/23/0824864.xml	        "I've walked past the house on my way to the Institute of Fine Arts for the last 30 years," she said last week. But it wasn't until that night that she recognized the possible importance of the statue, which, she said, "reminded me  forcefully in its every detail of the earliest works of Michelangelo."
nyt_corpus_1996.har/01/23/0824864.xml	        She began by researching the history of the house as well as that of the sculpture. This disclosed that the sculpture had been attributed to Michelangelo at auction in London in 1902 by the Florentine collector Stefano Bardini. It went unsold at the auction and was returned to Rome, where White acquired it from a dealer who described it as an antiquity that had recently been dug up.
nyt_corpus_1996.har/01/23/0824864.xml	        On the evidence of the photograph in the 1902 auction catalogue, an Italian scholar, Alessandro Parronchi, attributed the statue to Michelangelo in 1968, but his view won no support.

nyt_corpus_1996.har/01/23/0824864.xml	        So does Nicholas Penny, chief curator for the Italian Renaissance at the National Gallery in London, who saw the statue several weeks ago.

nyt_corpus_1996.har/01/23/0824864.xml	        Dr. Penny said he believed that Dr. Brandt had been very cautious. "But you are not going to make any discoveries in this field," he said, "unless you have  the nerve to commit yourself, the courage to entertain the idea that it might be by Michelangelo, and eventually to say that you think it is by him. I am convinced that she is right. The more one looks at it, the more it grows on one, not only as a remarkable work of art but something that makes sense as a work by Michelangelo."
nyt_corpus_1996.har/01/23/0824864.xml	        The flickering curls of the hair, the forms and features of the face, the treatment of the body and the carving technique, she said, recall Michelangelo's earliest works in Bologna and look forward to the "Bacchus," which he made soon after in Rome.

In contrast, the other, larger pictures in the Conversion series (one is 10 feet high and 15 feet long) recall the ebb and flow of organic shapes in the recent paintings of Cy Twombly, of whom Mr. Schnabel is a vocal admirer.

"A maker's adaptability in mastering different genres," Mr. Taylor writes, "increases the likelihood that his work will continue to be remembered, even at times, in places and by persons hostile  or apathetic toward certain kinds of cultural work." He adds that complex artistic works, capable of supporting a variety of interpretations, are similarly more likely to survive the vicissitudes of history.
nyt_corpus_1996.har/04/05/0841512.xml	        Talent alone, however, is no guarantee of immortality. For Mr. Taylor, it is  no coincidence that famous artists frequently surface in clumps: Ovid, Horace and Virgil were literary contemporaries; Bosch, Botticelli, Leonardo, Durer, Michelangelo, Raphael and Titian were all painting between 1490 and 1505, and Shakespeare, Marlowe, Ben Jonson, Thomas Middleton, John Webster and John Ford were all born within a 20-year period. These gifted contemporaries not only had  one another to compete against, but they were also engaged in the collaborative enterprise of defining a new literary niche, an enterprise that spurred them to continuing experimentation and innovation.

Renaissance popes emphatically made that point: the scholarly Nicholas V hired Fra Angelico to create frescoes depicting the lives of St. Stephen and St. Lawrence; under Julius II, Michelangelo began work on the Sistine Chapel and Raphael started work on the Stanze. Even modern art has found a home in the Vatican, in a gallery of paintings deemed religiously significant. Much there is undistinguished, but work can be found by Matisse, Modigliani and  Munch, among others.

He spoke with his visions on equal terms, sat down with them and answered them back.

What seemed external reality  he called a cloud interposed between human beings and the spiritual world, which would otherwise be too bright to bear. He wanted us all to know this. At one point in his biography of Blake, Peter Ackroyd speaks of him as "keeping his own counsel," but, as the book shows, Blake didn't. It was his mission to recall us  from materialism to the freedom and joy of the imagination, and it was humanity's duty to listen to his prophecies.

Borrowing from Niles Eldredge's and Stephen Jay Gould's revisions of Darwin, Mr. Taylor explains that cultural evolution proceeds through "punctuated equilibrium." Strong, memorable cultural artifacts arise in contemporaneous clusters: Ovid, Horace, Virgil and Propertius, or Michelangelo, Raphael and Titian, or the playwrights of the English Renaissance.

Two tiny craggy landscapes displayed in a vitrine near the show's entrance (their nearly identical shapes attesting not only to human intervention but also to the strength of esthetic convention) might almost be small bronze studies by Rodin.  Elsewhere one thinks of Giacometti, Henry Moore, Dubuffet and de Kooning, whose  globby bronze figures are echoed with eerie accuracy by a rock titled "Rock in the Form of a Figure With Extended Arms."

Sure, and "The Agony and the Ecstasy" told you Meyer Schapiro's view of Michelangelo, too.

From classical antiquity right up to our century, painters and sculptors have rendered women without muscles. (Michelangelo was one of the few  exceptions.) Even Amazons, on the basis of their bodies alone, are indistinguishable from the goddesses of love; we recognize them by their short,  one-sided tunics. The men in art, in a tradition descended from the Greeks, wear their muscles like a suit of armor just beneath the skin; no insult, physical or otherwise, could penetrate their strength. Their bodies are faceted, the surface subdivided into planes, like a Cubist painting. The women, however, tend to be enveloped in a blanket of fat. The transition from their ankles to their calves, from their calves to their knees, is made smoothly, uninterrupted by bones and tendons. Their thighs are lush. Their breasts are like peaches.

"Vive l'Amour," Tsai Ming-liang's haunting second feature, is a virtual homage to the Antonioni films "La Notte" and "Eclipse."

Wrong.  Ms. Donald reveals that with the exception of William Hogarth, who really belongs to an earlier era, 18th-century English caricaturists were for sale to any political cause or candidate with the right price. This was true even of Rowlandson, whose draftsmanship was equal to that of Michelangelo. Surely the greatest artist ever to devote himself to comic art, Rowlandson too could be bought. He not only shifted his political loyalties back and forth but executed  cartoons on both sides of the same issue. Of the 50 or so prints he etched before the election of 1784, half were in favor of William Pitt, the King's chief minister, and half supported Charles James Fox, leader of the opposition.  Four years later, when the two parties were divided on the question of regency,  Rowlandson blithely took assignments from print sellers on both sides of the question.

His personal life was tumultuous: he was an inveterate gambler, he always drank heavily and he flaunted his homosexuality. But his provocative way of life seemed to inspire him to create. He was an avowed atheist, yet he returned frequently to the theme of crucifixion, always calling his works "studies," as if one day he planned to  paint a complete crucifixion. The howling mouths or silent screams that characterized much of his work through the 1950's soon appeared, with a series of isolated heads giving way to his many studies inspired by Velazquez's majestic portrait of Pope Innocent X. In this series and in his studies for a portrait of van Gogh, his tributes to the artists were direct. Elsewhere, he quoted more subtly from Monet, Michelangelo, Turner and Degas.

Mr. Poeschke emphasizes the serendipity of Michelangelo's era, the great luck that patrons, popes and artists could all agree that "the human figure was the most perfect image of the divine in the earthly realm." It was an era ideal for sculpture; cities like Florence and Rome ordered colossal, freestanding works for the first time since  antiquity. Mr. Poeschke, an art historian who teaches at the University of Dusseldorf, chronicles the triumph of this medium with a comprehensive set of 399 photographs, 52 of them in color. He includes all of the major sculptural achievements of this period; many are shown in various angles and with specific  details enlarged. The final portion of the book describes the artwork, piece by  piece. Mr. Poeschke often chides art historians for engaging in overinterpretation; he very sensibly refuses to believe that much of this artwork is meant to convey esoteric messages to a privileged few. This final section would serve as an excellent textbook; however, few readers will need or  desire such minutiae.

Art historians hope the recovery of the frescoes will help reestablish the reputation of Signorelli, a painter admired by Michelangelo. Indeed, Michelangelo paid him the highest form of flattery by emulating his work in his own ''Last Judgment'' in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel.

Such damage masked the contours and bold colors of a work that had so amazed Michelangelo that he ''kindly borrowed some of Luca's inventions, such as angels, demons, the order of the heavens, and other details'' when he painted the Sistine ''Last Judgment'' roughly a half-century later, according to Vasari, the 16th-century biographer.

Restorers here nonetheless had to contend with the legacy of misguided previous restorers. In the 19th century, for example, Russian conservators from St. Petersburg  scrubbed Signorelli's work so thoroughly that many of his final touches -- additions painted on after the original fresco had dried -- were scraped off.

Today, however, the conflict between elite self-expression and pop fare looks increasingly like a put-up job by critics short of attention. One hundred years from now, such high-low distinctions will be virtually forgotten: what is great art, whether Michelangelo's frescoes for the Sistine Chapel or Cole Porter's song ''Night and Day,'' but art whose excitement time can sometimes sanitize but never destroy, art that has kept its sex appeal? In 2096, Wole Soyinka's memoir of his early life in Nigeria, ''Ake: The Years of Childhood,'' for example, and Michael Herr's dazzlingly dark account of Vietnam, ''Dispatches,'' will find readers among the fans of Stephen King's ''Shining'' and ''Misery,'' while Martin Scorsese's films of urban life and Lee Tamahori's shattering portrait of Maori life in Auckland, New Zealand, ''Once Were Warriors,'' will share Web space with the works of Carl Dreyer and Cezanne.

Most storied of these is the Villa San Michele, once a 15th-century Franciscan monastery with a facade designed by Michelangelo. This Italian National Trust monument, surrounded by a designated forest preserve, has been transformed into a luxurious, other-worldly hotel, a favorite of business tycoons and celebrities ranging from Zubin Mehta to Brigitte Bardot.

Mind you, not any old dresses, but dresses worn by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Sophia Loren and Sharon Stone. A printed explanation puts things even further into perspective: ''The color red -- symbol of beauty, passion and seduction -- becomes a link between the world of Valentino and the art of Michelangelo.''

It was designed according to classical principles: the same golden sunlight so beloved by Hudson River School painters casts its glow on the terrazzo floor modeled on Michelangelo's Piazza Campidoglio in Rome. The light shines through the octagonal timber-ceiling Victorian gallery, where Cropsey's oil paintings hang, then clambers up an oak staircase to alight on a gilded bronze sculpture of Cropsey at the top. Mr. Polites said that one of the goals of the building, which also features furniture designed with David Linley, Princess Margaret's son, was to ''reintroduce into the architectural landscape something that has been lost.'' Classical buildings, he said, ''are in the front of a cultural shift. It's about going back to inspirational things.''

His serene female goddess heads of marble or carved wood from this period, with sculptured piles of coiffure, have a 20th-century presence despite their look of antiquity. This has to do, of course, with the exaggeratedly rounded volumes and simplified forms Nadelman absorbed from French modernism, but also with his witty willingness to play against the past. In the white marble ''Female Head'' of 1908, for instance, the idealized subject wears a modish turban and an expression of sweet amusement, an archaic Greek smile turned sexy.

nyt_corpus_1996.har/11/10/0888708.xml	        It is 41 years since Sir John Pope-Hennessy, in the first of what would become a three-volume study, set out to persuade scholars to pay as much attention to Italian sculpture as they did to painting. That volume covered the Gothic period. Three years later, in 1958, came the second, on the 15th-century Renaissance, and in 1963 the third, on sculptors from Michelangelo to Bernini. He certainly succeeded: by now a second generation of scholars has followed his call and our understanding of this art changes almost daily. So this great book has had to change as well. As early as 1970 Pope-Hennessy began extensive revisions that continued through three editions. And when he died in October 1994, he had just completed work on the fourth edition of what he still modestly called AN INTRODUCTION TO ITALIAN SCULPTURE (Phaidon, three volumes, slip-cased, $345). The publisher has redesigned it, supplying hundreds of new spectacular black-and-white photographs and integrating them more closely with the text than they ever have been. Not that any illustration could be as eloquent as Pope-Hennessy. He is so restrained and so precise that the power of his emotions catches a reader by surprise. No book on art is more intelligent, more learned and unpretentious, or more infused with passion; it is a tremendously exciting education in art, history, society, the advancement of thought and craft -- in a word, in civilization. And few art books are as engagingly personal. Reading it is like listening to a good friend, who happens to be the most sensitive student of Italian art in this century, share his deepest responses to these glorious works and their creators. At times this can be overwhelming. It is hard to imagine an attentive reader who could get through the section on Donatello, for instance, without having to walk away from it now and then to regain composure.

Gombrich has taken issue with the theoreticians who, according to him, now want to equate roadside billboards and children's drawings with Michelangelo's sculptures. The canon may shift a little, he writes, but ''what you are not able to do, in my view, if you want to go on practicing the humanities, is to throw away all standards of value. Dehumanizing the humanities can only lead to their extinction.'' Actually, no one wants to do away with values; the debate is really about substituting ''correct'' values for the established ones. Gombrich, in sounding a cry for traditional humanistic principles, comes down on the unfashionable side of the argument.

It draws from the Uffizi's own collection and from churches, museums and collections in Italy and abroad to focus on 16th century Florentine art, particularly Il Rosso and Pontormo. Sculpture, drawings and prints and objects -- such as Michelangelo's wooden model for the facade of the church of San Lorenzo in Florence -- create intriguing juxtapositions with the paintings. Raphael's grand ''Portrait of Leo X as Cardinal'' is accompanied by two of the prelate's illuminated manuscripts and a tapestry he gave to San Lorenzo. Near the end of the show is a group of vibrant Pontormo paintings including the haunting ''Holy Family with St. John'' from the Hermitage in St. Petersburg. Portrayed in a vermilion dress and black-green cloak, the elegant, pensive Madonna alone merits a trip to Florence.

And no one cast a longer shadow over the early work on view here than Michelangelo. One need only look at the pen-and-ink ''Flaying of Marsyas,'' by Paolo Farinati (1524-1606), to see it: the hapless satyr's extended, pumped-up arm is lifted straight from the muscle-bound nudes of the Sistine ceiling. Sometimes, though, inspiration lay closer to home. Leandro Bassano (1557-1622) was an artist-offspring of the formidable Jacopo Bassano, and, though no genius, he did honor to his familial pedigree. His softly smudged charcoal drawing of a crouching man, a little whirlwind of curves on blue paper, is lovely.

In Fellini's ''Dolce Vita'' and ''8 1/2'' and in Michelangelo Antonioni's bleak ''La Notte,'' he portrayed individuals searching for the keys to their lives.

The role calls for cool decadence with a shade of sadism, which is certainly Mr. Malkovich's cup of poisoned tea. And the film, in its curious somnambulist style, does put Isabel and Osmond through the precise paces James described, as he plays to her rebellious horror of the genteel life.

Did this harsh change in Botticelli's art come about because of religious beliefs, some private despair or simply life? Was he reacting to new styles (Michelangelo was already working on his ''David'' in 1501) or trying to satisfy clients? Botticelli might have painted ''Lucretia'' to celebrate a marriage between two families of anti-Medicean republicans; its visual allegories are disputed.

We have progressed far beyond the Greeks and Romans in many things, spiritual and material. We no longer have chattel slaves, and are trying to stop treating women as slaves.

After laying the surface, the artist applies a subject to the wall by rubbing charcoal powder over a perforated full-size sketch of the area to be painted.

Van der Goes was plagued by ''melancholy'' for most of his life and this was his last painting before he retreated to the monastery where he died. According to Francisco de Hollanda (in ''Da Pintura Antiga''), Michelangelo said of these painters that whereas the work of their Italian counterparts would never cause a viewer to shed a tear, the paintings of ''Flanders will cause him to shed many.''

The suspension of the commission meant Rodin could spend the rest of his life making the piece to his own satisfaction as a personal monument. He saw the artist's life as one of torment and always identified with Michelangelo; he saw himself as his heir and understood that genius was destined for unhappiness. His literary inspiration for ''The Gates'' was Dante, mostly, but more immediate was the inspiration of Baudelaire, whose poem ''Les Fleurs du Mal'' presented 19th-century Paris as Hell.
nyt_corpus_1997.har/03/14/0915376.xml	        Last fall, that infatuation spawned the first Biennale di Firenze, subtitled ''Looking at Fashion.'' The Florence show seems to have been a three-ring circus of six or seven exhibitions -- including ones devoted to Bruce Weber's photographs and Elton John's costumes -- plus 18 installations by big-name fashion designers who were set loose in some of the city's most venerable museums and buildings. (Valentino, for example, surrounded Michelangelo's ''David'' with five mannequins in red dresses.) ''Art/Fashion'' is a condensed version of what was probably the most restrained and thoughtful segment of the Florentine extravaganza. In its first half, it surveys the interaction between art and fashion down through the 20th century, although it has (understandably) a bit of an Italian bias, and is hardly exhaustive.

A much younger son, fathered when Platter was 75, died in the early 17th century, the age of Cardinal Richelieu and the Three Musketeers. Three generations of Platters -- the father, a son and the younger son -- straddle three centuries; their correspondence and memoirs add life and color to Renaissance and Reformation.

nyt_corpus_1997.har/04/18/0923576.xml	        MICHELANGELO BUONARROTI (1475-1564) and Auguste Rodin (1840-1917), two of the most sacred cows of European sculpture, are starring for the first time together, in ''Rodin and Michelangelo: A Study in Artistic Inspiration,'' at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Although there are those who feel that the Florentine and the Frenchman ought not to be mentioned in the same breath, the two have a lot in common aside from their fame, particularly their mutual admiration for Michelangelo's art.
nyt_corpus_1997.har/04/18/0923576.xml	        To be sure, Michelangelo has not been universally applauded. Brancusi, once an assistant to Rodin, described Michelangelo's sculpture -- in Rodin's favor -- as ''nothing but muscle, beefsteak, beefsteak run amok.'' Rodin, on the other hand, could occasionally be corny. (Michelangelo, never!)
nyt_corpus_1997.har/04/18/0923576.xml	        But from his early years as an artist, Rodin had an ambitious interest in Michelangelo. Aside from marveling at his technical prowess in conveying the torques and tensions of the figure, Rodin was gripped by Michelangelo's spiritual intensity, and he believed that his expressive art stood for the essence of the Italian people. In his own work and persona, Rodin aspired to represent the national genius of France. And when he visited Florence for the first time in 1876 and saw what Michelangelo had wrought, Rodin was dazzled, cramming notebooks with sketches of his hero's work.
nyt_corpus_1997.har/04/18/0923576.xml	        The ''Rodin and Michelangelo'' show, a paean to this one-sided collaboration, is itself a cooperative venture between the Philadelphia Museum and the Casa Buonarroti, the Michelangelo museum and study center in Florence. It was organized by Maria Mimita Lamberti of Statale University in Milan and Christopher Riopelle, associate curator of European painting at the museum.
nyt_corpus_1997.har/04/18/0923576.xml	        As for the show itself, its thesis -- as expressed in its admirable catalogue, a model of clarity and concision fittingly presented in handbook size -- is that Rodin was no slavish acolyte of Michelangelo. He constantly tested himself against the master, and became his own man by translating the grand-scale eloquence of Michelangelo into modern, more human terms that had a strong effect on the course of 19th- and 20th-century sculpture.
nyt_corpus_1997.har/04/18/0923576.xml	        An indirect example of such refocusing is seen in Rodin's most famous work, ''The Thinker'' (1880), shown here in a modest-size version of its many castings. On his passionate pilgrimage to Florence, Rodin was especially taken by the imposing Medici Chapel, and Michelangelo's brooding tomb figure of Lorenzo de Medici was one of his sources for ''The Thinker.'' (Another was Michelangelo's painted head of Jeremiah for the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.)
nyt_corpus_1997.har/04/18/0923576.xml	        The show presents a full-scale mockup of the tomb in plaster with Lorenzo in a niche above his sepulcher, hand on chin, elbow to thigh, contemplating the two massive allegorical figures ''Dawn'' and ''Evening'' (also reproduced in plaster), sprawled on top of it. In ''The Thinker,'' whose subject, hand on chin, elbow on thigh, leans forward in intense concentration, Rodin turns Michelangelo's faith-anchored statement about life confronting mortality into a more uncertain meditation that seems to express the angst of the modern world.
nyt_corpus_1997.har/04/18/0923576.xml	        An even more direct appropriation from Michelangelo is Rodin's ''Age of Bronze'' (1875-76), a male nude with one hand placed atop his head, the other raised at an angle with bent elbow as though carrying a spear (Rodin's original intention). His earliest surviving life-size sculpture, it was done from a live model. But a look at the exquisite Michelangelo drawing ''Male Nude From the Back,'' (circa 1504-1505) immediately reveals Rodin's source for the rippling musculature of the bronze physique.
nyt_corpus_1997.har/04/18/0923576.xml	        The sculpture also evokes a Michelangelo marble, ''The Dying Slave'' of 1514-1516 (not in this show), a life-size depiction of a bound man in his last hours. Although the pose and trancelike demeanor of Rodin's figure is very similar, it has much less the air of a martyred captive than that of a contemporary man in a state of cosmic groping.
nyt_corpus_1997.har/04/18/0923576.xml	        Alas, the actual Michelangelo material here, mostly lent by the Casa Buonarroti, is restricted to drawings and a few minuscule sculptures attributed to the artist, like the tiny yet powerful terra cotta ''Male Torso'' (1530-1540). But several of the drawings here are among his greatest, including ''The Virgin and Child'' (circa 1525), being shown for the first time in the United States, and ''Studies for the Libyan Sybil'' (circa 1511), lent by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
nyt_corpus_1997.har/04/18/0923576.xml	        And there is no dearth of Rodin. Besides the pieces already mentioned, and a number of drawings that evoke Michelangelo, there are such famous life-size-or-larger chestnuts as ''St. John the Baptist Preaching'' (1878), ''Adam'' (1880), ''Eve'' (1881) -- Rodin at his corniest -- and ''The Three Shades'' (circa 1886).
nyt_corpus_1997.har/04/18/0923576.xml	        Without Michelangelo, would there be a lesser Rodin? The show does not address this, but it brings powerfully home the dialogue between past and present that plays a dynamic role in art.

A columnist for Out magazine, Mr. Signorile was an aggressive advocate for an unashamed gay male culture -- in 1990 he pioneered the outing of closeted homosexuals -- but he had a kind of epiphany concerning its features of sexual abandon after an H.I.V.-hazardous sexual encounter.

Speaking of Durer's famous print ''Melencolia I,'' which is prominently displayed at the Metropolitan, young Holmes said: ''In the anatomy of that figure there is the mass and grandeur of Michelangelo's 'Night.' But it is hidden under the curiously crumpling folds of the enveloping garment, elaborated with a touch of German realism. This corresponds to, and illustrates, the peculiar power of the artist. It is, like that form, massive and imposing. But, again like it, it hides its naked strength under the thousand folds of a disguising fancy.''

Among such astronomical numbers the 15,000 illustrations, mostly black and white, seem skimpy, but the point of the dictionary is to purvey information through words, and, after all, what number of illustrations would ever have been adequate to document the entire history of art?

Writing on art is generally so awful these days that it is remarkable there are so many authorities whose prose could be made accessible. And if the dictionary doesn't tell you something, at least it tells you where to find it, in 300,000 bibliographical citations. This is crucial because encyclopedias are initial sources of information but they're never definitive, even at 26 million words. The accomplishment of Grove is to have provided a library of reference material with many points of entry into various subjects: sections like Decadence and Decline, or Music and Art, or even Building Regulations, open up the study of art to paths of inquiry that standard biographical or geographical entries don't, and I found those sections among the most memorable precisely because they're unconventional, hence thought-provoking.

Holmes shows how the veneration of classical architecture and sculpture led to a new realism in painting and literature; how even an attempt to copy classical handwriting could contribute to the individualism we associate with the Renaissance; and how separate innovations in Florence, Venice, Bruges and Ghent touched and eventually joined to change the perceptions of the European mind, ''like a dye coming from one source being diffused through a lake.'' Holmes's fine selection of color reproductions in Renaissance (St. Martin's, $35) makes plain why so many of the period's finest works of art -- bold and often startling even today -- could not have been possible except ''where thinkers and artists were protected from the tyranny of ecclesiastical intolerance and princely despotism.'' He is especially good at conveying what is mysterious and cannot be explained in many Renaissance paintings and sculptures, and he makes somehow coherent, if not fully definable, the greatness of painters like Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael. His story concludes with Cervantes, Shakespeare and Rembrandt, who marked the fulfillment of Renaissance achievement just as the influence of the cities that fostered it was being lost to the growing power of monarchies that resulted from population growth and shifts in the trade routes. ''Through a long struggle of historical recovery and artistic inspiration,'' Holmes writes, ''the European mind has been reborn.''

In this summer's great treat of a sleeper, stripping and out-of-work, out-of-shape British steelworkers make for a funny and illuminating mix. In the process of perfecting their dance act (to the thump of a wonderfully incongruous disco beat), these lovable lugs learn a thing or two about masculinity. Brightly acted and casually hilarious, the film exploits this gimmick in witty, trenchant ways that are always generous, never cruel. Mr. Cattaneo's winning feature debut understands that joblessness is a humiliation well beyond nakedness, but it also revels in the sight of downtrodden ex-workers learning to enjoy their new freedom. This comedy is cheerfully raunchy but doesn't embarrass its cast with frontal nudity. Scrappy Mr. Carlyle,  of ''Trainspotting,'' emerges as a star (Maslin).  * ''THE ICE STORM,'' starring Kevin Kline, Joan Allen and Sigourney Weaver. Directed by Ang Lee (R, 112 minutes). The elegant and deeply disquieting story of two suburban families whose lives change irrevocably during the title event, which takes on mystical force not often seen in films about wayward weather. Adapting Rick Moody's observant novel, the director of ''Sense and Sensibility'' uses his own quiet acuity to make a Connecticut bedroom community, circa 1973, seem as strange and distant as any Austeniana; no, much more so. Beautifully and mournfully acted, especially by those who play the women of this well-heeled Pompeii. The vulgar excesses of the time period and the delicacy of Mr. Lee's direction form a haunting combination (Maslin).

An artist's posthumous reputation is a result of endless vagaries and sea changes. It is worth remembering that no less an artist than Michelangelo once fell out of fashion, even as he continued to be recognized as a figure of historical importance. This is the difference between taste and historical relevance, the two being commonly confused. It is amusing when people talk about the canon of Western art as if it were eternal, and something to be breached by anti-traditionalists only with difficulty, like a fortress. In truth, the canon is more like a mall. People come and go all the time. Even Bach had to be rescued from relative neglect by Mendelssohn. Guido Reni was once as exalted as Raphael. Vermeer was completely forgotten for centuries, like Piero della Francesca and Georges de La Tour, whose current canonical stature is partly a reflection of what we think looks modern.

It's apparent in another painting, of a bather, also from the 1860's: an ample woman, seated, twisted, like one of Michelangelo's nudes, eyes closed, face shrouded. An undercoating of red paint seeps through to the surface so that the figure glows. Her huge body fills the canvas, a massive form, though her outline is drawn in a way that simultaneously flattens her. She relates to the ''Young Bather'' in the Met's collection, of a big woman dipping a foot daintily in the water: yet another carnal picture by Courbet, full of ambiguities of scale. But the bather in this show has a mysteriousness all its own, anticipating Symbolism.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/02/06/0993360.xml	        ''Eric Fischl meets Rodin with a bow to Michelangelo'' could be the subtitle of this first solo venture into sculpture by an artist known for his figural scenarios on canvas. It must be admitted that there is a little more naughtiness in this show than in the work of the French and Italian masters, including crotch-clutching and genital play, but the overall impulse comes directly from Rodin's forms and modeling, if not his solid craftsmanship.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/02/06/0993360.xml	        But the work is also about ''supplication and selflessness,'' the artist says, ''an image of hysteria'' and ''the language of profound grief bordering on madness.'' It also seems ''terribly erotic,'' he says. ''I think the viewer will first see an image of eroticism and lovemaking and then also be reminded of Michelangelo's 'Pieta.'''

An exceptional show, featuring mostly landscapes that challenge the standard view of later Courbet, meaning the Courbet of the 1860's and 70's, as a painter of diminished quality. The best work here has a sensuous concentration that seems almost akin to love -- it's what Kenneth Clark once described as Courbet's ''colossal appetite for the substantial'' (Kimmelman).  ARTHUR DOVE, Terry Dintenfass, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 581-2268 (through Feb. 28). A modest but worthwhile adjunct to the Dove retrospective at the Whitney Museum. By contrast to his more heavily worked oil paintings, the almost postcard-size watercolors in this show have a breezy, playful quality that makes one think of Paul Klee (Ken Johnson).  ERIC FISCHL, Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313 (through Feb. 28). This sculptural venture by an artist known for his figural scenarios on canvas is a deep homage to Rodin and Michelangelo. The work has many of the poses and attitudes of these Old Masters, but lacks their craftsmanship and deep insight into the emotional expressions of the body. In short, it comes out as posturing cliches (Glueck).  * DONALD LIPSKI, ''The Yearling,'' Doris C. Freedman Plaza, Fifth Avenue at 60th Street, sponsored by the Public Art Fund, (212) 980-4575 (through May 31). A child's red chair, made of steel, with a spotted toy pony placed on its seat, is Mr. Lipski's zany contribution to the Central Park site. The unexpectedness of the piece, its cockeyed disparities in scale -- the chair is 20 feet high, the pony 10 feet -- and its placement, across the street from the solemn Grand Army Plaza with its Saint-Gaudens statue of General Sherman on a horse, help make it one of the city's more arresting pieces of public art (Glueck).  WAYNE F. MILLER, Keith de Lellis Gallery, 47 East 68th Street, (212) 327-1482 (through March 14). Pictures made in Chicago in 1946 and 47 by a photographer who has worked for Ebony, Life, Fortune and other magazines; he also assisted Edward Steichen in preparing ''The Family of Man.'' Called ''Way of Life of the Northern Negro,'' this absorbing photo-essay ranges from images of Duke Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald performing, to a sandlot baseball scene, to a tender close-up of a couple making love (Johnson).  FULVIO TESTA, Denise Cade Gallery, 1045 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, (212) 734-3670 (through Feb. 28). These small, understated watercolors might not look like much at first, but they grow on you. Using muted colors and a brushy, wet-into-wet technique, Mr. Testa creates airy, evocatively abstracted landscapes with a Chinese feel (Johnson).  HELEN TORR, James Graham & Sons, 1014 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, (212) 535-5767 (through Feb. 21). Better known as the wife of Arthur Dove, now the subject of a retrospective at the Whitney Museum, than as a painter in her own right, Ms. Torr deserves a niche of her own in American modernism. The best of her still lifes and landscapes from the 20's and 30's combine color and line, abstraction and natural forms, with great verve. The show includes works from her estate not seen before (Glueck).

Center stage is an early Tintoretto, influenced by Michelangelo, that shows the Madonna, Child and saints engaged in an animated conference (note the complicated hardware of St. Catherine's death-dealing wheel), while Salvator Rosa's ''Death of Socrates,'' all finicky ivory-yellow drapery folds, vibrates nervously off to the side.

Organized by Vince Aletti, the photography critic for The Village Voice, the show offers some interesting thematic threads. Exoticism is one, from a 19th-century studio portrait of a Burmese fisherman, his near-nude figure covered with tattoos, to Marcus Leatherdale's 1997 shot of an Indian wrestler. Classicism in its many forms is another, from Baron von Gloeden's flower-wreathed Sicilian boys, circa 1900, to John Dugdale's  recent, witty ''Self-Portrait as David,'' in which the top half is the artist himself, the bottom Michelangelo's statue.

nyt_corpus_1998.har/03/01/0998736.xml	        Goffen argues that Titian is even sexier than people have thought, but also more respectable. She says that he may have used prostitutes as his models but that his nudes represent respectable women, not courtesans. Though Goffen draws on the insights of feminist criticism, she is refreshingly free from the determination to see nothing but patriarchal oppression in the past. In fact, she finds in Titian a deep regard for women, an empathy with them. She argues from Michelangelo's dismissal of Venetian colorism as ''a woman's art.'' As if taking up this challenge, Titian answered Michelangelo's treatment of the Leda myth -- all coupling muscle and feathers -- by giving his Danae the same pose as Michelangelo's Leda, but letting the god's gold flow over a languorous and receiving body. Titian was unashamed of his identification with feminine ''softness'' and grace.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/03/08/1000387.xml	        In ''Sexual Personae,'' Camille Paglia argues that Michelangelo's ''Dying Slave'' looks not so much moribund as post-orgasmic. It is, she says, a ''pagan crucifixion.'' Monica takes a further step, focusing on the figure of Christ deposed, Christ in that difficult interval between cross and burial. She studies the paintings of the great artists and notices the coy crossed ankles, the voluptuous gleam of light on ribs elegantly speared. She discerns an exhaustion that does not correspond to death so much as to postcoital languor. (If she had half an eye, she would ask herself whether it is in Pieta figures that Christ is most sexualized; but this would not fit the plot.) Monica begins a series of paintings called ''Spent Men,'' which will reinterpret masterpieces of Renaissance art. She decides to use her lover as a life model for the exhausted God.

By then it was 5:30, and I raced to the information desk looking for closing times, only to see a sign announcing which galleries were closed that day (for staffing reasons). Michelangelo's was among them.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/03/13/1001692.xml	        Giambologna's real name was Jean Boulogne and his background was Flemish-French. He acquired his Italianized moniker, Giovanni Bologna, by settling, around 1555, in Florence, where he also acquired Grand Duke Francesco de'Medici as a patron. A great admirer of Michelangelo (1475-1564), the young Giambologna once paid the old man a visit, only -- the story goes -- to see him flatten a small wax model of a sculpture Giambologna showed him and quickly rework it into something stronger, remarking that it should have been properly modeled before it was finished.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/03/13/1001692.xml	        As the most important sculptor in Florence during the last third of the 16th century, Giambologna -- the heiress Doris Duke dubbed him ''Johnny Sausage,'' according to Mr. Hall -- has a place in art history somewhere between Michelangelo and Bernini.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/03/13/1001692.xml	        Giambologna liked to work small as well as large, and he made numerous statuettes that were distributed as gifts to European royalty. Of particular brilliance are three tiny portrait busts: of himself, looking important in bronze; of his patron, Francesco de'Medici, who is far less imposing in colored terra cotta, and of Michelangelo, also terra cotta, in old age, his boxer's nose (broken by a fellow artist) and thinning hair rendered so ''hands on'' that Giambologna's fingerprints are said to be all over it. The flying figure of Mercury intrigued Giambologna, and over the years he did a number of small statuettes for patrons, as well as larger figures. Of the several shown here, the most beautiful is ''Mercury in Flight,'' dating from the 1570's. The concept of a figure in flight had been pretty much restricted to two-dimensional art, and Giambologna's unsupported Mercury figures were a breakthrough.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/03/13/1001700.xml	        Russell's farewell motif turned out to be, appropriately, a work of sculpture: Michelangelo's forlorn yet powerful ''Dying Slave.'' As this exhibition demonstrates, he drew it with obsessive regularity, repeatedly dissecting its exaggerated contrapposto in graphite, charcoal and finally gouache. Occasionally, he branched off to consider other sculptures, like Michelangelo's reclining (and twisting) sculpture of ''Day'' atop the Medici tomb. But the ''Dying Slave'' dominates, seen from different viewpoints, reduced increasingly to opposing curved lines, or shown with lines marking off the shifting angles of its body like so many arrows, creating the wedge shapes and emphasizing the central S-curve that would be the basis of his first abstractions.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/03/13/1001700.xml	        It is touching, if also a bit excruciating, to watch Russell extract what he needed from Michelangelo, and then meticulously plot, in further studies, the details of abstract composition, color shifts and shading, and even the instances of hard or feathered edges. But his persistence pays off, and when color is added, his work finally comes alive. Especially in the smaller version of ''Synchromy in Blue-Violet,'' which is more of a masterpiece than its larger cousin, Russell's wedges of bright color -- blue and green, red and yellow always carefully paired -- demonstrate that abstract space can be as dynamic as the more descriptive kind. These shapes fan out tautly, moving confidently up and back, and in and out of shadow, with a precision and vitality that only looks effortless.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/03/19/1003176.xml	        Artists, in the meantime, have mounted their own assault on the old standards of decor and decorum. Consider James Rosenquist's ''Swimmer in the Econo-mist'' (1997), a three-part painting that stands 11 1/2 feet high and stretches on for 158 feet -- long enough to provide a stylish backdrop for 27 leather couches placed end to end, with potted plants in between. Not that bigness is a modern invention. The Sistine ceiling proved that Michelangelo could turn out painting by the yard. Yet, Renaissance artists celebrated the oversize lives of Biblical personalities; today, size has become its own religion.

The first American show of the work of an important Florentine Mannerist sculptor, Giovanni Bologna (1529-1608), known as Giambologna. The show, from the collection of the New York art dealer Michael Hall, displays portable works by Giambologna and his followers, including figure and animal studies, religious pieces, relief plaques and models of large-scale public commissions. Among the treasures are tiny busts of the artist, his patron the Grand Duke Francesco de'Medici and Michelangelo. Several small statues of women stand out, among them the lovely ''Kneeling Venus,'' probably from the mid-1550's, whose pear-shaped posterior is a sensual celebration. A group of exquisitely modeled figures of Jesus, meant for mounting on crucifixes, is one of the show's most impressive presentations (Glueck).  * DONALD LIPSKI, ''The Yearling,'' Doris C.

After World War I, Struss enjoyed a long, distinguished career as a Hollywood cinematographer, but before that he made romantically blurry, Pictorialist photographs of New York in which you feel the tension between timeless reverie and modern urgencies that would soon render Pictorialism obsolete. This beautiful exhibition presents a set of 33 small platinum prints that he assembled into an album for a woman named Amy Whittemore in 1911 (Ken Johnson).

Situated in the heart of monumental ancient Rome on the edge of the Colle Oppio park, it has features that set it apart from the ordinary trattoria: consistently good home cooking, outdoor tables with a view of the Colosseum and the Piranesi-esque Baths of Trajan as well as superb service, provided by the brothers Eugenio and Enrico De Santis, the owners. And the only waiter, Franco, is one of the coolest in Rome. The restaurant itself consists of two cozy (read densely packed) rooms, the larger of which is dominated by a very appealing antipasto buffet. The lunchtime clientele is the result of geography, consisting about equally of professors from the neighboring University of Rome engineering school and tourists who have just seen Michelangelo's Moses next door.

JEAN FAUTRIER, ''Black Nudes and Other Early Works,'' Michael Werner, 21 East 67th Street, (212) 988-1623 (through April 11). This French artist is best known for the densely worked canvases he did after World War II that buried images in the materiality of paint. In the 1920's canvases and a few sculptures shown here, he coaxes still lifes, nudes and portraits out of indeterminate space by suave handling of color and modeling. They are more easily readable, yet they anticipate the layered-over images of his later work. He reinvigorates that old phrase, a painter's painter (Glueck).  ''GIAMBOLOGNA: SCULPTURE BY THE MASTER AND HIS FOLLOWERS,'' Salander-O'Reilly Galleries, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 879-6606 (through April 4).

Trying to break away from the cliches of European modernism, Adolph Gottlieb (1903-1973) worked out a format of freely associated images he called ''pictographs.'' Drawing on a wide range of sources, from tribal images to psychoanalytic theory, he used a vocabulary of invented archetypal symbols -- eyes, fish, birds, arrows, snaky lines and body references, among others -- that he used in gridded formats. These works, covering the years 1941 to 1953, owe something to the artists Joaquin Torres-Garcia and Picasso, among others. But often enough they have their own strength, although, like good puzzles, they reveal themselves slowly (Glueck).

Mr. Johnson was one of a few artists in the 1950's who tried to reconcile the formal demands of modernist abstraction and the psychological urgencies of figurative representation. His brushy, archetypal people are still alive and well, but their hectic urbanity has given way to pastoral relaxation in summer scenes set in France (at Rickards) and America (at Cade).

In a painting career of more than 50 years, Hedda Sterne, one of the first-generation members of the New York School, has explored modes from semi-realism to geometric abstraction.

Handsome and intense yet imperturbable, Alain Delon has attracted international audiences through 40 years and 75 films for an array of directors who include Michelangelo Antonioni, Jean-Luc Godard, Jean-Pierre Melville and Joseph Losey. Some Delon films, like ''Rocco and His Brothers,'' ''The Leopard'' and ''Borsalino,'' are widely known; others less so in the United States. Beginning today, the Museum of Modern Art is presenting ''The Unknown Alain Delon,'' a nine-film series devoted to the actor's relatively unsung works.  The opening attraction, at 2:30 P.M. today and 5 tomorrow, co-stars Mr. Delon with Jean Gabin in Henri Verneuil's crime caper ''Any Number Can Win'' (1963). Tonight at 6 and on Sunday at 5 P.M., Mr. Delon -- as director, star and co-writer -- is represented by ''Pour la Peau d'un Flic'' (1981), about a cop turned private eye who undertakes a routine investigation that becomes deadly. Continuing through May 11, the series at the museum, 11 West 53d Street, Manhattan, is free with museum admission: $9.50 for adults, $6.50 for students and people 65 or older; free for visitors under 16 accompanied by an adult. Pay what you wish on Fridays from 4:30 to 8:30 P.M. Screening information: (212) 708-9400 (Lawrence Van Gelder).

Whether Homo erectus, a significant transition species between primitive and more recent human ancestors, could speak is problematic. The earliest unequivocal evidence for human speech is the cave art and other artifacts of modern Homo sapiens, beginning some 40,000 years ago.

Remember the days of Michelangelo Antonioni's ''Blow-Up,'' Arthur Penn's ''Bonnie and Clyde,'' Dennis Hopper's ''Easy Rider'' and Mike Nichols's ''Graduate''? So does the Museum of Modern Art, which is why it is tapping its 14,000-film archive to celebrate the remarkable creativity of filmmaking of the late 1960's. Beginning Sunday, with a screening at 2 P.M. of ''Easy Rider'' (1969), the museum will present a series comprising more than 90 feature films, non-narrative works and short avant-garde subjects in a display of the highlights of this period. Though the series emphasizes the artistic and political ferment of the United States at a time when people like Woody Allen, Martin Scorsese, Mel Brooks and George Romero were directing their first features, it also embraces works by such eminent foreign filmmakers as Jean-Luc Godard, Jiri Menzel, Jerzy Skolimowski, Ingmar Bergman and Nagisa Oshima. Continuing through July 7, the series at the museum, 11 West 53d Street, Manhattan, is free with museum admission: $9.50 for adults, $6.50 for students and the elderly; free for visitors under 16 accompanied by an adult.

He is synonymous with chiaroscuro, bold contrast of dark and light, and in his characteristic paintings strongly lit, highly realistic passages blaze out of dark backgrounds. This meant heightened drama and emotion, which fit his subject matter, taken from sources as various as the Bible, mythology and the street.

nyt_corpus_1998.har/06/05/1022153.xml	        By almost any standards, there's plenty that can be called weird and retrograde about Burne-Jones's art: its fervent historicism, its relentless busyness, its frequent sentimentality. He borrowed from nearly every major Early and High Renaissance artist, from Giotto to Michelangelo and, later in life, Titian. Burne-Jones was ''an art historian's artist,'' as the catalogue puts it.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/06/05/1022153.xml	        This work, like so many here, reflects Burne-Jones's ability not merely to borrow from the past, but to mix and remix his sources with astounding fluidity. For example, he blended classical and Christian themes by adorning the story of Pygmalion with the garments and architecture of the Renaissance. In ''The Finding of Medusa,'' an imposing body-color study for his unrealized cycle of paintings based on the story of Perseus, the recipe combines Michelangelo with Henry Fuseli to dramatic, almost surreal effect.

But what seems actually to have happened is this: Artemisia, one of the first female artists to pursue a career on the same terms as her male colleagues, was taught by her father, Orazio Gentileschi (1563-1639), a well-known painter who worked in a simple but elegant Tuscan style influenced by his close friend Michelangelo Caravaggio.

nyt_corpus_1998.har/06/21/1025980.xml	        For four years, Michelangelo mounted a curved, stepped scaffold of his own design in the Vatican and went to work on the ceiling 50 feet above the floor of the Sistine Chapel. It was not his favorite thing to do. ''My brush is above my head and drips paint on my face,'' he wrote. ''I am bent like a bow and my back aches. Dear friend, rescue me now. I am not in a good place. And I am no painter.''
nyt_corpus_1998.har/06/21/1025980.xml	        Paint he did, of course, driven as if he had no choice in the matter by the Medicis and Pope Julius II, who signed him to a contract for the Sistine project in 1508. But as is made clear in ''Michelangelo, Restored,'' Perry Wolff's documentary about the 13-year cleaning and repair of Michelangelo's Sistine ceiling and ''Last Judgment'' on the west wall of the chapel, the artist would have preferred sculpture.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/06/21/1025980.xml	        In a sense Michelangelo emerges restored himself. ''He was a Christian in religion and a pagan in art,'' Mr. Wolff said in an interview. Originally hired to produce a fresco of the Twelve Apostles, Michelangelo instead turned out a vast account of the Old Testament, with frequent allusions to other facets of the ancient world. After the removal of centuries of soot, varnish and paint from the ceiling's surface, the Oracle of Delphi takes her place with God, Adam and Eve.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/06/21/1025980.xml	        In fresco (fresh), paint is applied to wet plaster, and the two dry together. With the painting sealed within, fresco becomes a stable and durable medium. Applying one coat over another, Michelangelo created glowing transparencies that mixed color and light to become drama. Everywhere are signs of his own struggle with his carnality on the one hand and his devout obeisance to church doctrine on the other.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/06/21/1025980.xml	        ''He loved his God more than he loved his lust,'' Mr. Wolff says in his film. Michelangelo, he relates, believed he was going to hell for his homosexuality. Sin was to be punished, as is made plain in the face of the dynamic Jehovah as he extends life through afingertip to the youthful Adam, whose gaze goes straight past his creator to fix on the beautiful Eve in God's left arm.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/06/21/1025980.xml	        Still, eccentricities and profundity could not be contained in his painting. ''He studied Protestantism and wrote sonnets,'' Mr. Wolff said. ''He mixed his own paints, knew science.'' Wiry and hot-tempered, his nose permanently squashed in a fistfight, Michelangelo exercised, abstained from sex, ate sparingly (especially while working) and painted in the same clothes until they fell off him.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/06/21/1025980.xml	        As an assistant spread wet plaster on ceiling and wall, Michelangelo painted along behind him. Each day, he calculated just how much he could complete before the plaster dried. Spread across the ceiling in 50 vignettes, the Old Testament becomes the precursor of the Jesuitical ''Last Judgment,'' completed between 1534 and 1541 on the west wall, with its terrible tale of apocalypse and retribution.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/06/21/1025980.xml	        The ceiling reflects a mastery of the Hebrew lore, down to the rich yellow of the robes. Here and there are signs of the artist's own emotions: a pair of hands twisted in anger, Mr. Wolff says, represents Michelangelo's feelings toward the Pope, who criticized his work, whacked him with a stick and withheld payments.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/06/21/1025980.xml	        In those times, the Popes were controlled by the Medicis, whom Michelangelo, depending on which of them he had to deal with, respected, feared or revolted against. During the Counter-Reformation, he joined the Republican cause against the Medicis, dropped art for civil engineering and, when the Republicans lost, hid in fear for his life in, of all places, the basement of the Medici chapel in Florence. All was forgiven, he was told, as long as he got back to work in the chapel.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/06/21/1025980.xml	        In addition to soil and varnish on the surface of the frescos, restorers in the 1980's had to contend with moisture that was threatening to loosen the paint from the ceiling and walls. What's more, earlier restorers had painted on top of the original figures in an effort to salvage or perhaps make improvements. During the latest restoration, experts removed the alterations, but also lifted small amounts of Michelangelo's pigment in the process. In an ensuing furor, as the film shows, their methods were called into question.

In the mammoth rendering, hundreds of figures are caught in all degrees of anguish on their way to the kingdoms of heaven and hell.

But at some point in the middle of the 1540's Michelangelo began carving what many art historians regard as his most mature and provocative sculpture, the piece now known as the Florentine Pieta.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/06/30/1028440.xml	        The sculpture was enormous -- nearly eight feet tall -- and Michelangelo's friend and best-known biographer, Georgio Vasari, wrote that the artist worked on it only at night. It was an intensely personal effort. The largest of the four figures, Nicodemus, is a heartbreaking self portrait of a suffering old man. To see what he was doing, the artist fashioned for himself a sort of 16th-century miner's lamp -- a paper hat with a notch cut into it to hold a burning candle.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/06/30/1028440.xml	        Nobody who saw it had any other opinion. Michelangelo intended the statue for the top of his own tomb. But one day, without a word of explanation and after a decade of brutal labor and emotional pain, the artist took a sledgehammer to it. He broke away hands and arms and legs and nearly destroyed the work before one of his most devoted servants dragged him away. Eventually it was patched together by one of his less talented assistants.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/06/30/1028440.xml	        The usual answers -- that Michelangelo was a perfectionist, that he was enraged by discovering flaws in the marble, that he was angered by a mistake in his composition -- do not really satisfy anybody. So at the request of Dr. Wasserman, who is preparing a lengthy book on the Pieta to be published this year by Princeton University Press, a team from the visual- and geometric-computing department at the I.B.M. T. J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., decided to get involved.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/06/30/1028440.xml	        ''There are many problems here that I realized I would never solve by normal means,'' Dr. Wasserman said. ''I wanted to be able to move the statue, to take it apart, to see it the way it was when Michelangelo broke it up. How was I ever going to accomplish any of that?'' In addition, Dr. Wasserman said he wanted to be able to look at the statue's individual parts and understand what it looked like before the broken pieces were put back on.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/06/30/1028440.xml	        Dr. Wasserman has a different goal. He wants to understand the statue -- and to be able to see it from every possible angle. Once the I.B.M.  team finishes its work, it should be possible to look at it with the arms and legs missing and perhaps see what Michelangelo was up to. It will be possible to look at the monument as if it were on top of an altar or tomb, as the artist had intended. Most important, it will be easy to manipulate the model of the massive block of stone -- and to vary the light conditions under which it is seen.
nyt_corpus_1998.har/06/30/1028440.xml	        Every statue is a unique collection of shapes, but this Pieta is particularly complex. A computer model might let a viewer get a glimpse inside the head of the artist. One of Christ's legs is still missing. It has been suggested that the only place it could have fit in the composition is draped over the Virgin. And that might have pushed Michelangelo beyond what he and his church regarded as the bounds of decency. With the I.B.M. model, it will not be difficult to add a virtual leg or to see what sort of statue would have come from it had Michelangelo done so.

Restorers in previous centuries who saw the darkened Sistine Chapel ceiling were convinced that Michelangelo was a painter of shadows, so they added their own dark touches to his work, reinforcing a view of him that affected future restorers, and so the cycle proceeded. When an artist named Mazzuoli stuck darkening glue to the Sistine ceiling in the early 18th century, he was just reflecting the beliefs of his day, as restorers today, having cleaned away the grime, reflect the modern faith in science, technology and historical revivalism. A century from now, the ceiling will probably look as much like a work of late-20th-century restoration as the darkened ceiling looked like an anachronism.

While some mineral waters are thought to improve circulation or treat liver maladies, the most common health claim is for kidney disease -- historically the chief reason to drink mineral waters.

Americans may be turning back to natural medicine in large numbers, but American doctors are not sending kidney-stone patients to spas courtesy of the local H.M.O. Dr. Gary Curhan, a kidney specialist in Boston, told me that he knows of no evidence that one water can encourage the elimination of kidney stones more than another.

Works by Caravaggio, Charles Ray and Michelangelo might be squeezed into a lecture on homoeroticism.

When Freud wrote about Michelangelo's Moses, for example, he treated it as ''3-D literature,'' analyzing what Moses's hand gestures meant, where in the biblical story they pointed, rather than admiring the chisled forms.

True, the Medici princes bankrolled Renaissance art for personal and communal pleasure. After reviewing family expenditures for public art and charities by his progenitors, Lorenzo the Magnificent accounted for a sum of 663,755 gold florins spent between 1434 and 1471 and commented: ''Nor would I complain about this, for though a man would like to have even part of that sum in his purse, I think it gave great luster to the state, and this money seems to be well spent, and I am satisfied.''

nyt_corpus_1998.har/12/06/1067343.xml	        Almost from his birth in 1598, Gianlorenzo Bernini was groomed to be the Michelangelo of his age. A child prodigy whose facility in carving pushed marble to extremes of mimicry never seen before or since, he served as artist-in-chief to the Roman Catholic Church for most of his 82 years. At the height of his career, his artistic power was virtually absolute, and he transformed the face of Rome as surely as any emperor ever did. It was a great achievement, but his reputation began to crumble even before his death in 1680. In part this was inevitable, given Bernini's domination of papal patronage and the enmities it engendered. Beyond that, Bernini always recognized that his artistic genius was sustained by an idiosyncratic combination of religious fervor and sensual imagery, so characteristic of what we call Baroque art, but scandalous to many even in his own lifetime.

nyt_corpus_1999.har/01/14/1077109.xml	        The project's goal is to create three-dimensional images of all of Michelangelo's statues for academic use, although David F. Salisbury, a Stanford University spokesman, said there could also be commercial applications for the scanning technology. The team has a special scanner that uses a video camera and laser beams to capture and digitize the images. The scanner, including the gantry on which it sits, is 20 feet high, a size designed to permit it to scan ''David,'' by Michelangelo.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/01/15/1077254.xml	        The show, in fact, is really almost as much about Dosso's milieu as it is about him, with a big essay in the catalogue by Andrea Bayer, who organized the exhibition at the Met, describing the court in detail. Alfonso d'Este, she reminds us, commissioned Titian and Bellini and tried to hire Michelangelo and Raphael. Ludovico Ariosto, who wrote the greatest epic poem of the 16th century, ''Orlando Furioso,'' was his court poet.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/01/15/1077254.xml	        As Alfonso's court painter, Dosso was therefore in prime position to know the best art of the day. He absorbed what was going on in Rome and Venice and to the north in Germany, so that his work, over time, took into account Giorgione, Titian, Raphael, Michelangelo, Giulio Romano, Durer, even a visionary painter like Altdorfer. You can clearly see, from gallery to gallery, how his style changes and solidifies under the pressure of different influences.

There's no other reasonable explanation for their dumpy appearance in light of works like ''Jupiter, Mercury and Virtue,'' which makes clear that for the right occasion Dosso could paint heroic male nudes exquisitely. He may never have been a truly sublime or even a consistent technician, but he was more than adept when he chose to be.

nyt_corpus_1999.har/01/17/1077750.xml	        TONY PARILLO learned who Michelangelo Buonarroti and Leonardo da Vinci were before he learned about George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. This early exposure to the great artists had a lasting impact on Mr. Parillo, creating in him a lifelong love for the art and culture of the Renaissance.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/01/17/1077750.xml	        A former corporate graphic artist and now an art teacher at Archbishop Stepinac High School in White Plains, Mr. Parillo recently wrote and illustrated a children's picture book titled ''Michelangelo's Surprise'' (Farrar Straus Giroux). The book, marketed for children between 4 through 8, is based on an anecdote Mr. Parillo found in several Michelangelo biographies. There had been a rare snowfall in Florence. The artist, then 19, was summoned to the palace. For what purpose? At the book's end, the reader learns it was to make a sculpture of a snowman. Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with Mr. Parillo, a resident of Somers, who is pursuing a master's degree in art education at the College of New Rochelle:
nyt_corpus_1999.har/01/17/1077750.xml	        Q. What prompted you to do a book about Michelangelo?
nyt_corpus_1999.har/01/17/1077750.xml	        A. I've been interested in him as an artist and in the time period he lived in my entire life, really. My dad, who was a commercial artist and obviously an Italian, taught me who Michelangelo and Da Vinci were when I was really a little kid. I knew who they were before I knew who Washington and Lincoln were. So I was always interested in them. In the course of reading about the time period, at one point or another years ago I came across this anecdote in biographies about Michelangelo.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/01/17/1077750.xml	        What they say is, It snowed very heavily one night, which was not a common thing for Florence. Michelangelo was 19 years old, and he had been living in the palace when Lorenzo de' Medici was still alive. Lorenzo de' Medici had been his patron. But after Lorenzo died, Michelangelo moved back to his father's house. This snowfall happened a year or two afterward, and Lorenzo's son, Piero, wanted to have a snowman built in the courtyard as entertainment. So he remembered this kid from when his father was alive and had him brought to the town and had him make this snowman in the courtyard.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/01/17/1077750.xml	        Q. Is the snowman you depict based on what Michelangelo actually sculptured?
nyt_corpus_1999.har/01/17/1077750.xml	        A. No. In my initial draft of the book, I used as its basis a small, eight-inch clay statue of a project that he would have been working on at that time. But in editing the book we decided that statue wasn't right. It was a standing sculpture and it was too high off the ground and Michelangelo wouldn't have been able to reach it the way I drew it. So I changed it to a sitting statue, and I took the liberty of inserting the face of God the Creator from the Sistine Ceiling. It's a book about Michelangelo. It's a book to introduce children to his work, and that would be a way to slip a reference in.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/01/17/1077750.xml	        Q. Through this book you are trying to acquaint American children with Michelangelo?
nyt_corpus_1999.har/01/17/1077750.xml	        A. Right. But it's not just Michelangelo, it's that time period. It would be fun to think of kids looking at the pictures in the book and wondering: Why are people dressed this way? Why do the houses look like this? Why are those paintings there? Also, it's a way to introduce them to the idea of history in general, that when people lived at a different time period things were different.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/01/17/1077750.xml	        Q. Who do you think is a greater artist, Michelangelo or Leonardo?
nyt_corpus_1999.har/01/17/1077750.xml	        A. That was a time period that was particularly rich for artists. I think it's really difficult to make a choice as to who is greater. I think Michelangelo's influence in the long run was probably greater because he completed a lot more work and what he did with a figure turned out to be a lot more innovative. His manner of treating the figure is something that influenced artists after him. But Da Vinci is probably just as great and, not being an art historian, I'm probably not qualified to judge who is better.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/01/17/1077750.xml	        A. Well, the products of his diversity are a lot more well known. But Michelangelo was a military engineer for a while as well. There was a siege in Florence later on in his life, and it was after he painted the Sistine Chapel. They called on him to be a military engineer and help in the city's defense. All artists at that time did everything. They just didn't sculpt. They had to design pageants; they would design everything from costumes to toys. There is a story of Da Vinci designing a mechanical lion to entertain the court that would walk and would open its mouth. And instead of sound coming out there were a bunch of lilies that came out of the mouth of the lion. This whole thing with the snowman with Michelangelo's part and Da Vinci being more than just a painter, this is representative of the age.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/01/17/1077750.xml	        A. I think they would have used it quite a bit. Michelangelo burned all his drawings when he finished whatever project he was working on. Those were his working notes.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/01/17/1077750.xml	        Q. Do you think if we met someone like Michelangelo today we'd appreciate him?
nyt_corpus_1999.har/01/17/1077750.xml	        Q. Do you get the feeling that Michelangelo and Da Vinci could have been anything they wanted to be?
nyt_corpus_1999.har/01/17/1077750.xml	        A. I think so. And Leonardo was known as a musician, too, and an engineer. And Michelangelo wrote poetry and was an architect. In those days to be an architect was to be a builder. People are more specialized today. Whatever talent you have you have to focus it on a single thing.

In an age of celebrity and hyperbole, he remained one of those rare performers whose achievements matched the hype. He took Bill Russell's definition of sport -- ''a mixture of art and war'' -- to a new level, and in the process he became the most recognizable person in the world, ''the flying man,'' as one Chinese newspaper called him, the man who defied the laws of physics and redefined his sport.

There the Council of Trent drafted its strategy for countering the Protestant challenge. It also discussed long-neglected matters of internal Church reform. One of the subjects of the council was the use of images in religious art. The Tridentine document stipulated that ''in the use of sacred images, all superstition shall be removed, all filthy quest for gain eliminated, and all lasciviousness avoided.'' In 1564, the year after the council concluded, Pope Pius IV ordered Daniele da Volterra to paint braghe or loincloths over some of the racier nudes in Michelangelo's ''Last Judgment'' in the Sistine Chapel.

''Wary that the self-evident achievements of black athletes cast an imposing shadow over many black youths and pull them away from careers in other fields,'' Halberstam writes, Edwards ''nonetheless talked about Jordan representing the highest level of human achievement, on the order of Gandhi, Einstein or Michelangelo. If, he added, he were in charge of introducing an alien being 'to the epitome of human potential, creativity, perseverance and spirit, I would introduce that alien life to Michael Jordan.' ''

Egyptian rulers sometimes had the faces of their predecessors wiped out and replaced with their own. Some religions prohibit any human imagery.

In mid-19th-century France, it was illegal to caricature anyone publicly without first obtaining his (or just conceivably her) permission.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/02/07/1083157.xml	        Besides, there is the artists' difference in stature. Dosso's contemporaries spoke of him in the same breath with Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Titian, but they can hardly have failed to see that Dosso's poetic originality was that of a follower rather than a founder. Monteverdi, on the other hand, marked a new beginning, in theory and practice.

nyt_corpus_1999.har/03/14/1092077.xml	        Prof Patricia Fortini Brown reviews book Three Worlds of Michelangelo by James H Beck (M)
nyt_corpus_1999.har/03/14/1092077.xml	        THREE WORLDS OF MICHELANGELO
nyt_corpus_1999.har/03/14/1092077.xml	        Many college freshmen who walk into an art history class will not have heard of Raphael and Titian. But they will know Michelangelo. Yet for all our appreciation of his art, we understand little about the man. This is the task James H. Beck sets for himself in ''Three Worlds of Michelangelo'': ''to penetrate Michelangelo's core of creativity and reach the quality that lies behind both his life and his work -- his humanity.'' Grasping the concrete particulars of this humanity proves a daunting task despite a mountain of archival evidence that includes over 500 letters written by the artist. The problem is to wrest thoughts and feelings from dry documents and to chisel out the hard facts from the mythology.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/03/14/1092077.xml	        The mythology began early. Michelangelo fashioned his own mythic image as primary informant for the adulatory biographies written by Giorgio Vasari and Michelangelo's pupil Ascanio Condivi in the 1550's. Both contended that Michelangelo's mission was divinely foreordained: that the artist descended from the ''noble and illustrious'' Counts of Canossa; that his horoscope foretold success in ''those arts which delight the senses''; that his wet nurse was the daughter of one stonemason and wife of another; that his artistic talent was discovered by Lorenzo the Magnificent, who took him into his house and treated him like a son; that Pope Julius II bullied him into painting the Sistine Chapel ceiling even though ''he had not yet used colors before.'' Using these accounts as a point of departure, Beck defines three worlds, each dominated by a male figure -- the artist's father, Lodovico Buonarotti, Lorenzo de' Medici and Pope Julius II -- that formed the matrix of the young Michelangelo's psychological, intellectual and artistic development. He weaves a smoothly flowing, seductive narrative, supplying dialogue through an inventive use of Tuscan proverbs and filling voids in the record with common-sense argument.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/03/14/1092077.xml	        But a good narrative is not to be confused with good history, and the reader should be on the alert when confronting the many ''must have's,'' ''may have's,'' ''could have's,'' ''might have's'' and ''would have's'' that allow suppositions to be woven into the gossamer tissue of facts. Thus Beck asserts that Lorenzo de' Medici intervened in Buonarotti family affairs, and not only ''would have encouraged'' Michelangelo's reluctant father to allow the 13-year-old youth to pursue a career in art but also negotiated his apprenticeship contract with the painter Domenico Ghirlandaio. This claim, which goes well beyond Vasari and Condivi, is not, to my knowledge, confirmed by any contemporary document. Situating Michelangelo a few years later as a long-term guest in the Medici palace, Beck vividly evokes a sumptuous interior decor that included treasures like the Farnese Cup and paintings by Uccello and Pollaiuolo. Yet not even Vasari and Condivi, who seated Michelangelo at the dinner table, put him in Lorenzo's bedchamber, as Beck suggests: ''With a modicum of imagination one can envisage Lorenzo reclining on the bed, chatting with guests and perhaps even an attentive Michelangelo from time to time.'' The cumulative weight of such conjectures creates an embroidered version of the artist's life perhaps no less mythic than those of the early biographers.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/03/14/1092077.xml	        Although Beck devotes considerable space to exploring Michelangelo's relationship with Lorenzo (much of it hypothetical) and with Pope Julius II (much of it well documented), the world that Michelangelo inhabited with his family remains dimly lighted. The artist's father and brothers take up less than one-fifth of the chapter titled ''Michelangelo and His Father, Lodovico''; most of the discussion concerns artistic productions like the marble David (documented) and the artist's ties to the preacher Savonarola (hypothetical). And what about his much discussed sexual orientation? While allowing that his celebration of the male nude extended to a masculinization of his female subjects, Beck denies that Michelangelo was a homosexual, ''closet or otherwise.'' Nor was he particularly attracted to women. According to the author, the sparse evidence suggests that the artist ''had few, if any, sexual experiences.'' Passion he had, but it was directed toward his art. And yet Beck rejects the long-held view, promoted by Michelangelo himself, of an artist whose ''terribilit'' matched that of his irascible patron, Pope Julius II. A close reading of the artist's correspondence reveals a kinder and gentler Michelangelo whose own temperament was ''a gentle and compassionate one.''
nyt_corpus_1999.har/03/14/1092077.xml	        Although the most vocal of critics of the recent cleaning of the Sistine Chapel frescoes, Beck confines himself in this book to Michelangelo's activities there. But he is no less provocative for all that. His contention that Michelangelo's devotion to the concept of family in his own life inspired the overarching theme of the ceiling is intriguing, even plausible. More problematic is an observation about acorns that embellish the imitation marble ribs of the superstructure and sprout from the leafy garlands supported by the Ignudi -- male nude figures framing the narrative scenes. The acorns not only refer to the coat of arms of Pope Julius II's family, the della Rovere (in a pun alluding to ''robor'' -- a Latin word for oak); they are also ancient symbols of fertility. This fortuitous dual symbolism, Beck proposes, inspired Michelangelo to create a visual pun to amuse his patron: ''those della Rovere acorns are shaped too much like the phalluses of the 'Ignudi' holding them not to have been intentional.'' The acorns relate as well, he suggests, to a phallic Tuscan slang appellation, ''insulting yet endearing,'' that here presumably referred to the Pope himself. Renaissance wit was subtle and often salty; whether it extended to the transcendent reality of the Sistine ceiling is open to debate.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/03/14/1092077.xml	        Beck's formal analyses of Michelangelo's works are sensitively observed, but this is not the place to look at the art. The illustrations are skimpy, and many of the works discussed are not shown. And in a last word in an old argument, Beck uses (to my mind, regrettably) murky plates showing a Sistine Chapel ceiling before its restoration. It is ironic that a book seeking to uncover Michelangelo's early life declines to uncover the layers of dirt and grime that obscured the luminous frescoes that Vasari had praised for refreshing ''darkened eyes at the fount of clarity.''
nyt_corpus_1999.har/03/21/1093942.xml	        He had been right about the United States in at least one important respect: he recognized that engineering was close to the heart of our identity -- engineering but not painting. There are, it is remarkable to realize, no great paintings with which we identify as a nation, the way Mexicans identify with Rivera's murals, or for that matter Italians  with Michelangelo or Titian. Maybe we're too much enamored of the free market or too diverse culturally. But on the other hand, we link ourselves as a country with feats of engineering, with the Hoover Dam and the Brooklyn Bridge and even with Wright's Guggenheim Museum. They seem closest to the pragmatic core of our national psyche.

When the car is full, there may be 60 or 70 complete strangers crammed into it, any one of whom may be poised on the brink of madness. Your neutral request that he move over may be all that's needed to send him down into a black pit of manic rage. And not only will he hurtle downward, he'll try to pull you with him. So silence and no eye contact. Eyes are often raised upward in studious attention, as though Michelangelo's last and little-known commission had been discovered on the curved white ceiling of the No. 6 train. Or focused discreetly on the floor. This is safer than the ceiling, because looking downward partly conceals your face and throat: no one can cast his mad eyes across your features, measuring your cheeks for slashes, your neck for fingers.

Basically, he conformed to the Victorian mold of an art critic, focusing on the characters of the people portrayed in a picture or sculpture and their emotional effect on him, not on the balance of a composition or its other formal properties. We should remember that in 1900, when ''Interpretation of Dreams'' was published, the figures commanding respect as authorities on art included Nietzsche, Tolstoy and Benedetto Croce, all of whom equated art with feeling.

In between the ends lie Heaven, Hell and the Last Judgment; Sargent did pages of sketches of chains for the judgment scales. The ghost of Michelangelo hovers. The wonderfully appropriate underlying theme must be, as Mary Crawford Volk, an independent art historian, suggests in the retrospective's catalogue, the Word.

His celebrated public commissions include Civil War memorials to Lincoln, Admiral Farragut, General Sherman, Col.

Rejecting the ideal art of Raphael and Michelangelo, he placed the saint among the tricksters and rogues of his own day, even displacing Christ to the far corner of the canvas. A hard, cold light streams down on Matthew and renders his conversion all the more powerful by his isolation among the indifferent crowd. As Langdon reminds us, Caravaggio created a highly personal view of biblical times, couched in the fashions of contemporary Rome, thus transforming the present into an echo of biblical truth and simultaneously opening a debate about the role of naturalism in history painting.

Martin Luther's proclamations of 1517, which sparked the Protestant Reformation, helped diminish the authority of the church. Despite Luther's vicious anti-Semitism, his argument that every person should be able to read and interpret the Bible for herself, without lock-stepping with the priesthood, encouraged a certain freedom of mind. This religious freedom spread. For example, the subject matter of art turned from almost exclusively religious themes to landscapes, still lifes, interiors and other broad explorations of the secular and natural worlds.

Provocation serves this purpose. Once a politician responds to a museum's calculated outrage by threatening to withhold public money, the besieged curator invariably turns sanctimonious. Since the Mapplethorpe episode, when a Corcoran director ruined her career by actually bowing to Jesse Helms, arts administrators know better than to yield any quarter in fights with politicians. Instead, they must play to their own absolutist constituency, expressing righteous indignation at the threat of censorship, even though they are privately delighted to receive it. The curator cites Goya, Michelangelo and Stravinsky, declaring that great art has often given offense and implying, illogically, that work that gives offense must therefore be great.

It does involve ''a kind of artistry using iconography that maybe did not exist in the recent past,'' he added, ''but it is the art of stagecraft.''

Yet he died a ruined man, after spending tens of thousands of francs of his own money to make sure that big opuses like the organ at the Church of St. Ouen in Rouen, described by Widor to the builder as ''an organ a la Michelangelo,'' turned out the way he wanted them to, whatever the contract and payment terms.

When the first visitors to the Sistine Chapel looked up at Michelangelo's heaven, the music they heard was no less splendid, produced by composers such as Josquin, Adrian Willaert and Jean Mouton. Pomerium is among the very finest groups singing Renaissance polyphony, and its program drawn from this repertory should be a revelation. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Great Hall, Cooper Union, Third Avenue at Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200 or (212) 353-4195.Tickets: $15; $10 for students and seniors (Griffiths).
nyt_corpus_1999.har/11/02/1150059.xml	        The Vatican's Sistine Chapel, more noted for other things, was also a place for music, and as Pomerium's concert at Cooper Union on Saturday night took pains to show,  the Masses, motets and magnificats sung there were selected with an awareness of an enormous competition going on for the senses of those present. If Michelangelo's interiors were overpowering, it stood to reason that music in the Sistine Chapel had to be the same.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/11/02/1150059.xml	        Alexander Blachly, director of this venerable 14-strong a cappella group, chose his program from the Sistine's choir books used during the first third of the 16th century, when a succession of popes were showing unusual generosity to the arts. Josquin is a frequent entry and, indeed, was regarded by papal music critics of the time as a Michelangelo in sound. In a program that included music by Costanzo Festa, Andreas de Silva, Elzear Genet, Jean Mouton and Willaert, there were items of more outward drama than Josquin's two entries on Saturday. But the breadth and depth of his interweaving voices dominated everything around them, as they probably did almost 400 years ago. Not all composers wait for posterity to be recognized.

In Michelangelo Pistoletto's 1966 ''Cubic Meter of Infinity,'' six mirrors are tied together, reflective sides facing in; they form a brittle looking cube that combines Donald Judd's sleek elegance, Richard Serra's sense of threat and Robert Morris's perceptual puzzles.

Could we also make an argument for him in high art terms? Sure. We could point out how we admire dead foreign illustrators like Daumier and Jose Guadalupe Posada and Heinrich Hoffmann-Donner (the children's illustrator from whom Balthus, among others, copied), but how we unfairly dismiss Rockwell. Winslow Homer's illustrations for Harper's Weekly are taken seriously because they're by Homer. Why not Rockwell's illustrations? Museums are full of pictures by old masters like Hals and Greuze and Boilly that, like Rockwell's pictures, show everyday scenes. On top of which there is Rockwell's subterranean complexity: the buried allusions he made to Michelangelo's Isaiah in the figure of ''Rosie the Riveter'' or to Mondrian's grids in the window frame of ''Shuffleton's Barbershop.''

nyt_corpus_1999.har/12/11/1159919.xml	        Ending a 20-year restoration of the Sistine Chapel, the Vatican today unveiled newly cleaned frescoes by Botticelli and other 15th-century artists that had long been overshadowed by Michelangelo's masterpieces.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/12/11/1159919.xml	        Even after Michelangelo's ''Creation'' and ''Last Judgment'' frescoes were painstakingly restored, it took five years of careful scraping and wiping to clean centuries of dust, soot and grit off scenes from the lives of Jesus and Moses that line the walls beneath Michelangelo's ceiling. At long last, the entire room is uniformly bright, glittering with vivid blues, rich crimsons and gold, and long-forgotten details.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/12/11/1159919.xml	        ''The most important thing is that the unity of the color schemes with Michelangelo's work has been refound,'' Arnold Nesselrath, director of the Vatican Museums' department of Byzantine, medieval and modern art, said today at a news conference.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/12/11/1159919.xml	        The frescoes, executed between 1481 and 1482, some 25 years before Michelangelo began painting the ''Creation,'' are by the most famous artists of their time, Tuscans brought to Rome by Pope Sixtus IV.  They are well known to art historians, but less so to ordinary tourists.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/12/11/1159919.xml	        Perhaps only in the Sistine Chapel could biblical scenes by the likes of Botticelli, Ghirlandaio and Perugino  be so easily overlooked by the thousands of visitors who stream through the vast room every day, heads tilted back to take in Michelangelo's vast and overpowering vision of Creation, which includes Adam's arm reaching out to to touch the hand of God.  The restoration of the ceiling, begun in 1979 and completed in 1990, was surrounded by controversy as a small but emphatic group of critics complained that the restorers had rendered the ceiling too bright and almost vulgar.
nyt_corpus_1999.har/12/11/1159919.xml	        There were fewer complaints by 1994, when the restoration of Michelangelo's ''Last Judgment'' was completed. And few art historians expect much conflict over the cleaning of the 15th-century frescoes. ''I doubt there will be a fuss this time,'' said Luciano Bellosi, a medieval-art historian at the University of Siena. ''I've seen some of the frescoes, and they were in fairly good condition, so most of the restoration work is really just a cleaning. Of course, any restoration represents a kind of trauma to the work of art, but really, I think this one is very good.''
nyt_corpus_1999.har/12/11/1159919.xml	        The artists and their apprentices executed their work with unusual speed: it took 30 restorers and technicians five years to clean frescoes painted in less than a year. Of 16 scenes from the life of Moses and 12 of the life of Jesus, fewer than a dozen survive intact, and many were completely destroyed long ago. Perugino, whose rendition of Jesus' giving keys to St. Peter is among the most famous of the works, also executed a fresco of the Assumption of Mary over the altar. That was summarily destroyed to make room for Michelangelo's ''Last Judgment.''
nyt_corpus_1999.har/12/11/1159919.xml	        Nazzareno Gabrielli, the Vatican museums' director of scientific research, was one of several restorers eager to enhance the reputation of the 15th-century artists -- even at Michelangelo's expense.

nyt_corpus_1999.har/12/11/1159919.xml	        He lavishly praised the Tuscan artists for adapting so easily to materials then found only in Rome. ''For the first time, they were using plaster made of lime and pozzolana,'' he said, referring to a form of volcanic ash that was also used in ancient Roman times. ''And they painted on it so naturally -- the same as Michelangelo. But for Michelangelo, it was normal; it wasn't for them.''

Even Michelangelo was said to have gotten into the act, passing off a Cupid he had carved as an ancient work by burying it in the ground to achieve an antique patina.
nyt_corpus_2000.har/02/13/1175920.xml	        When, in 1506, diggers' shovels hit a large piece of ancient sculpture in Rome's Esquiline Hill, news of the event was sent urgently to Pope Julius II, who dispatched the Vatican architect, Giuliano da Sangallo, to oversee the precious work's safe extraction. Sangallo's son was with him (we have the account from him), and so was a young colleague, Michelangelo Buonarotti. The son jumped down into the pit, while his father, standing over it, excitedly proclaimed, ''That is the LaocoRated PG-13n, which Pliny mentions.'' When the sculptural group was carefully swung up to the surface, says the son, ''everyone started to draw.'' The find would be broadcast throughout Europe by the Renaissance equivalent of photojournalists. Soon kings and nobles would be asking the pope for copies of the famous episode from Virgil's ''Aeneid,'' the priest LaocoRated PG-13n entangled in the snake coils that kill him and his two sons.
nyt_corpus_2000.har/02/13/1175920.xml	        The passage in Pliny that allowed instant identification raised more questions than it cleared up. Pliny said the group was carved from a single piece of marble, but artists, among them Michelangelo, threw doubt on that assertion. Pliny also attributed the work to a collaboration of three artists, which seemed an affront to any concept of the individual genius in antiquity (as well as to this work being wrought from a single stone). But most puzzling was his assertion that this group was ''a work superior to all other paintings or statues.'' Did this give ancient warrant for settling the contest between painting and sculpture for the highest rank of artistry? Books 35 and 36 of Pliny's ''Record of Nature'' were the principal source of Renaissance knowledge about ancient art theory and practice. Was his expertise vindicated or made suspect by this discovery? Did other parts of his work -- including a glorification of deceptive imitation -- gain or lose authority, now that his verdict on a specific artifact could be tested against the object itself?

What he does so brilliantly for the LaocoRated PG-13n Barkan goes on to do for other statues literally unearthed or otherwise brought to light during the Renaissance -- the Spinario (boy taking thorn from foot), the Arrotino (man sharpening knife), the sleeping Ariadne, the Pasquino (soldier carrying a body), various river gods, various crouching Venuses, the sleeping Hermaphrodite.
nyt_corpus_2000.har/02/13/1175920.xml	        The most important and artistically valuable ancient object that Barkan treats is the Belvedere torso -- which was thought to be the trunk of a seated Hercules. The torso was a touchstone for Michelangelo, much of whose work was a meditation on it, a playing of variations on it. Though Barkan treats other misattributions, he does not explore the possibility -- now a near certainty -- that the torso is not of Hercules but of Marsyas. The figure is seated on a Phrygian leopard skin, not on Hercules' lion skin, and though Barkan acknowledges that fact, and says that some now think the figure is of Philoctetes or Marsyas, he does not take seriously the powerful case Gosta Saflund has made that the dowel holes for added parts on the statue prove that its arms were bound behind its back, in the well-known pose of the Phrygian flute player Marsyas, waiting to be flayed by Apollo for challenging him in a music contest. The pose shows up on Attic vase paintings, but it was best known in the Renaissance from a famous ancient medallion in the Florentine palace of Michelangelo's patrons, the Medici. If Michelangelo did not see the original there, he could have seen one of its many reproductions. Would he have known that this carnelian figure was Marsyas? His friend Vasari did. Would he have connected it with the marble torso? Saflund shows that he often imitates the torso, in his carved slaves and painted nudes, with the arms drawn back, to achieve the torque of the stomach muscles in the Belvedere fragment.
nyt_corpus_2000.har/02/13/1175920.xml	        Michelangelo's poems show that he was obsessed with the idea of binding and flaying. For the ''Last Judgment'' he put his own face on the flayed skin of St. Bartholomew, who twists his arm back holding the knife of his torture, flexing his trunk muscles in the Belvedere manner. If Michelangelo did not intuit or suspect that the torso was really Marsyas, he acted as if he did. Examining this possibility would have added another layer to Barkan's finely textured discussion. That he did not is the more surprising since he treats the Marsyas myth in describing the Arrotino (who sharpens the knife for Apollo to use on Marsyas), and he prints there a picture of the Medici medallion. Michelangelo quoted and admired Dante's use of the Marsyas myth. It was probably connected, consciously or unconsciously, with his love of the tortured Belvedere trunk.

Yet when Mr. Rihm talks about music, it is not systems and sciences that interest him but the healing powers of intuition. What listeners intuit -- and they had a chance to do so at the Miller Theater on Saturday night -- might be an earnestness of purpose, a carefully constructed density of thought and a fascination with the territory between song and speech. The Ensemble Sospeso, gracefully led by Jeffrey Milarsky, offered the brief instrumental triptych ''Pol -- Kolchis -- Nucleus'' and two vocal pieces: ''O Notte'' after a Michelangelo poem, and ''The Farewell Songs'' to texts by Wolf Wondratschek.

It can be slightly old or completely new. Many collectibles are factory fresh. It should have a pop-culture connection so that everybody can recognize what it is meant to be. It should be mass-produced, preferably in a large number of variations, so there is the challenge of completing a set. One-of-a-kind artifacts, like Michelangelo's David, are useless to a serious collector. He needs Michelangelo's George, Michelangelo's Tony and Michelangelo's Pokemon Pikachu to complete the set. Ugliness is a big plus, especially for porcelain objects. And most collectibles are tiny, so they can be crowded onto miniature shelves and knocked down by visiting children and the family cats. Collecting big things, like (say) historic utility poles, or used truck tires, is liable to create practical problems and difficulties in the family.

Pablo Picasso was another. Michelangelo Merisi -- known as Caravaggio after his Italian hometown -- is a third. Soon after he reached Rome at 21 in 1592 Caravaggio became notorious as a troublemaker and street fighter. Contemporaries described him as touchy, turbulent and so unpredictable he seemed at times almost unhinged. He was said to sleep fully armed in his clothes with his dagger ready for the draw. He certainly killed at least one man in a brawl, and spent the last few years of his short life as a bandit on the run with a price on his head.

nyt_corpus_2000.har/03/26/1186641.xml	        McCarthy began writing fiction in 1938, at 26, when the second of her four husbands, Edmund Wilson, deciding she had a talent for it, shut her in a room and forbade her to come out until she had finished a story. Her first effort, ''Cruel and Barbarous Treatment,'' which she wrote -- because of these conditions -- in one sitting, is one of her best. Consisting of a young woman's musings on the protocols of her extramarital affair, it charts the devolution of vanity and self-indulgence with the precision of an algorithm. (''It was not, in the end, enough,'' the young woman sighs, tiring of the private nature of her drama, ''to be a Woman With a Secret, if to one's friends one appeared to be a woman without a secret.'') In her later fiction, though, especially in her best-known novels, ''The Groves of Academe'' (1952) and her only best seller, ''The Group'' (1963), the scorching McCarthy had applied so delicately in her first book -- a torch adding bite to a creme brlee -- grew fiercer and less controlled. She once said in a speech that she admired Michelangelo's sculptures because he left ''some mark of the tools on the marble rather than have a smooth, polished surface. I think it has something to do with truth,'' and indeed, it seemed that for her truth had more to do with the work of hacking than with any particular result. She detected its presence by the smell of blood.
nyt_corpus_2000.har/04/02/1188521.xml	        While there have always been artists who remained active into their 70's and beyond, they once seemed slightly freakish, if only because there were never all that many Titians or Michelangelos at any given time. But times are changing, and so are actuarial tables. The average American born in 1920 died at 54. Now he will live to 73 or she to 80. This well-known fact is as applicable to artists -- at least those who take reasonable care of themselves -- as anyone else, but its implications have gone unnoticed by the news media. As any journalist can tell you, today's youth-conscious editors want to run stories about the next new thing, not the last old one.

With the possibilities created by new technology, architecture has recently become more compelling for him. ''There is an extremely new domain being constructed, which partly undermines architecture or eliminates the reason for being of architecture -- the electronic domain,'' he says. ''Now is an existential moment for a discipline that will decide whether it will be a dinosaur or whether it will be reinvented.''

So I think it's valid to say that 1945-65 was a golden age for foreign films. It was a remarkable, probably unrepeatable moment, when masters from the silent era (like Luis Bunuel, Jean Renoir, Yasujiro Ozu, Kenji Mizoguchi, Marcel Carne) were still producing some of their greatest work, veterans entering middle age (Federico Fellini, Akira Kurosawa, Roberto Rossellini, Luchino Visconti, Ingmar Bergman, Vittorio De Sica, Michelangelo Antonioni) were reaching their peak and newcomers (Jean-Luc Godard, Francois Truffaut, Satyajit Ray, Andrzej Wajda, Jacques Demy) were stunning the world with their audacity and reinvention of film form.

For several centuries, artists regarded the male rather than the female nude as the noblest subject they could treat. In the 19th century, when the naked female triumphed decisively over the naked male in art, it turned out to be a pyrrhic victory, with women not so much ennobled as reduced to sex objects.

As much portraits of places as they are essays in plot and character, they have lost none of their power to convey fragmented social relationships and the oblique urban environments in which human affairs unfold.

Each of the 10 fables of ''The Decalogue'' is a contemporary variation on one of the Ten Commandments. Far from preaching in the Hollywood biblical manner, these tales gaze with a searching (and sometimes teasing) concentration into the gaps between faith and reason, destiny and chance,  cause and effect, to discern elusive glimpses of a higher moral order governing human fate. Because they're stories created for a television series, they're also extremely entertaining.

Whitman did not welcome the prospect of the Civil War but loved his country too much not to support the effort to preserve the Union. When he received news that his brother George had been wounded, he rushed to find him. What he found was a healthy brother and tens of thousands of men who lay dying for lack of care. Whitman spent the next three years among the sick, wounded and dying, administering small gifts and great compassion, for which they would not forget him. The war put an end to what Whitman called his ''New York stagnation,'' when he was growing moldy with insurmountable family troubles and excessive drinking. Equal parts biography and Civil War history, ''The Better Angel'' also incorporates the poetry as it reflects Whitman's wartime experiences. It is a thrilling narrative told with empathy and vast learning, rich with images that reinvigorate figures as familiar as Lincoln: ''Whitman felt it would take four different sorts of genius -- Plutarch, Aeschylus, Michelangelo and Rabelais -- to truly sketch Lincoln's portrait.''

Ms. Hicks lets gallery visitors detour to her studio, and she frequently will have something dramatic to let them observe. She often primes her canvases with black gesso instead of the usual white. ''Working from dark to light is a way of revealing light,'' she said. ''I think of Michelangelo revealing the body that was inherent in a block of marble. It makes you work.''

Jim Logan's witty painting ''A Rethinking on the Western Front'' (1992) is a gloss on Michelangelo's famous image ''The Creation of Man'' on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. In place of the original's Eurocentric figures, it substitutes an Indian God reaching out to touch the finger of an Indian Adam.

Casa Buonarroti, Michelangelo's house, which is now a foundation and study center, has one of the world's largest collection of his drawings. Since there are only about a dozen drawings by him in the United States, the show will give visitors insight into his working techniques.
nyt_corpus_2000.har/12/29/1258755.xml	        On view will be sketches and studies he made for the frescoes on the ceiling and wall of the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican, as well as many studies for the church of San Lorenzo in Florence. These include the largest known architectural drawing by Michelangelo still in existence: a three-foot-wide study for the facade of San Lorenzo.

Many items in the show are sketches, writings and studies from his notebooks. They include a sonnet in his handwriting beside a caricature of himself painting the Sistine chapel's ceiling; labeled blocks of stone that were instructions to workers at a quarry; and drawings of food made to help an illiterate assistant prepare his meals. The exhibition also features architectural studies for the Medici chapel and library at San Lorenzo and studies for figures in the Sistine Chapel, among them a page of nudes and the torso of Adam from ''Expulsion From the Garden.''

nyt_corpus_2000.har/12/31/1259071.xml	        The concept of the Old Master is traceable to late-16th-century Italy, when the art of what was then seen as an earlier golden age -- the work of Raphael, Leonardo and Michelangelo, among others -- was assessed as having a permanent high value. But the term itself only appeared in the late 18th century, and ''gradually came to embrace all those artists who had lived before the French Revolution.'' The Old Master exhibition emerged along with another 18th-century invention, the museum. They share the feature of bringing together ''in a clearly defined space works of art (often of the most varied kinds) that had originally been designed to be seen in wholly different locations,'' and both helped give flesh to the idea that such varied works are all examples of a thing called art, with its own history and its own field of expert study. The modesty of Haskell's tone disguises the import of his subject matter, which, as in his earlier essay ''The Painful Birth of the Art Book,'' is ultimately the evolving social practice of art itself.

''It interested me to go down that path. How are things made? That's why I studied engineering. Architects work in abstract terms, while engineers work more with models of nature. In the Renaissance and the Gothic period, they worked inward from the stone: how does the arch behave, what are the lines of pressure, what is the form that the arch should take? It's like Michelangelo, who finds the figure inside the block of stone.''

In a celebration of the 10th anniversary of an influential distributor of independent films, BAMcinematek, the repertory program of BAM Rose Cinemas, is presenting a retrospective. The series consists of 16 rarely seen Milestone releases, including Michelangelo Antonioni's ''Red Desert'' (1964) and Luchino Visconti's ''Rocco and His Brothers'' (1960). This weekend's attractions include films by and about Alfred Hitchcock, and a film directed by, written by and starring one of Japan's most intriguing filmmakers. At 4:30, 6:50 and 9:10 p.m. today, the series will present Alfred Hitchcock's ''Bon Voyage'' and ''Aventure Malgache,'' two 1944 tributes to the French Resistance said to have been banned by the British government for nearly 50 years. Though commissioned to make films to raise morale in occupied France, Hitchcock instead created two dramatic stories characterized by his customary ingredients: espionage, suspense and murder. The screenings will be followed by Richard Schickel's portrait ''The Man Who Made the Movies: Alfred Hitchcock'' (1973). At 2 p.m., 4:30, 6:50 and 9:10 p.m. tomorrow, Takeshi Kitano's ''Fireworks'' (1997) tells the story of a police officer who abandons conventional morality for the sake of a dying woman. The series continues through Jan. 27 at the Bam Rose Cinemas at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene. Admission, $9; $5 for students, children under 12 and the elderly.

Suddenly, the Sixth Generation filmmakers seem fixated on themes of anomie, alienation and dissolving identity -- all maladies of individualism -- whereas the Fifth Generation directors, among them Chen Kaige (''Farewell, My Concubine,'' 1993) and Zhang Yimou (''Raise the Red Lantern,'' 1991), were concerned with social issues and reclaiming Chinese history. (A series of nine Sixth Generation films, including ''Platform,'' Jia Zhang Ke's magnificent 2000 chronicle of post-Mao China, will be shown at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center from Feb. 23 through March 8.)

Only an ironist would have realized that you didn't have to choose between the austere Spanish pavilion and its kitschy Belgian cousin. Only an ironist could appreciate the installation that Jean Rosenthal designed for Michelangelo's ''Pieta'' in the Vatican Pavilion. The great marble sculpture looked like a novelty ice cube floating in a Trader Vic's cocktail made with blue curacao. And why not? When else would the ''Pieta'' get to take a vacation from St. Peter's? Why shouldn't it want to dive into a big blue daiquiri?

Born on either side of 1500, they were still incipient geniuses when the High Renaissance peaked in the decade before 1520. As such they belonged to the first wave of Italian artists to face working beyond the galvanizing yet daunting fusion of religious faith, classical form and empirical observation achieved by Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael.

A brief stint working in Mantua exposed him to Mantegna's frescoes, especially the laughing faces and illusion of blue sky painted on the ceiling of the Camera degli Sposa in the ducal palace. A visit to Rome gave him firsthand knowledge of the spatial majesty of Raphael's Vatican frescoes and the monumental figures of Michelangelo's Sistine ceiling. Leonardo's atmospheric sfumato -- the use of light and shade rather than line to define form -- was another crucial influence.

To middle-class America, as it was to upper-class Victorian England, being Italian is the most fun you can have and still be white. We believe that if you had a choice, you'd be Italian, too. In fact, in her 1990 book, ''Ethnic Options: Choosing Identities in America,'' the sociologist Mary C. Waters described a survey in which she asked people of varied ancestries which ethnic group they'd belong to if they could choose. '' 'Italian' was the most common response,'' she reported.

And now it is the turn of Ermanno Olmi, who came to filmmaking at an electrical plant in Italy where he began as a clerk. His films celebrate the dignity and humanity of ordinary people. The retrospective of 14 programs of his works and 2 by his students reaches a high point this weekend with screenings of ''The Tree of the Wooden Clogs'' (1978). Written, directed and photographed by Mr. Olmi, this beauteous epic chronicle of the lives of turn-of-the-20th-century peasant families in his native Lombardy won the Golden Palm at the Cannes International Film Festival. The screenings are scheduled for 1, 4:15 and 7:30 p.m. today and 4 and 7:30 p.m. tomorrow. The series continues through April 12 at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center. Admission: $9; $5 for Film Society members; $4.50 for 65+ at weekday matinees. Information: (212) 875-5600 (Lawrence Van Gelder).
nyt_corpus_2001.har/04/01/1282097.xml	        If David Markson is anything like Writer, a lugubrious fellow who pops up intermittently in THIS IS NOT A NOVEL (Counterpoint, paper, $15), his latest experimental outing, he seems to have written a book that's entertaining in spite of himself. Writer mopes around, feeling ''weary unto death of making up stories'' and ''equally tired of inventing characters.'' In an apparent bid to make his readers just as miserable, he wishes to ''contrive'' a ''novel'' without either. (Next on his to-do list: a disloyal dog and a flavorless cassoulet.) The result, like Markson's previous novel, ''Reader's Block,'' looks a bit like an old-fashioned commonplace book, a compendium of phrases, quotations, notions and facts, in this case mostly about famous writers, artists, composers, scientists and other historical figures. Despite its atomized condition, the book does, as Writer hopes, seduce the reader into turning pages. Why it should succeed at that when most other books with the same anti-narrative agenda fail isn't hard to explain. ''This Is Not a Novel'' may not be a story, but it is something equally addictive: gossip, with a dash of puzzle. Sexual improprieties aren't a primary focus, but professional sniping is, from Michelangelo calling Leonardo ''as ignorant as a maidservant'' to Orwell describing Auden as ''the kind of person who is always somewhere else when the trigger is pulled.'' Those with investigative proclivities can trace Writer's gloomy preoccupations through the items about how various notables died (and which in states of financial destitution). Other items are more enigmatic (why did Henry James hide behind a tree to avoid Ford Madox Ford?), and a handful have an evocative, lovely melancholy: ''When and where did the last person die who still believed in the existence of Zeus?''

nyt_corpus_2001.har/05/11/1292295.xml	        The discovery of a Michelangelo drawing that Sotheby's is auctioning in London on July 11 is one of those once-in-a-lifetime events most experts only dream about.
nyt_corpus_2001.har/05/11/1292295.xml	        ''I started going through the pages, and at the end of the book I felt like someone hit me in the face,'' Mr. Stock said. There, among a group of undistinguished drawings, was a three-quarter-length study of a woman seen from the side, her face obscured by her hand and the folds of her cloak. Mr. Stock said he thought it was an early Michelangelo.
nyt_corpus_2001.har/05/11/1292295.xml	        After many years of research, he turned out to be right. ''With these big houses there's usually something you miss,'' Mr. Stock said. The contents of Castle Howard, known to millions of television viewers from Evelyn Waugh's ''Brideshead Revisited,'' are well known to Sotheby's experts. The auction house has been selling the contents of Castle Howard since 1991 -- everything from dusty bureaus, dinner services, rusty watering cans and old carriages right on through a multimillion-dollar 17th-century painting by Il Guercino, the old master. But nowhere in the inventories of the house was there a mention of a Michelangelo.
nyt_corpus_2001.har/05/11/1292295.xml	        The drawing, ''A Mourning Woman'' from around 1500 when the artist was 20 to 30 years old, is in two shades of brown ink heightened by white and is similar in character to four other early figure drawings by him in museums in Paris, Munich, Vienna and London. Each shows one or two figures, drawn in strong, dense penwork. Two have been identified as being based on frescoes by earlier masters like Giotto, and all were inspired by 13th- and 14th-century Florentine painting, which Michelangelo studied closely at the beginning of his career.

Timothy Clifford, the director, was able to raise some money for it but not enough because he was also seeking donations for a major museum renovation. Since the National Gallery of Art in London has its share of Michelangelos, as do the museums at Oxford and Cambridge, and since the National Galleries of Scotland cannot afford it, it will no longer pose a question to heritage officials who might otherwise have stopped it from leaving Britain, saying it was a national treasure.

He gives Milton's Adam and Eve beauty and physical potency. They are sexual creatures. And when Satan stands on a rock exhorting his band of fallen angels to revolt against God, it is as if Michelangelo's angels had undergone the rigors of the Reformation; Satan is muscular and long-limbed and perfectly proportioned.

Then it was on to Rome and the influences of Michelangelo and Raphael. Seven years later, having alienated a crucial patron, he moved to Spain; in 1577 he settled in Toledo, where he eventually established a busy workshop of his own and died in 1614.

The body of the First Terrified Man is now in one piece, and his robe flattens dramatically against his body, as if from the power of Jesus' anger. The foreground has been swept clear.

Drawings in the artist's favorite red chalk cover both sides of the sheet, probably done about 1510-11. One side contains a muscly study for a youthful male nude (known as an ''ignudo'') done in preparation for the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel; the other bears four sketches of the left foot of the ignudo, part of a heel and two unfinished male figures.

nyt_corpus_2001.har/06/03/1298357.xml	        Halfway through the book, Crain adopts a more independent line. He suggests that Emerson's contradictions might be explained by the fact that ''homosexuality was taboo in Victorian America'': ''This simple explanation has no high-theoretical glamour to recommend it, but it clears up a number of longstanding paradoxes about Emerson's heart.'' It also makes for a more efficient description of the subtle ways in which homosexual love was expressed. Emerson, for instance, translated the homoerotic poems of the 14th-century Persian poet Hafiz, cloaked his meanings in misty convolutions and referred to the illicit tastes of historical figures: ''Let none presume to measure the irregularities of Michelangelo and Socrates by village scales.'' Brown translated his desires into Gothic horrors. ''Unnatural'' sexual tastes were forbidden, but who would have detected a homosexual allegory in the description of a man killing a male panther and eating it raw?

nyt_corpus_2001.har/07/15/1309339.xml	        IT'S the kind of discovery that makes an art historian's day. In 1521, Michelangelo did a sketch of scowling monsters and the head of a gargoyle. To the side, more faintly, he drew a robed woman. In the 1980's, scholars questioned whether the woman was linked to the tombs Michelangelo designed in the Medici Chapel. Then, 11 years ago, conservators removed the picture from its mount and discovered, on the back, a drawing of a sarcophagus.
nyt_corpus_2001.har/07/15/1309339.xml	        European artists did not begin using paper regularly until the 15th century and, early on, its scarcity led them to draw on both sides. Like Michelangelo, many never anticipated that their sketches would become framed collectors' items, so they didn't identify one side as ''recto'' (front) and one as ''verso'' (back). Curators, collectors and dealers made those subjective decisions.

nyt_corpus_2001.har/07/15/1309339.xml	        Though serious collectors flock to these kinds of casual drawings today, artists' quick sketches weren't always considered particularly desirable. During the Renaissance, as Mr. Harper writes, ''the premium that we post-Romantics place on visible traces of 'the hand of the artist' was still far in the future.'' Nonetheless, Michelangelo, perhaps wary that art historians might judge him by his sketches, set scores of them ablaze. For Renaissance collectors, however, drawings appealed because they were cheaper to amass than paintings. Some things don't change.

Whatever that is, we think we recognize it in Michelangelo, Titian, Rembrandt and Monet (and Dali and de Chirico, whose late work was more like a calamity). Probably ''old-age style'' should be defined on a case-by-case basis, especially now that we are redefining old age.

The movie is divided into two parts. The first half concentrates on the neo-realism of Rossellini and De Sica. And the cumulative impact of those serial visions of poverty and despair amid the postwar ruins is emotionally overwhelming. Part 2, which isn't as wrenching, examines the work of Luchino Visconti, who brought a high-style operatic sensibility to realist filmmaking; Fellini, who emerged from neo-realism as a maestro of the phantasmagoric; and Michelangelo Antonioni, the poet of modern metaphysical malaise.

These are some of the ingredients we've come to expect from Mario Puzo's Mafia novels. In his final novel, ''The Family'' -- Puzo died in 1999, and this book was completed by his companion, the novelist Carol Gino -- he has dipped back into 15th-century Italy to tell the tale of the Borgia family, led by Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia, who became Pope Alexander VI. In an afterword, Gino explains that Puzo was fascinated with the Borgia family: ''He swore that they were the original crime family. . . . He believed the popes were the first dons -- Pope Alexander the greatest don of all.'' He may have been right. And with four dysfunctional kids to follow in the family business, Puzo has a worthy cast of characters. So why doesn't this well-researched novel work? One of the joys of ''The Godfather,'' Puzo's best-known book, was that he took us someplace we'd never been -- deep into the hearts and minds of ruthless men who managed to cling to a code (warped as it might be) of behavior. Here, however, it's as if Puzo had simply cobbled together his knowledge of the Borgias while forgetting to create three-dimensional characters. Too much is told, rather than dramatized. The language and dialogue are often stilted, and even cameos by Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Machiavelli don't help. Nor do Puzo and Gino give us much insight into how ostensibly religious men could break nearly every commandment before evening prayers.

Most of these objects vanished into storage when they were found to be in the ''style of Cellini,'' or outright fakes. Possibly because of the number of false attributions, Cellini's luster began to tarnish. His work was called decorative and lacking in power compared with that of an artist like Michelangelo.

That assessment still holds up.
nyt_corpus_2001.har/11/04/1339989.xml	        Michelangelo famously stated that sculpture already existed buried within the marble; his task was to carve away the excess stone. In a similar way, Cellini pushed to the limit the plastic qualities of bronze, its going from fluid to solid.

Keith Christiansen, a curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, read an open letter to Mr. Hockney testifying that he had gone out and bought a concave mirror at Duane Reade. His verdict? The projection the mirror threw onto his paper wasn't clear enough for him to make a decent drawing. Besides, he added, there is plenty of evidence that artists like Michelangelo, Raphael and Caravaggio had ''no need for fuzzy, upside-down images.'' They made freehand preparatory sketches instead.
nyt_corpus_2001.har/12/09/1349687.xml	        Hockney concludes that art history needs to be radically reconceptualized. Instead of those fusty categories based on style -- Baroque, Mannerist, neo-Classical -- Hockney proposes that Western painting should be seen as the product of two rival camps. There is the ''lens-based tradition,'' which includes suspicious detail fetishists like Caravaggio and Hans Holbein the Younger. Then there are the ''eyeballers,'' those artists who remained defiantly low-tech; pre-eminent in this category are Michelangelo (it's hard to fake it with fresco) and the famously loose-brushed Rubens. You can even play the game with today's artists: Chuck Close belongs to the lens-based camp, Lucian Freud to the eyeballers.

Raphael learned from both men, but while he made use of their exploration of human anatomy, he added sentiment to his paintings.

These would consume Raphael for the best part of a decade, with those of the Stanza della Segnatura, which include his vast ''School of Athens,'' the most outstanding. In 1514, following Bramante's death, the pope named him architect of St. Peter's. Even more than Michelangelo, at work at the time on the Sistine Chapel, Raphael was the pope's painter.

The reason is partly the names: people go to read, touch, leave flowers and photographs beside the names. But the genius of the design is the combination of names with Minimalist sculpture: Ms. Lin recognized and exploited the inherent theatricality and ambiguity of Minimalist abstraction, linking it with the most literal kind of descriptive device, a list, which represents every person who died not through some generalized image of a soldier holding a gun or a flag but specifically, by name. She grasped two things: the value of naming and the nostalgia inherent in what you might call the modern memorial sublime, the way Minimalist art and its Post-Minimal legacy, precisely because of its stripped-down, elemental forms, evokes a kind of long-lost grandeur. It is the closest modern art has come to an alternative to the heroic public sculptural ambition of Michelangelo or Bernini.

Giacomo Meyerbeer, the titan of French grand opera, ranked by his contemporaries with Michelangelo, was of German birth. Likewise Jacques Offenbach, whose frothy operettas earned him the sobriquet Mozart of the Boulevards. That the galaxy of divas and divos onstage were cosmopolitan, too, should come as no surprise.

nyt_corpus_2002.har/07/10/1407111.xml	        In the ultimate case of finding treasure in the attic, a visiting museum director from Scotland on a busman's holiday in New York sifted through old boxes of drawings of light fixtures at the Cooper-Hewitt design museum and has discovered what several experts agree is a work by Michelangelo.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/07/10/1407111.xml	        The large, intricate drawing in black chalk on cream paper, 17 inches high and 10 inches wide, was found in April by Sir Timothy Clifford, the director of the National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh. It shows an elaborate candelabrum with a two-part pedestal of monumental grandeur, typical of Michelangelo's architectural vocabulary. The pedestal, supported by lion's feet, flanked by winged seraphs perched on volutes, is a virtual encyclopedia of High Renaissance ornaments: garlands, rams' heads, masks and urns. The pedestal supports an equally complex multipart shaft of vases, more urns, balusters and branches, which are lightly drawn.

nyt_corpus_2002.har/07/10/1407111.xml	        In a phone interview yesterday, Sir Timothy, who knows Michelangelo's drawings well, responded with a roar of laughter. ''It was just as I recognize a friend in the street or my wife across the breakfast table,'' he said.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/07/10/1407111.xml	        Sir Timothy added that he believed the drawing relates to Michelangelo's great design for the Medici tombs in Florence -- and that the candelabrum is probably a menorah, although other scholars are not convinced about this.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/07/10/1407111.xml	        But authorities on both sides of the Atlantic have said the work is almost certainly by Michelangelo. George Goldner, the Metropolitan Museum of Art's drawings curator, said: ''The attribution is absolutely right. It's not a little fragment or scrap, either. It's a good, important drawing, which any museum would be happy to have, a wonderful discovery, a great thing.''
nyt_corpus_2002.har/07/10/1407111.xml	        Michael Hirst and Paul Joannides, prominent Michelangelo scholars in Britain, were shown the drawing and approve of the attribution, too, according to Sir Timothy and Cooper-Hewitt officials who were present when those experts reviewed the work.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/07/10/1407111.xml	        The discovery, although a great find in the Cooper-Hewitt, comes at an awkward moment for that harried Smithsonian Institution museum, where the new director, Paul Thompson, has lately laid off several curators. Among those departing is the curator of drawings, Marilyn Symmes, in whose care the Michelangelo had ostensibly been. Ms. Symmes did not return calls for comment.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/07/10/1407111.xml	        The museum bought the drawing in 1942 as part of a batch of decorative designs from P. & D. Colnaghi, a London dealer, paying $60. (Michelangelo drawings sell for millions of dollars now.) Colnaghi considered it an anonymous 16th-century Italian work. That dealer had acquired it in 1921 at Sotheby's in an auction from the collection of Lord Amherst of Hackney. Many museums have vast collections that go unstudied because they lack the staff or expertise to analyze everything. The Cooper-Hewitt has more than 160,000 works on paper. ''I doubt nobody had ever looked at the drawing before,'' Mr. Goldner said, ''but nobody had looked at it correctly.''
nyt_corpus_2002.har/07/10/1407111.xml	        Sir Timothy, heart in throat, instantly thought: Michelangelo. ''A lot of drawings like this are overlooked,'' he said. ''With Michelangelo, people think of great red-chalk figures, studies for Adam. They don't realize that Michelangelo was an architect and, like many Renaissance artists, was asked one moment to do a reliquary, the next moment to design a bronze horse.''
nyt_corpus_2002.har/07/10/1407111.xml	        The dream of every art historian is to find a Michelangelo. There are fewer than a dozen Michelangelo drawings in the United States. One was discovered in New York in 1976 at the Met. The museum had bought it in 1962, as the work of an anonymous artist in Michelangelo's circle.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/07/10/1407111.xml	        But more than a few purported Michelangelos have turned out to be wishful thinking or of questionable attribution. In the mid-1980's a plaster sculpture was trumpeted on front pages as a model for Michelangelo's ''David,'' only to be debunked. Frederick Hartt, a Michelangelo scholar who died in 1991, had put forward the Michelangelo connection for that sculpture, in which it emerged that he had a financial interest. In 1996 another sculpture, part of a fountain in the lobby of the French Consulate on Fifth Avenue in New York, was heralded as an early Michelangelo marble of Cupid, after which some scholars expressed doubts.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/07/10/1407111.xml	        In his rush of enthusiasm, Sir Timothy found at the Cooper-Hewitt another drawing that he thought was by Leonardo da Vinci. The experts don't seem to agree with him there. Mr. Goldner said: ''It's worth studying and it's a good drawing, but I'm not sure about Leonardo, whereas in the case of the Michelangelo I don't think there's any serious doubt.''
nyt_corpus_2002.har/07/10/1407111.xml	        Sir Timothy dates the work he attributes to Michelangelo to between 1525 and 1530, in Florence. He said Mr. Hirst, the British expert, believes it was drawn later, in Rome. (Mr. Hirst could not be reached for comment.) Mr. Goldner is not sure the candelabrum is a menorah, as Sir Timothy plans to argue in a forthcoming article in Apollo, a British art journal. Sir Timothy and the museum had kept quiet about the discovery so that he could prepare his research.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/07/10/1407111.xml	        Mr. Thompson, the Cooper-Hewitt director, said yesterday that for its part, the museum, although it has known about Sir Timothy's attribution since April, still needed time ''to tell the story of the drawing properly.'' The plan, he said, is to organize an exhibition for next year. Asked whether the museum might show the work earlier, because the public may be interested in a newly found Michelangelo, he said he wasn't sure. ''We're a public-access place so we need to think that one through,'' he said.

nyt_corpus_2002.har/07/13/1407738.xml	        It is perhaps a sweet irony that Sir Timothy Clifford is the art expert who unearthed the previously unknown drawing of a candelabrum attributed to Michelangelo at the Cooper-Hewitt, the National Design Museum of the Smithsonian Institution. For most of his career, Sir Timothy, the director of the National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh, has focused on American museums in a different way -- to thwart their efforts to export British-owned artworks.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/07/13/1407738.xml	        Sir Timothy says there was no trick to discovering the Michelangelo among forgotten sheets at the Cooper-Hewitt. ''It's just connoisseurship,'' he said. ''The ability to detect quality and artistic personalities was carefully nurtured in me by the art historians of a slightly earlier generation, people like Sir John Pope-Henessy and Philip Pouncey, who taught you how to really look at an object -- and I think it's quite disregarded among today's art schools and museums.''

nyt_corpus_2002.har/07/21/1410000.xml	        In recent years architectural historians have been rewriting the history of Renaissance and Baroque architecture in terms of individual patronage. They now give at least equal weight in explaining the rise of Europe's great churches, palaces and plazas to the patrons who decided what was needed as to the architects and artists who gave it form. Pope Julius II is celebrated as a vital partner with Donato Bramante, Michelangelo and Raphael in creating St. Peter's, the Sistine Chapel and the offices of the Vatican.

nyt_corpus_2002.har/08/20/1417221.xml	        With the statue of David never without a crowd of worshipers at the Galleria dell'Accademia, it could be said that every year is a Michelangelo year in Florence. But thanks to three exhibitions here this summer, il Divino, as Michelangelo is known to Italian devotees, seems more present than ever. In spirit at least. In reality, taken together, the three shows display fewer than a score of drawings and only a handful of sculptures that are confidently attributed to him.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/08/20/1417221.xml	        The point, however, appears to be that Michelangelo transmogrified the art of his times, both through his reinterpretation of male and female beauty and through the influence of his architecture, sculpture, painting and drawing on successive generations.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/08/20/1417221.xml	        That is the thrust of ''The Shadow of Genius: Michelangelo and Florentine Art From 1537 to 1631,'' the large show at the Palazzo Strozzi through Sept. 29. Its focus is very much on the ''shadow.''
nyt_corpus_2002.har/08/20/1417221.xml	        Two smaller exhibitions come closer to the artist himself and, above all, to his competing visions of physical and emotional attachment. ''Venus and Love: Michelangelo and the New Ideal of Beauty,'' at the Accademia through Nov. 3, explores heterosexual love, while ''The Myth of Ganymede: Before and After Michelangelo,'' at the Casa Buonarroti through Sept. 30, touches on Michelangelo's homosexuality and his infatuation with a young noble, Tommaso de' Cavalieri.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/08/20/1417221.xml	        Both shows are built around specific works: Pontormo's painting of ''Venus and Cupid,'' based on a life-size -- but lost -- drawing by Michelangelo, at the Accademia; and Michelangelo's drawing of ''The Rape of Ganymede,'' which is on loan to the Casa Buonarroti from the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University. Both works serve as departure points for reflections on Michelangelo's response to the human body.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/08/20/1417221.xml	        The sexual charge is strongest in ''The Rape of Ganymede,'' which Michelangelo gave to Tommaso de' Cavalieri in 1532 when he was just 12 and Michelangelo was 57. An undisguised allegory for the artist's passion for the boy, it portrays Zeus as an eagle kidnapping a beautiful young Trojan to become his cup bearer. In Michelangelo's rendering, while the eagle grips the boy's legs firmly with his talons, Ganymede's relaxed arms suggest he welcomes the abduction.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/08/20/1417221.xml	        In ''The Punishment of Tityus,'' another mythological drawing given to Tommaso that is in the Casa Buonarroti show, Michelangelo seemingly implies that his love is accompanied by torment. Here the lustful Tityus is shown being punished by having a vulture devour his liver for eternity. Yet letters between Michelangelo and Tommaso hint at no particular anguish: in early-16th-century Florence, it seems, intimate relationships between men and boys were not uncommon.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/08/20/1417221.xml	        The show, organized by Marcella Marongiu, concentrates on the myth of Ganymede because it has long caught the imagination of artists. It is portrayed in golden Greek earrings and a bronze Etruscan engraving from the third century B.C., as well as a Roman agate-and-onyx relief and a marble statue from the first century A.D. Revived in the Renaissance, the myth would have been familiar to educated Florentines. Michelangelo himself did a study for ''The Rape of Ganymede'' in 1502 and a different version in the late 1520's.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/08/20/1417221.xml	        At the Accademia, ''Venus and Cupid'' also comes with a story, that of the wealthy patron Bartolomeo Bettini, who in 1532 invited Michelangelo, Pontormo and Bronzino to decorate a room in his Florentine palace. Unusually, Pontormo, no mean artist in his own right, was willing to copy in oil the ''Venus and Cupid'' drawn by Michelangelo. The painting, which was then confiscated by Duke Alessandro de' Medici, is the only surviving testimony of the drawing.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/08/20/1417221.xml	        Few paintings, though, were more copied in the 16th century than ''Venus and Cupid,'' which contemporary poets described as ''designed by Michelangelo and colored by Pontormo.'' Records speak of 32 copies, with 16 extant and 2 in this show. Thanks to a restoration this year, the original ''Venus and Cupid'' can also be seen as it was painted, without the clothing that was later added to cover Venus's nakedness.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/08/20/1417221.xml	        The exhibition, displayed in the Accademia on two sides of Michelangelo's ''David,'' goes beyond ''Venus and Cupid'' to study other examples of the artist's treatment of the reclining nude, through oil copies of his sculptures of ''Night'' and ''Dawn'' from the Medicis' tomb in the New Sacristy of the Church of San Lorenzo and through a full-size copy of his lost drawing, ''Leda,'' which shows the mother of Helen of Troy being seduced by Zeus in the guise of a swan.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/08/20/1417221.xml	        These works in turn spotlight Michelangelo's representation of the naked female form. And here the exhibition's curators, Franca Falleti, director of the Accademia, and Jonathan Nelson, a professor of art history at Syracuse University in Florence, are eager to dispel the popular notion that Michelangelo's homosexuality meant his ignorance of women led him to portray them as muscular, masculine figures with breasts attached as afterthoughts.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/08/20/1417221.xml	        Since it was customary at the time to work from life models, Mr. Nelson asks, ''Can we really believe that Michelangelo, the most famous artist of his day, had less access to female models than his contemporaries?'' Further, his anatomical sketches demonstrate that he could reproduce the human body to perfection. But as the subtitle of this show suggests, in his allegorical and biblical paintings, sculptures and drawings, Michelangelo was seeking a ''new ideal of beauty,'' one inspired by art rather than nature.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/08/20/1417221.xml	        ''Regardless of Michelangelo's personal views about women,'' Mr. Nelson notes in a catalog essay, ''he strove to create beautiful images of them, and his Tuscan contemporaries enthusiastically praised and commissioned copies of these figures.'' They were also defiantly different from those of the Venetian masters. Vasari said that after visiting Titian in his studio, Michelangelo remarked, ''It is a shame that in Venice they never learned to draw well from the beginning.''
nyt_corpus_2002.har/08/20/1417221.xml	        The show at the Palazzo Strozzi, in contrast, is a celebration of the Florence that Michelangelo left behind when he moved to Rome in 1534. And it sets out to demonstrate how his influence on architecture, sculpture, drawing and even the decorative arts was felt in the city for the best part of a century. This exhibition will be at the Art Institute of Chicago from Nov. 9 to Feb. 2 and at the Detroit Institute of Art from March 16 to June 8.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/08/20/1417221.xml	        Visitors drawn to the show only by Michelangelo's name, however, may be disappointed. From Michelangelo, it has just a half-dozen fine drawings, including ''Lamentation for a Dead Christ,'' and a splendid marble statue of ''Apollo/David.'' On the other hand, those seeking an exhibition that might better have been called ''Art in the Age of the Medicis'' will be delighted by a virtuoso display of the Mannerist art of High Renaissance Florence.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/08/20/1417221.xml	        The first two sections, called ''The Living Legend'' and ''Father and Master of All,'' trumpet the Michelangelo connection and underline his influence over Pontormo, Bronzino, Vasari, Cellini, Baccio Bandinelli and Pierino da Vinci. And the case is well made through Bandinelli's bronze statue of ''Neptune,'' Cellini's bronze of ''Perseus and Medusa'' and da Vinci's marble statue of ''River God,'' on loan from the Louvre.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/08/20/1417221.xml	        But while the riches of the show go on, Michelangelo's ''shadow'' seems to fade as successive Medici rulers of Florence express their wealth, power and patronage in everything from the fine arts to architecture, decorative and applied arts, and garden design.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/08/20/1417221.xml	        The show ends with a ''virtual'' visit to the Casa Buonarroti, the house that Michelangelo bought and never occupied and that was turned into a museum by his great-nephew. On the other hand, for anyone in Florence it is far simpler to see the real thing a few blocks away on the Via Ghibellina. And there, in the gallery's permanent collection, one can find much more of Michelangelo's work.

Prime works by some of them -- Michelangelo, Bronzino, the sociopathic Pontormo -- appear in an exhibition of 180 paintings, prints and porcelains. Art Institute of Chicago. Nov. 9-Feb. 2, (312-443-0193) www.artic.edu. Traveling to the Detroit Institute of the Arts, March 16-June 18.
nyt_corpus_2002.har/09/10/1422413.xml	        Assembled over 40 years, the collection includes 16th-century Italian prints that document lost works by Michelangelo; superb engravings by the Dutch Mannerist Hendrik Goltzius; a trial proof etching by the 19th-century British visionary Samuel Palmer; and a rare 1964 color lithograph by Mr. Johns, created in 1963 for the cover of a book by Mr. Steinberg. Jonathan Bober, the curator of European art at the Blanton, describes the collection as ''one of the finest in private hands in the United States.'' Its value is estimated at $3.5 million. The diversity of Mr. Steinberg's acquisitions jibe with his own polycultural background. He was born in Moscow in 1920, spent his childhood in Berlin, then studied painting and sculpture at the Slade School in London. After World War II he settled in New York and worked as a translator and drawing instructor at Parsons School of Design. Right after completing graduate school at the Institute of Fine Art, he started buying prints.

Somehow, he missed the big story: tea. It's been the great Italian blind spot ever since.

But Cézanne, Matisse and Picasso were already working from photographs, a method that must pose a different problem to a sculptor than to a painter. Giacometti looked at a photograph of an archaic Greek male statue, arms rigidly at its sides, and drew his own more elongated and even stiffer version in the margin. He juxtaposed his hieratically frontal vision of a woman to a picture of the Esquiline Venus, who bends one knee, raises one arm and shoulder and turns her head to the side. In other books, he drew the head of a Gothic figure, the hand of a Byzantine saint, the pose of Michelangelo's Libyan Sibyl. He copied everything, even architecture, even Mondrian.

Beginning with examples by Pisanello and Donatello, the medals and plaquettes proceed from the mid-1400's to the early 1600's, encapsulating the genius of the Italian Renaissance while portraying many of its leading lights (Alberti, Michelangelo). Western painting and sculpture were then on equal terms, and these tiny bronze dimensional images functioned as the artistic equivalent of a swing vote, reflecting and stimulating developments in both mediums.

Ranging from a curvaceous frost-covered ladder by Pier Paolo Calzolari to a blank piece of cardboard plopped on the floor according to Emilio Prini's instructions, the show exhibits more than 100 works by 14 artists -- with Jannis Kounellis, Aligierhi Boetti, Michelangelo Pistoletto and Gilberto Zorio providing most of the interest.

These were the Medici grand dukes of Tuscany, the ruling family of Florence, and between 1537 and 1631 their patronage shaped the city's artistic identity. Beginning on Saturday, at the Art Institute of Chicago, this story will be told through 200 masterworks, rarely on loan, most never before seen outside Italy and some among the glories of the Uffizi Gallery, the Pitti Palace and the Bargello Museum. The sculptures and drawings include works by Michelangelo, among them the statue ''Apollo/David.''

But Michelangelo's ''Pietà'' is also recreated in two photographs, one a realistic image by Raymond Voinquel that shows a crucified Christ lying across his mother's lap, and a more stylized ''Anima Mundi (Pietà)'' by Ulay and Marina Abramovic, in which a woman in a red evening dress holds the inert figure of a man dressed in white.

They also allude shamelessly to landmarks in Western art, ''ideals of beauty'' expressed in works by Michelangelo, Canova and Rodin, which, Ms. Zelevansky said, makes them appropriate for show in an encyclopedic museum. The exhibit, however, is not without a sexual component. Using dental plastic, Mr. Edmier has cast two orchids that allude explicitly to male and female genitalia.

Derek Bermel's ''Spider Love'' (1999) has the melodic lilt and rich-textured chord progression of a sophisticated cabaret song; now and then one could detect the faint shadow of Kurt Weill. Jack Beeson's ''Prescription for Living'' (1978) straddled the worlds of cabaret and opera. And Charles Naginski's ''Look Down, Fair Moon'' (1940), a setting of a harrowing verse from Whitman's war poetry, ended the set on a dark, sobering note.

nyt_corpus_2002.har/12/08/1446656.xml	        TAPESTRY IN THE RENAISSANCE: Art and Magnificence. By Thomas P. Campbell. (Metropolitan Museum/Yale University, $75.) When 16th-century royals sought to impress, at home or on the road, they decorated their walls with expensive tapestries designed by some of the greatest artists of the age, and threaded with gold and silver. The mystery at the heart of this sumptuous book is how such works of art, ''the perfect medium of ostentation,'' could have escaped for so long the serious notice of connoisseurs attuned to the merits of Michelangelo and Raphael. Thomas Campbell, curator of decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and his international team of experts have no trouble persuading us that the finest examples ''deserve to be ranked among the greatest artistic creations of the Renaissance.'' The Belgian artist Bernaert van Orley melded Raphael's deployment of figure and space with Dürer's ''emotional intensity'' and hallucinatory attention to detail. In ''The Killing of the Wild Boar,'' from his series on imperial hunts, three muscular hunting dogs, one in armor and the others wearing richly embroidered collars, sink their teeth into the defiant prey while a mounted swordsman comes in for the kill. An ivy-covered oak separates horse and boar; its placid inhabitants -- a squirrel chewing an acorn, a woodpecker, a meditative crow -- remain undisturbed by the mayhem below.

It also follows one other novel, ''Ex-Libris,'' a bibliophilic whodunit (or whohasit, since its main concern is a missing manuscript) set in 17th-century London and Prague. ''Domino,'' however, was King's first book, published in England in 1995. It is no mere beginner's effort. With its elaborate plot and lavish period detail, it matches the sleight-of-hand technique of ''Ex-Libris'' -- and in subject matter it presses deeper.

nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/05/1453939.xml	        Five hundred years ago, the Medici lavished money on artists like Michelangelo, presiding over a spectacular flowering of the arts that helped make Florence a great Italian cultural center. Today, 200 works of art produced under their patronage are on view in ''The Medici, Michelangelo and the Art of Late Renaissance Florence'' at the Art Institute of Chicago.

Most of the works have never before traveled outside Italy.

When Salvador Dalí rediscovered it in the 1930's, it was a Sleeping Beauty's castle, overgrown with thorns and weeds (Dalí made an unsuccessful bid to buy the Orsini castle to throw a ball for the beggars of Rome). The sculptures are perhaps a retelling in stone of Ariosto's bloody Renaissance epic, ''Orlando Furioso,'' but the lingering mystery over the prince's intentions is what is most satisfying about the Parco dei Mostri.

nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	        A visitor to this gilded city is struck almost instantly by Michelangelo's creative munificence. In domes, chapels and statues, he left the world with some of its most sublime works of art.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	        Michelangelo, beneath it all, was a miser.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	        That is one conclusion of a recently published book, ''The Wealth of Michelangelo,'' by a professor of art history here who found in Renaissance archives a surprising financial profile of unacknowledged wealth and unwarranted thrift.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	        Although Michelangelo bellyached aplenty about deprivation and has often been cast as somewhat poor, he died in 1564 with the modern equivalent of tens of millions of dollars, according to the professor, Rab Hatfield, an American who teaches at the Syracuse University program in Florence.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	        That money was not some late-in-life windfall. Professor Hatfield's research shows that for most of Michelangelo's nearly 89 years, he was marginally, moderately or massively rich. But he often refused to show it, and often declined to share it.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	        And yet, Professor Hatfield said, Michelangelo would complain to family members about how short of money he was, melodramatically bemoaning his lot while warding off their requests for help.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	        On the road with a pair of assistants, Michelangelo would get just one bed for all of them, and the reason, Professor Hatfield said, was not erotic but economic. The artist was hoarding his lucre.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	        That research confirms, and adds copious detail to, something that art historians have come to realize about Michelangelo but many other people have not: any agony that sullied his ecstasy was not financial.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	        Professor Hatfield homed in on that through several bank accounts of Michelangelo's that had never been studied before, during a research mission with other purposes.

nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	        Michelangelo was treated, and compensated, very well.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	        When Michelangelo worked on the Laurentian Library here in Florence, he was on a monthly salary from Pope Clement VII that equaled about $600,000 a year, Professor Hatfield said.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	        For a tomb for Pope Julius II, according to the professor, Michelangelo got the rough equivalent, by one calculation, of more than $10 million over time, even though he did not come close to completing the project.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	        The professor said that the house in Rome in which Michelangelo died had little furniture, no books and no jewels, but it did have a chest with almost enough gold currency to buy the Pitti Palace.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/21/1458241.xml	        What kind of person did that make Michelangelo?

nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/25/1459232.xml	        Art patronage on a grand scale is about getting power, holding on to it and making it look pretty. That's a central premise of ''The Medici, Michelangelo and the Art of Late Renaissance Florence'' at the Art Institute of Chicago, a show packed like a bank vault with precious objects, many of them associated with a family of middle-class merchant-bankers who strove to be kings.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/25/1459232.xml	        His grandson, Lorenzo, called the Magnificent, nurtured the young Michelangelo, bringing him to live under his roof. Lorenzo's largesse paid off. Michelangelo (1475-1564) became a megastar, bigger than Florence, bigger than Italy, bigger than life. And as his reputation spread throughout Europe, it lent his hometown patrons the kind of luster by association that money alone cannot buy.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/25/1459232.xml	        Art patronage played a role in dynastic advancement, and Michelangelo remained a crucial shaper of the Medici image. In 1519, he was asked to design a new facade for the family church of San Lorenzo and to create a family tomb. The facade project fell through, and he left the tomb unfinished when he went to Rome in 1534, never to return to Florence. Yet the sculptures he completed -- among them four allegorical figures representing times of day, and the sweet, sleepy David or Apollo that is in the show here -- determined the course of Florentine art.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/25/1459232.xml	        It starts with the years just after Michelangelo's departure, with the coming to power in 1537 of a second Cosimo -- Cosimo di Giovanni delle Bande Nere de' Medici (1519-74) -- who established a new family line and the first autocratic Medici court. While Cosimo the Elder had presented himself as a citizen among citizens, his namesake assumed a fancy title: Cosimo I, duke of Florence and grand duke of Tuscany. The art he sponsored matched and amplified his regal aspirations.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/25/1459232.xml	        If, for example, he couldn't have Michelangelo himself, he would at least hire artists who inventively emulated him. Among the most interesting was Jacopo Carrucci, known as Pontormo (1494-1557), a peculiar man and a fantastically inventive painter, as is suggested by a drawing in the show. It is a highly idiosyncratic version of one of Michelangelo's Medici tomb figures, in which the various anatomical parts -- head, buttocks, legs -- seem to belong to different bodies but together make a freakish, Mannerist sort of sense.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/01/25/1459232.xml	        Of course, overwhelmingness was what the Medici dukes were after, and the show's curators -- Marco Chiarini, Alan P. Darr and Larry J. Feinberg -- get that exactly right. It may say something about our own hype-battered modern tastes, though, that the single most moving work -- a wooden crucifix attributed to the aged Michelangelo -- is also visually the most modest. Small, sketchily carved and unfinished, thought to have been a gift for his nephew, it seems to emerge from a private, interior world in which surface polish and earthly ambition play little role. It too is power art, but of a very different kind.

Professionalization of architecture is a relatively recent phenomenon -- formal architectural education, for example, did not appear until the 19th century. Before that, becoming an architect did not mean mastering a discipline but attaining a position. That position assumed a knowledge of the classics (for all architecture then was rooted in the ancient Roman world), skill in geometry and, usually though not always, previous successes in the fine arts. It was all charmingly improvised, and judging by the built results, extremely effective.

nyt_corpus_2003.har/02/16/1465187.xml	        In the renaissance, when the client commissioned art as well as architecture, many practitioners (Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael) pursued both lines of work. Later, while architecture continued to be driven by the client's demands, the content of the ''pure'' arts came to be seen as properly determined by the artist. When Diller and Scofidio speak of straddling the line between artist and architect, they mean that as architects they assert the artist's prerogative of dictating the program. In a remarkable way, the form of their best work is generated from their wide-ranging inquiry into program, not geometries. Of course their client gives them a site and a list of practical requirements, but the resulting building comments on those demands while satisfying them. One recent project was the ''Blur'' pavilion, built over Lake Neuchâtel for Swiss Expo '02. A steel structure studded with thousands of nozzles generated walls of mist.

His leading lady, with whom he fought throughout production, further complicated his task.

This show, organized by the museum and previously seen in Florence and Chicago, illuminates the use of art to symbolize the power of the four Medici grand dukes who ruled Tuscany from 1537 to 1631. Among 180 works in this show are sculptures and drawings by Michelangelo (whose ''Crucifix'' is shown at left), Cellini and Giambologna; paintings by Bronzino, Pontormo, Salviati and Vasari; and decorative works and tapestries that have never previously traveled outside Italy.

In 1890, at the height of his fame as a society portraitist, he accepted an offer by the architect Charles McKim to paint a series of murals for the soon-to-be-completed Boston Public Library. Here was a chance to prove that he was no artistic lightweight, but a deep thinker in the heroic tradition of Michelangelo and Raphael.

A dozen or so artists, Friedrich's chosen ones, would be freed of all constraints and allowed to pursue work as they envisioned it. Naturally, this fueled deep suspicion and jealousy in the art world, but Friedrich compared what he was doing -- now with his wife's fortune -- to the Medicis. ''Dia didn't tap something new; it tapped something old,'' he said at the time. ''Our values are as powerful as those in the Renaissance.'' For emphasis, he added that Dan Flavin ''is as important as Michelangelo.''

In 1977, Friedrich's SoHo gallery became a permanent locale for De Maria's ''The New York Earth Room'': 280,000 pounds of dirt trucked in and spread 22 inches deep across 3,600 square feet. The room had to be regularly hosed and raked and cleared of mushrooms. Employees were assigned to watch silently over it -- no reading was allowed on the job, lest their distraction disrupt the aura of aesthetic contemplation. De Maria's ''Vertical Earth Kilometer'' was completed that same year: a slender 18-ton rod sunk into a 1,000-meter hole drilled in Kassel, Germany, leaving only the tiny circle of one end visible in the ground. The cost: $419,000, and $2,500 a year to maintain.

Ever since he bought it in 2000, the yacht overshadowed other trappings of his privileged position in corporate America -- his Nantucket estate, Sea Rose farm, with its $5 million, 7,000-square-foot mansion set on 3.8 acres by the sea; his retreat in Boca Raton, Fla., which people close to the company said was paid for with a $19 million no-interest loan from Tyco that was later forgiven; his residences in New Hampshire and Manhattan; even the infamous $2 million birthday party he threw for his wife in Sardinia, featuring waiters in togas and an ice sculpture replicating Michelangelo's ''David,'' from which Stolichnaya flowed into crystal glasses.

The Sargent family was living in Rome that winter, and the 12-year-old Sargent spent hours in the chilly Vatican galleries, honing his drawing skills by sketching works from antiquity.+Sargent (1856-1925) became one of the most international American artists of his day, shuttling around Italy, France, England and the United States, but he knew Italy most intimately. His Italian connections, from his birth in Florence to the Italian Renaissance influences in his murals, are the subject of the essays in SARGENT AND ITALY (Los Angeles County Museum/Princeton University, $49.95). Sargent hated the dull routine of society portraiture, and his Italian trips -- painting peasants in Capri, Venetian bead stringers, Alpine brooks -- refreshed him. Particularly interesting is Jane Dini's essay, ''Boston's Michelangelo,'' which discusses the Boston murals that Sargent considered his most important work. He relished the chance to bring his considerable knowledge of history and literature to his painting, and to work in the style of the Renaissance artists he had idolized as a child. In 1917, the art critic Frederick William Coburn reported on the progress of Sargent's murals at the Boston Public Library: ''Given perhaps five years more, one mind, one pair of hands will have presided over the creation of an American Sistine Chapel.''

Not to mention their names and personas, modeled after four cornerstones of Renaissance art: Donatello (wearing purple), Leonardo (blue), Raphael (red) and Michelangelo (orange). Or the fact that their master is a wise old rat named Splinter.

Its landscape is composed of mountain and coast, with almost nothing in between. Its people are famously stubborn -- ''hardheaded,'' even ''wooden heads.'' Northern Italians despise Calabria and see only the dirt; foreigners are nervous there. Its own native sons too often become defensive or downright euphemistic when they write about the poverty and the omertà that are inscribed in its history.

Sometimes we are reminded that ego is hardly a Freudian invention, as with Christopher Donahue's comic delivery of Leonardo's self-serving comparison of the sculptor's rude existence to the refined lifestyle of the painter, during which another actor strikes poses like ''David,'' the best-known sculpture of Leonardo's arch-rival, Michelangelo.

Apparently the master has just stepped out for a bowl of spaghetti, leaving several drawings casually draped over the scaffolding, paint brushes in a pot and the day's patch of fresh plaster marked out and waiting to be frescoed. The shadows of assistants loom behind a curtain of thin fabric on one side, while on the ceiling God's hand eternally approaches Adam's across the most frequently reproduced gap in painting.

Art museums try to do the same, fostering a sense of intimacy and connection to the artists (museum-certified celebrities) and a feeling for their lives. This begins with photographs -- unavailable, alas, in Michelangelo's case -- and sometimes extends to reconstructions of studios (though usually you're not invited in). Houston's amusing, down-to-earth version of the Sistine scaffold is either virtual reality of the old-fashioned sort, the art museum's answer to science museums' walk-in models of the human body, or Las Vegas at the Vatican.

Should the marble colossus be restored to its original perfection or simply cleaned of grime? Or should it learn to live with the blotches of venerable old age?

nyt_corpus_2003.har/07/15/1504607.xml	        It's not easy being the world's most famous statue. Michelangelo's ''David'' has managed to rouse passions and provoke controversy ever since 1504, when unruly Florentines greeted its unveiling with a hail of stones. Since then it has been the target of rioters who hurled a bench at it in 1527, breaking the left arm in three pieces, and of an envious artist named Piero Cannata who took a hammer to it in 1991, demolishing one of its toes. Few masterpieces of Western art have been on the receiving end of so many projectiles.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/07/15/1504607.xml	        Michelangelo's nude giant has also been the victim of guardians of public morality who, in the middle of the 16th century, insisted on the addition of a metal loincloth made of 28 fig leaves -- a prudishness repeated in 1995, when religious authorities in Jerusalem declined Florence's gift of a full-scale replica of ''David'' unless its privates were similarly concealed.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/07/15/1504607.xml	        In sharp contrast, the approach for cleaning ''David,'' when it was announced last fall, seemed surprisingly low-tech: Agnese Parronchi, the chief restorer, was to emerge from the wings of the Galleria dell'Accademia at closing time and begin gently scrubbing at the marble with an assortment of badger-hair brushes, cotton swabs and rubber erasers before giving the statue a rubdown with a chamois cloth. Although newspapers around Europe reported that ''David'' was being given a bath, Ms. Parronchi, in fact, planned to use very little water, believing it would remove not only dirt but also the protective coating of oil applied by Michelangelo himself.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/07/15/1504607.xml	        The relative failure of such a high-profile project as the 20-year campaign to restore Leonardo's ''Last Supper'' should warn us about both the seductive promises of science and the zealous interventions of the restoration industry. At a time when the more venturesome solutions to conservation problems regularly steal the headlines, Ms. Parronchi's old-fashioned method might come across as a throwback to the days when Greek wine and stale bread were the restorers supplies of choice for scrubbing dirty frescoes. But her badger-hair brush also happens to be highly effective and perfectly safe. Although Ms. Falletti has speculated that Ms. Parronchi's humble tools could damage the statue, her previous undertakings -- most notably her work on the Medici tombs carved by Michelangelo for the New Sacristy in San Lorenzo in Florence -- underscore the soundness of her methods.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/07/15/1504607.xml	        Ms. Parronchi also seems to have valid reasons for her reluctance to subject ''David'' to newfangled restoration techniques. She has argued that the compresses favored by Ms. Falletti will leave untouched the pockets of grime in the statue's many pits and grooves, subtly diminishing its beauty. These concerns are shared by James Beck, a Columbia University art historian and Michelangelo expert who had to fend off libel claims in the Italian courts after criticizing what he regarded as the insensitive cleaning of a 15th-century tomb in Lucca.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/07/15/1504700.xml	        Heated debate rages over whether Michelangelo's David should be cleaned, restored or left untouched; 14-foot-high statue has stood inside Galleria dell'Accademia in Florence since 1873; Agnese Parronchi, experienced restorer first hired to clean statue, resigned in Apr, charging that officially approved method is too harsh and could cause damage; petition signed by 39 international scholars proposes suspending any action pending review by independent commission of experts; Antonio Paolucci, superintendent of Florentine art who has final say, announces that cleaning of David will begin in Sept with new restorer, Franca Falletti; Paolucci seeks to play down dispute between advocates of various methods of cleaning; last year he canceled plans to restore Leonardo's Adoration of the Magi in face of international protests; photos showing streaks and blotches of old age on statue of David (M)

nyt_corpus_2003.har/07/15/1504700.xml	        But there is no shortage of passion in the arguments brandished by Ms. Parronchi and Ms. Falletti and their respective supporters, arguments in which science and experience have been marshaled for partisan purposes. When Ms. Parronchi was named last September, she seemed perfect for the job, having won acclaim for her cleaning of Michelangelo's tombs of the Medicis in the Medici Chapel behind the Basilica of San Lorenzo and of his two reliefs, ''Madonna of the Stairs'' and ''Battle of the Centaurs,'' in the Casa Buonarroti in Florence. Once installed at the Accademia, working from a mobile ladder in full view of visitors, she spent three months making 360 digital graphics of ''David.''
nyt_corpus_2003.har/07/15/1504700.xml	        Of course, whether ''David'' needs cleaning at all is another matter, not least because the sculpture was never considered a perfect piece of marble. Excavated from the Fantiscritti quarry near Carrara, the 18-foot-high block was exposed to the elements in the courtyard of Florence's Opera del Duomo, the cathedral's storage space, for almost 40 years before Michelangelo tackled it. And even after completing his sculpturing, he spent four months treating and polishing the marble before its unveiling in September 1504.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/07/15/1504700.xml	        Since then, ''David'' has not always been handled respectfully. In 1527 his left arm was snapped off during a riot: the white mixture of lime and sand used to reattach it is still visible. Then, having absorbed soot for three centuries, the statue was subjected to still greater damage by two botched 19th-century cleaning jobs. In 1810 it was covered in wax. And in 1843 the wax, along with Michelangelo's original patina, was removed with hydrochloric acid.

Even today, when you come upon them in the sanitized confines of the Prado Museum, these nightmarish visions can unmoor you. An ancient crone grins ghoulishly over a bowl of food; a demonic figure whispers in the ear of a stooped old man; a midnight coven surrounds a goat-headed sorcerer; a dog raises its head forlornly; and, most famous of all, a raggedy-bearded man with bulging eyes devours a human form that is already reduced to red meat. Of this last iconic image -- called ''Saturn,'' after the Titan who ate his children -- the art historian Fred Licht has written that it is as ''essential to our understanding of the human condition in modern times'' as Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling is to our grasp of the 16th century.

But even here, van Tetrode cannot miss the opportunity to imply the possibility of tremendous force. More Samson than Hercules, Jesus seems, from one angle, on the verge of uprooting the column to which he is tied.

nyt_corpus_2003.har/08/24/1514540.xml	        When Michelangelo was in his mid-70's, he worked almost every day for several years, according to Vasari, on a complex four-figure sculpture designed to mark his own tomb. It depicted a crucified Christ being returned to the lap of his mother with the aid of Mary Magdalene and a bearded man chiseled with the features of the artist. Vasari reported being told that Michelangelo became so enraged with his servant's incessant nagging to finish that he attacked and mutilated the sculpture (his assistant later repaired some of the severed limbs). In an unusually suspenseful piece of historical scholarship, MICHELANGELO'S FLORENCE PIETÀ (Princeton University Press, $75), the art scholar Jack Wasserman uses a persuasive mix of technology and psychology to probe Michelangelo's intentions for this sculpture, which has been maligned by many over the centuries for its distorted proportions. Wasserman illustrates that when the massive sculpture is installed high above an altar, as he believes Michelangelo intended, rather than on a low pedestal as currently exhibited, the perspective adjusts correctly to the viewer looking up. Michelangelo therefore purposefully accommodated for distance and angle, common practice among Renaissance painters but not sculptors. Wasserman rejects Vasari's story and argues that Michelangelo engaged in ''selective pruning,'' that is, revision, not destruction. Unable ultimately to resolve the piece, though, Michelangelo gave it away, and it was not until the end of the 19th century that the Florence Pietà came to be appreciated by a modern sensibility pioneered in sculpture by Rodin, who admired the statue's raw surfaces and fragmentary qualities, and who once said, ''That which is more beautiful than a beautiful thing is the ruin of a beautiful thing.''

Achille Etna Michallon painted the villa, pink under blue skies, framed by a crumbling arch in the Borghese gardens. Artists copied Michelangelo and antique sculptures; they drew from live models and made huge works of art (billowing drapery, Virgilian scenery, ponderous male nudes) to satisfy the demands of the academic system in France, which awarded them a chance to be in Rome. But the striking works are often small, private pictures: not just portraits, but sketches of the Roman landscape, fresh and bathed in light.

nyt_corpus_2003.har/09/17/1520187.xml	        FLORENCE: DAVID'S BATH -- Michelangelo's 499-year-old David is going to be bathed in full view of the public with compresses of pulped cellulose, rice paper and distilled water. ''We are using the most harmless substance possible, water,'' said Antonio Paolucci, leader of the project, who noted that the 14-foot marble masterpiece will turn 500 next year. ''We want him to show up for his birthday in the best possible condition,'' he said on Monday. Tests on a small patches of the sculpture, covered with grime and dust, were carried out earlier this month, the BBC and Agence France-Presse reported. The cleaning of the Renaissance masterpiece, which has stood inside the Galleria dell'Accademia since 1873, has long been a subject of debate among Italian and foreign experts. Some have warned that the distilled water might go beyond removing dirt and inflict major damage on the statue, leaving it to appear to have been bleached. But Cristina Acidini, who leads the Opificio delle Pietre Dure, a government art-restoration department, defended the current plan, saying, ''Those who know about these things know that it is a treatment so delicate that you could use it on the skin of a baby.

It is ''The Last Judgment,'' not ''The Last Supper.''

Rossetti, Millais and Holman Hunt, who in 1848 were students at the academy, formed the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood with the idea of returning to the spiritual purity that preceded Raphael, Michelangelo and other Italian artists of the High Renaissance.

By 1570, he was described by the painter Giulio Clovio as a disciple of Titian, although Tintoretto and Jacopo Bassano seem at least as important to the work. He is said to have caused a ruckus by dismissing Michelangelo's ''Last Judgment'' in the Sistine Chapel, while lavishing praise on Correggio and Parmigianino, artists delicate in their sensuality, as opposed to the muscular Michelangelo.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/10/03/1524240.xml	        But Michelangelo shows up anyway as a huge force in El Greco's paintings, Michelangelesque twisting figures absented of their weight. Maybe it was the anxiety of influence. The human figure embodied the spiritual in art for both Michelangelo and El Greco. Michelangelo also preached the Neoplatonic idea of the sublime artist uncovering ideal forms already embedded in the materials, an essentially abstract notion of beauty, highly personalized, touching a mystical chord and locating genius divinely implanted in the mind of the sculptor or painter. This could just as well have been El Greco's credo.

In May 1975, the group grew too large and moved to the Vatican Pavilion site, where Michelangelo's ''Pietà'' was exhibited during the World's Fair.

It could be that we are in a golden age of drawing; ''Drawing Now,'' a show last year at the Museum of Modern Art, barely hinted at the wealth and variety of what is out there. But drawing is not the foundation of many big careers these days. Conceptualists, performance artists, photographers, assemblagists and even many kinds of painters and sculptors do not need traditional drawing skills. They may produce plans, diagrams, collages, cartoons or rudimentary visual notes that will be marketed as drawing, but rarely anything like the kind of draftsmanship you associate with artists from Leonardo and Michelangelo to Ingres, Degas and de Kooning.

While he's not one of those quiet classicists like, say, Poussin, Ingres, Mondrian or Agnes Martin, who will most likely never wind up fodder for dramaturges and screenwriters, he's not one of those tortured scenery-chewing figures like Michelangelo, Caravaggio, Vincent van Gogh, Stanley Spencer or Jackson Pollock that dramatization seems to demand.

Frankweiler,'' E.L. Konigsburg's novel about Jamie and Claudia, siblings who run away to -- of all places -- the Met. Last year, my own 8-year-old, Matthew, wanted to see the angel statue -- thought to be a Michelangelo -- in the book. After a random (and fruitless) search, we consulted members of the museum staff, who were nice enough not to roll their eyes and gently informed us that the Met had no Michelangelo sculptures.

Beyond the $15,000 poodle-shaped umbrella stand and the $6,000 shower curtain that, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, graced her home, the birthday party her husband gave her is one of the most prominent symbols of his excess. Prosecutors may show a videotape of it in the courtroom (his lawyers have argued to have it suppressed), which means she may have to sit by as jurors watch party guests being served by waiters in togas and drinking vodka spouting from an ice sculpture of Michelangelo's ''David.''

Instead of engaging in nonstop advocacy, she said, he bought a Volkswagen van and began traveling the country to pursue his love of oil painting. Accompanied only by a pet collie, Michelangelo, Mr. Lucas traveled from Maine to Hawaii, painting mostly landscapes and occasionally writing freelance magazine articles on painting techniques. He rarely stayed in one location long. For extra money, he taught law classes at local universities. He also did occasional pro bono legal work.

nyt_corpus_2003.har/11/11/1534429.xml	        ROME: MICHELANGELO'S MOSES -- While experts were debating methods of cleaning Michelangelo's 499-year-old statue of David in Florence, restorers in Rome were quietly finishing five years of removing stains from Michelangelo's 7.5-foot-high figure of a seated Moses, left, holding the tablets of the Ten Commandments, in the Church of St. Peter in Chains in Rome. ''The Moses encapsulates Michelangelo's real courage and passion,'' Antonio Forcellino, the chief restorer, told Reuters. ''He considered it his most important work.'' The marble statue was commissioned in 1505 by Pope Julius II.

That transformation -- and metaphor -- influenced a generation of artmakers. Like Mr. Antonioni's photographer, they wanted to enlarge the event, to get closer to the scene. Ms. Goldin investigates intimacy, her large-scale photographs even blow it up. Her work asks if an ineffable feeling or experience can be visualized, and, when it's photographed, if it is available to others. Do we feel it, too? What do we see?

nyt_corpus_2003.har/11/23/1537518.xml	        HECTOR BERLIOZ'S comic opera ''Benvenuto Cellini'' is about the creation of an artwork, Cellini's sculpture ''Perseus Holding the Head of Medusa,'' which stands in the Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence, Italy. Cellini was a Renaissance man in every sense: a 16th-century goldsmith, sculptor, musician and memoirist, a swaggering, self-satisfied figure who saw himself as Michelangelo's artistic equal. Artists have taken up his cause ever since. Goethe translated Cellini's autobiography into German. Berlioz, also basing his work on the autobiography, created an idealized operatic portrait of Cellini as artist.
nyt_corpus_2003.har/11/23/1537518.xml	        ''I would like to show more,'' he says. ''I would like to show Cellini's torments by love, his jealousy of Michelangelo. I try to act like three different characters in the three acts: in the first, a tender lover; in the second, a killer and agitator of the crowd; and in the third, an inspired artist. I try to make the role versatile, like a kaleidoscope.''

Parked in long rows throughout every Italian city, in candy-bright shades of apple, berry, lemon and licorice, they looked awfully tempting to me. My kids' pronouncement was ''sweet,'' and they wanted a taste. I could hardly blame them, as I marveled at all the gorgeous women in high heels and short skirts and men with faces that could have been chiseled by Michelangelo weaving past us, through the river of cars along the Tiber, as agile and sleek as the fish that got away. The beauty of their daring is something I'll never forget.

nyt_corpus_2003.har/11/30/1539113.xml	        This method, of course, also eliminates surprises. That Murray's conclusions will be utterly familiar to most readers does not make them wrong, but, along with his insistent focus on statistics, they do make his book, with its 458 pages (not counting five appendixes, a bibliography and notes), a rather numbing thing to get to the end of. Here are Murray's findings: Western civilization has generated the greatest number of important contributions to knowledge and the arts. (''What the human species is today it owes in astonishing degree to what was accomplished in just half a dozen centuries by the peoples of one small portion of the northwestern Eurasian land mass.'') D.W.M.'s -- dead white males -- have been more creative and innovative than dead minorities or women. Newton outranks Galileo in the combined sciences but ties with Einstein in physics. Darwin tops Aristotle in biology, though Aristotle beats Plato in philosophy. Confucius mattered more to the Chinese than Laotzu. Michelangelo was the greatest Western painter. Shakespeare was the greatest Western writer. The greatness of most of these men was called forth by a culture girded by a faith in its own purpose and value -- that is, by Christianity. Now that nihilism and relativism have supplanted faith, however, the West would appear to have lost its vitality and status as history's highest achiever: ''In another few hundred years, books will probably be exploring the reasons why some completely different part of the world became the locus of great human accomplishment.''
nyt_corpus_2003.har/11/30/1539113.xml	        Murray gives more thorough answers to the anticipated charges of Eurocentrism and cultural chauvinism. He has corrected for the tendency of encyclopedia editors to assign more copy on their own countrymen, he says, by using only data provided by foreign encyclopedias -- that is, by counting only entries in non-German encyclopedias for his ranking of Goethe, or from non-Italian ones for Michelangelo. As for the problem of bias against non-European contributions to the sciences, though he hasn't used any encyclopedias published in the Far or Middle East or in the languages of those parts of the world, he has compensated by using the most authoritative reference work available, the 18-volume ''Dictionary of Scientific Biography,'' which ''includes experts in Arabic, Indian and East Asian science drawn from universities around the world.''
nyt_corpus_2003.har/11/30/1539138.xml	        Ever since the Romantics, we have thought of artists as following their muses and of designers as chasing the market. An artist preoccupied with sales will risk being written off as a mercenary, while a designer neglectful of his audience will soon be out of work. In reality, designers and artists aren't separated by so sharp a line. When a designer sets out to improve an existing product, or to create a product that fills a newly perceived (or fabricated) need, she does not usually call in a focus group. She thinks, she tinkers, she reassesses -- much like an artist. Indeed, rather than thinking of a designer as a kind of artist, it might be better to regard the artist as a designer manqué. For, as Loewy said, the designer ''ought to have a background in both engineering and art history'' and ''to be open to an extraordinarily broad range of influences.'' The designer ought to be an artist, and more. The greatest artists of the Italian Renaissance -- Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael, Piero della Francesca -- were also engineers, architects, mathematicians, inventors. In short, they were designers.

nyt_corpus_2003.har/11/30/1539342.xml	        For the most part, great artists before Beethoven had behaved like normal human beings, some better, some worse. True, Michelangelo had been a handful, and the great artists were more likely than ordinary people to be colorful characters with large egos. But they also had vocations, in two senses. First, they had a demanding craft they were obliged to master. Second, they were trying to realize aesthetic excellence in their art. The notion that they were expressing themselves would have seemed odd to most of them -- self-expression was a byproduct of their work, perhaps, but secondary to the obligations they saw themselves as fulfilling.

nyt_corpus_2003.har/12/12/1542375.xml	        Other kinds of art do not. Heroic artists like Michelangelo or Picasso or Jacques-Louis David could conjure up gods and heroes and mythological worlds that might temporarily distract us from reality, stir our emotions and elevate us into a higher realm. But it is the ability of more circumscribed artists like Eckersberg to slow our systems and to show us reality as we may not have paused to consider it before. This is what inspired Proust to say, ''Great painters initiate us into a knowledge and love of the external world.'' Proust was thinking of Chardin, but Eckersberg, although a lesser sort of artist, also fits the bill.

His work takes in, and obliquely cross-references, art history (El Greco, Michelangelo, Rembrandt); religion (Jesus and the Virgin); literature (Rimbaud, Jean Genêt); and politics (a Gay Pride march and Inauguration Day ceremonies, both in the same painting.) He has given all the pictures a kind of jaundice-yellow Symbolist tinge: it's as if all their source images were similarly discolored with age, or as if all the paintings were coated with the same darkening varnish.

He had time, however, to order the destruction of Michelangelo's marvelous nudes in the Sistine Chapel: he was scandalized by them, impelled by the same anti-Renaissance moral fervor of the German Luther, who couldn't understand the typically Latin cult of beauty. Fortunately, there were some at the Vatican who knew how to obstruct Pope Adrian's order. Thus for 500 years, while for the most part Italy wasn't even a unified state -- unlike France, Spain, England, Russia -- that unique supreme Christian authority, purely Italian, nevertheless continued to represent the universality descended from the emperors.

Not that Mr. Thomas sings a note in ''Prelude and Liebestod,'' the terrifically enjoyable second part of this unbalanced evening from Terrence McNally (''Master Class''). But portraying a preening orchestra conductor who finds an autoerotic mirror in his music, Mr. Thomas generates a stormy passion that surely qualifies as Wagnerian. Directed by Leonard Foglia, and assisted by the ravishing Isabella Rossellini in her New York stage debut, Mr. Thomas churns up the seemingly shallow waters of this portrait of a flashy star of classical music. The evening's first play, ''Full Frontal Nudity,'' about American tourists in the presence of Michelangelo's David, is sketchily written and awkwardly staged. But ''Prelude'' enjoyably contrasts the grandeur of great art with the human pettiness of those who create it (2:15). 59E59, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200.

What kind of artist was he before he arrived in Rome? Who knows. No paintings survive attributed to his Lombard years. The show's gist is nevertheless that he became who he was then: that he took off from the works of predecessors like Savoldo, Sofonisba Anguissola and Vincenzo Campi, the most talented of several Campi, all of them, alas, dutifully represented in the exhibition.

Twenty-first-century eyes find them throughout the history of art -- for example, in the drips and random marks of the glazed ceramics of Tang dynasty China. In Western art, Michelangelo's late sculptures, with their rough-hewn surfaces, are often cited as early warning signals. But it is in the area of European prints -- especially as making successive proofs became a matter of course -- that the idea of what was and was not a complete work of art becomes most volatile and subversive.

It doesn't seem possible that he was dissatisfied with this exquisite grouping of the three shepherds and Mary, seemingly drawn in the finest pencil. The Baby Jesus and the manger may be lacking, but more would have been too much. The glowing blank paper provides a necessary relief from the intensity of Goltzius's realism and, combined with the light on the adorers' faces, it also suggests that the infant has simply been enveloped by his own radiance.

Situated in a piazza of the same name, its origins go back to A.D. 761, when Pope Paul I decreed that a church should be built here to house the venerated remains of saints formerly buried in the Catacombs. A relic of the head of St. John the Baptist is said to be kept in the first chapel to the left of the entrance. Reconstructed in the 16th and 17th centuries, the building assumed its present form in the baroque era, and Michelangelo is reputed to have played a role in the design of the high altar. In the late 19th century, after the unification of Italy, the Vatican designated San Silvestro as a parish for English-speaking Catholics.

As one publisher told me, ''Art is just as important as he thinks he is.'' He, too, fits the Crumb paradigm: childhood fascination with comics (in his case with ''Inside Mad,'' a paperback Mad Magazine anthology that he persuaded his mother to buy for him when he was 7), precocious development (as a teenager he was drawing for his weekly paper in Rego Park, Queens, and publishing his own magazine, Blasé) and deep immersion in the history and lore of comics. He had another asset: a case of uncorrectable ambylopia, or lazy eye, that makes if difficult for him to see in three dimensions. (''So cartoons really did seem real to me,'' he says. ''Maybe more real.'') After dropping out of SUNY Binghamton, he went to work for the Topps bubble-gum company, of all places, which had a small art and design department.

For as long as anyone can remember, MOMA has opened the permanent collection of painting and sculpture with its most famous work by Cézanne, ''The Bather,'' on a freestanding panel wall opposite the doorway. The rationale for that choice is impeccable. Picasso and Matisse, the twin deities of 20th-century art, each bowed to this one great forerunner, Cézanne. ''The father of us all,'' Picasso said. ''A sort of god of painting,'' according to Matisse. In 1929, Barr devoted his first exhibition at the museum to the four Post-Impressionist titans: van Gogh, Gauguin, Seurat and Cézanne. In the catalog, the new director declared that Cézanne's ''influence during the last 30 years is comparable in extent to that of Giotto, Roger van der Weyden, Donatello or Michelangelo.'' On the occasion of the museum's fifth-anniversary show, Barr reaffirmed that Cézanne dominated ''the painting of our period.''

Some 40 years ago, when Michelangelo Antonioni was the subject of adult conversation and mainstream debate, a film like ''Woman Is the Future of Man'' would have easily slipped into a New York art house. Mr. Hong is not yet the equal of Mr. Antonioni, but the greater point is that it has become increasingly difficult to see intellectually stimulating, aesthetically bold films like this in American theaters. None of Mr. Hong's previous features secured a theatrical release here, and this new film may experience a similarly unhappy fate, which is reason for every true movie lover to head to the New York Film Festival, where ''Woman Is the Future'' will show today and tomorrow.

A product of years of negotiation, the show brings together more than 100 works, 81 of them by Raphael. No such ambitious exhibition of the artist's work has previously been staged outside Italy, and it will not travel. ''Raphael From Urbino to Rome'' traces his artistic development from his fresh earliest works under the tutelage of his father, the painter Giovanni Santi, and the influence of the Umbrian masters Perugino and Pintoricchio, through his time in Florence, where he went in 1504 to study the works of masters like Leonardo and Michelangelo, to the flowering of his talent when he moved to Rome to work for Pope Julius II (above, painted by Raphael).

This exhibition follows Raphael up to the transforming moment of the unveiling of Michelangelo's Sistine ceiling -- it gives us mostly Raphael of the ''beautiful Madonnas.'' This is the Raphael Hawthorne had in mind when he extolled the purity of Raphael, the one Ruskin loved for his propriety and charm, the one of the beatific Virgins and cherubic babies reproduced on billions of postcards and biscuit tins.

Leonardo was all about ambiguity and difficulty, about celebrating a restless, messy mind; Michelangelo was about quicksilver inspiration and heroic effort, the cult of his own genius. A Michelangelo drawing in the Raphael show, the great one of the seated man turning around, virtually leaps off the wall next to Raphael's decorous efforts: it's all flesh and sex. With the exception of his ''Veiled Lady,'' Raphael, as a young painter of Madonnas, clearly suppressed what was his true response to women and dutifully replaced sex with sweet piety. He became the ultimate red state painter.

If the host is swank enough, the goodies can be fabulous, so while ''Premieres'' wants for an interesting or at least a transparent organizing principle, it doesn't lack for good and even sublime movies.

That Leonardo and Michelangelo should have known each other is one of history's breathtaking little miracles. Late in his career Leonardo, nearly a quarter-century older, was influenced by Michelangelo, as Nicholl concedes. But it's no good merely classifying Michelangelo as another of Florence's ''gay artists.'' The dominating fact about Michelangelo's sexuality is surely that he was chaste -- not at all like Leonardo. Nicholl's weird assertion that Michelangelo's ''Last Judgment'' is on the Sistine Chapel ceiling might suggest he is ignorant of a thing every undergraduate art student knows: ''The Last Judgment'' is on the altar wall. But this is hard to believe. More likely, Nicholl's brain stays in neutral when he discusses Michelangelo.

nyt_corpus_2004.har/12/12/1634013.xml	        That this exhibition should attract crowds is no surprise: the admiration previous generations lavished on Michelangelo, Rembrandt and El Greco is now directed at Caravaggio, the first and most audacious realist in European art. He would have both savored and dismissed the adulation, for seldom has there been such a conflicted artist. He was the consummate outsider. Indeed, he built his reputation in Rome by staking out polemical positions calculated to enrage the artistic establishment and endear him to sophisticated, largely ecclesiastical collectors.
nyt_corpus_2004.har/12/12/1634013.xml	        In 1576, El Greco was hounded out of town (or so we are told) for suggesting that Michelangelo, though a great sculptor, could not paint. But when Caravaggio arrived 16 years later, he did not simply thumb his nose at the worshippers of Michelangelo; he took on the whole premise of Renaissance painting. His bohemian, quasi-criminal life style -- late nights in taverns and frequent brawls -- seemed a head-on attack on the social status that artists had fought so hard to gain. And by rejecting the hierarchies that prized figurative painting over landscape and still life, and the beau ideal over naturalism, he called into question the very basis of Renaissance poetics.
nyt_corpus_2004.har/12/12/1634013.xml	        That Caravaggio's Roman paintings exert such a broad appeal today is the result of their sensational use of naturalistic effects: a basket of blemished fruit precariously posed on the edge of a table, a figure screaming as his head is severed, pretty boys flaunting their nudity. In Caravaggio's hands, naturalism -- painting directly from a posed model rather than working through the idealizing process of drawing -- became a weapon of attack, a means of undermining the critical standards of his day. Michelangelo had astounded the world with his heroic male nudes on the Sistine ceiling, and in his first public commission Caravaggio framed the martyrdom of Saint Matthew with shockingly naturalistic male nudes, two of whom watch the murder with disturbing detachment. (Scholars sometimes explain these figures as neophytes waiting to be baptized, but this seems to me a misunderstanding of the transgressive genius of Caravaggio, whom one contemporary pointedly called ''that anti-Michelangelo.'')
nyt_corpus_2004.har/12/12/1634013.xml	        For most admirers, Caravaggio's career pretty much ends in 1606, when he killed a tennis opponent and fled Rome. After spending some time on the estates of the Colonna family, south of Rome, he made his way to Naples, Malta and Sicily, and then back to Naples, where one of his many enemies slashed his face and a rumor circulated that he had been killed. (He made a point of offending people wherever he went.) These years, during which he awaited a papal pardon so that he could return to Rome, were a period of exile, but they were also a liberating experience. In Rome, Caravaggio had necessarily to do battle with the ghosts of Michelangelo and Raphael, as well as the legacy of Greek and Roman art. They were the measures by which art was judged. But in Naples, Malta and Sicily, there was no such dominant tradition. Caravaggio was the biggest act in town, and the finest commissions were offered to him.

Months after a painstaking and expensive cleanup of the 500-year-old nude figure, the museum found that dust and humidity brought in by visitors had begun to tarnish the statue again. ''The tourists carry in heaps of dust from outside,'' the museum director, Franca Falletti, told Reuters. ''Dust may sound innocent, but the city grime contains lots of chemicals. They also bring in humidity when it's raining.'' A possible solution, Ms. Falletti said, was to have air blowing out from behind the 15-foot statue, reversing an existing draft in the museum that allows dust to settle on the marble. The museum's other options include another wash for David and asking tourists to brush off rigorously before entering the museum.

Twisting he-men disport around the thick trunk of a phallic tree. Like Michelangelo, Rubens devised ever more complex ways of drawing figures: his ''Susanna'' is a coiled spring, her right leg positioned back to us, hips turned 45 degrees, shoulders turned farther around, head even more so, so that she looks behind her at one of the spying elders, whom we can see obliquely, from the side and below.

(Memorabilia commemorating both phenomena are widely available in town.) Things began to change in 1971, when the Minimalist artist Donald Judd sought a refuge from New York in more open Western territory and settled on Marfa as a congenial locale. Judd -- who, I am hardly the first to note, was very acquisitive for a so-called Minimalist -- went on intermittent real estate binges, so that by the time he died in 1994, he presided over most of the mothballed military base, Fort D.A. Russell, and the majority of the boarded-up buildings in town. He transformed the property into exhibition spaces for both his own work and that of artists he admired. ''Too often, I believe, the meaning of a work of art is lost as a result of thoughtless or unsuitable placement of the work for display,'' he wrote three years before his death. He felt that, if possible, art should be installed permanently, as was done in Renaissance churches. With the help of the Dia Foundation, he began the project of becoming both the Medici and the Michelangelo of Marfa. When Dia encountered financial difficulties in 1985 and tried to curtail its commitment, Judd threatened to sue.

Yet, every now and again, sparks fly from the odd encounter. Among the oddest -- it surely burst into the purest flame -- was one between Johann Sebastian Bach and Frederick the Great of Prussia.

nyt_corpus_2005.har/04/18/1665868.xml	        A scholar has suggested that ''Laocoön,'' a fabled sculpture whose unearthing in 1506 has deeply influenced thinking about the ancient Greeks and the nature of the visual arts, may well be a Renaissance forgery -- possibly by Michelangelo himself.
nyt_corpus_2005.har/04/18/1665868.xml	        The scholar advancing the theory, Lynn Catterson, a summer lecturer in art history at Columbia University, presented her argument in a talk at the university's Italian Academy for Advanced Studies in America on April 6. Maneuvering through a wealth of material -- including Michelangelo's drawings, records of his banking activity and his acknowledged reputation as an avid seeker of renown and wealth -- she said, ''He had the motives and the means.''
nyt_corpus_2005.har/04/18/1665868.xml	        In a telephone interview, Dr. Catterson cited a pen study by Michelangelo dating from 1501 depicting the rear of a male torso that resembles the back of the ''Laocoön'' -- and Michelangelo's documented finesse at copying.
nyt_corpus_2005.har/04/18/1665868.xml	        ''That the Laocoön was carved by Michelangelo explains why then, and why now, its effect is mesmerizing,'' she said.
nyt_corpus_2005.har/04/18/1665868.xml	        Some scholars have also found fault in relating the ''Laocoön'' to the Michelangelo drawing of a torso, now at the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford.
nyt_corpus_2005.har/04/18/1665868.xml	        ''To my eye, the Michelangelo drawing does not bear a close resemblance to the torso of the Vatican Laocoön,'' said Katherine E. Welch, an associate professor at New York University's Institute of Fine Arts and an expert in Hellenistic and Roman imperial antiquities, in an e-mail message. ''The latter is distinguished by a vigorous torsion or twist, which is lacking in the drawing.''
nyt_corpus_2005.har/04/18/1665868.xml	        The ''Laocoön'' was placed at the Vatican Museums by Pope Julius II not long after it was discovered on Jan. 14, 1506, on the Esquiline Hill. Upon hearing the news, the pope immediately dispatched the architect Giuliano da Sangallo to view it; Sangallo brought along his colleague Michelangelo Buonarroti. The men identified the statue as that described by the first-century Roman encyclopedist Pliny the Elder in his ''Natural History,'' who called it ''a work superior to any painting and any bronze,'' one ''carved from a single block in accordance with an agreed plan by those eminent craftsmen Hagesander, Polydorus and Athenodorus, all of Rhodes.''
nyt_corpus_2005.har/04/18/1665868.xml	        Dr. Catterson, 48, said she did not set out to debunk scholarship on the ''Laocoön'' when she settled on a dissertation topic seven years ago: ''How come Michelangelo was a sculptor? Who trained him?''
nyt_corpus_2005.har/04/18/1665868.xml	        Her curiosity was soon aroused. As a young artist under the patronage of Lorenzo the Magnificent, Michelangelo had witnessed the Medici family's willingness to spend considerable sums on ancient Greek or Roman objects, which he would have had ample opportunity to study and perhaps try to recreate, she said.
nyt_corpus_2005.har/04/18/1665868.xml	        Then there was recent scholarship on bank withdrawals and deposits between 1498 and 1501 that suggests that the sculptor was buying chunks of marble while accumulating substantial income that could not be accounted for, Dr. Catterson said, and several letters from Michelangelo to his father that spoke of some marbles but failed to explain how he was using the others.
nyt_corpus_2005.har/04/18/1665868.xml	        Dr. Catterson suggests that Michelangelo, a manic worker who carved on as few as three hours of sleep a night, would have had the time to create the ''Laocoön'' while working simultaneously on the ''Pietà,'' for which he signed a contract in 1498 and which he completed by July 1500.
nyt_corpus_2005.har/04/18/1665868.xml	        That the ''Laocoön'' is made of seven pieces of marble may suggest that Michelangelo needed to transport the finished work unnoticed to its point of discovery, where it could have been assembled and joined on the spot, Dr. Catterson added.
nyt_corpus_2005.har/04/18/1665868.xml	        William E. Wallace, a professor of art history at Washington University in St. Louis and the author of several books on Michelangelo, was not as quick as other art historians to dismiss Dr. Catterson's claims.
nyt_corpus_2005.har/04/18/1665868.xml	        ''Until I read the full argument in a reputable academic publication, I'm going to reserve a final judgment,'' he said, noting that since 1996, 17 discoveries of or attributions to Michelangelo have made national news -- and then been discredited or forgotten. ''My first reaction was: 'Oh, come on. Not another.' However, the more I thought about it, the more intrigued I became. I think this one has the greatest lasting power.''
nyt_corpus_2005.har/04/18/1665868.xml	        But to Leo Steinberg, a prominent Michelangelo scholar, the evidence simply does not add up -- neither the time nor the bank receipts nor the secretiveness. ''We know that at least a dozen different people would have been involved in the process,'' he said. ''And we know that Michelangelo made many enemies who would have been delighted to accuse him of a forgery of that scale. All of this strains credulity that in an Italian community at that time in the 1490's, there was no gossip, no squealing.''

The work is drier, but more subtly psychological. The monarchs are gone and we are directly implicated. The photographs are concerned with space: emotional, architectural and implied. They show people looking at a sculpture outside the picture -- Michelangelo's monumental David in the Gallerie Dell' Accademia in Florence, which appears only in miniature, reflected in a few tourists' eyeglasses.

Much of the deceptively simple work that his company created could be classified under Brook's famous category of ''holy theater'' -- one of spiritual intent that seeks to reveal the hidden aspects of life. Often these productions were performed on a nearly bare stage with little more than a few carpets as scenery. Perhaps influenced by Brook's lifelong fascination with Gurdjieff, the results were often revelatory, provocative, even mystical, as in a stripped-down production of ''Carmen,'' but with the exception of the epic ''Mahabharata,'' none equaled the grandeur or spectacle of Brook's earlier work. His minimalist approaches to classics may disappoint those who still await another ''Dream,'' but the austerity and spirituality might be seen as not unlike Beethoven's later quartets or the near-mystical late work of Michelangelo.

Along with James Stirling's history-faculty building at Cambridge and the London Zoo aviary, in Regent's Park, the Economist Group, as we all called it, was among the most highly publicized designs of the 1960's. The complex even had a bit part in the decade's coolest movie, Michelangelo Antonioni's ''Blow-Up.'' Unquestionably the most photogenic symbol of Italian alienation to be found in all of London, the Economist buildings appear in the movie's opening scene as the backdrop for a careering truckload of mute protesting mimes.

Michelangelo's ''David'' embodies the Renaissance conviction that the human form was a divine creation and the apex of beauty.

And the Chrysler Building embodies, as no other building does, the America of the 1920's.

nyt_corpus_2005.har/06/03/1677245.xml	        Paolo Sorrentino's film ''The Consequences of Love'' is set mostly in a Swiss luxury hotel where its poker-faced, 50-year-old protagonist and narrator, Tita (Tony Servillo), an accountant for the Mafia, has lived for years. The eeriest scenes of the film, which won five David di Donatello Awards (including best film, best director and best actor), show Tita supervising a room filled with workers grimly counting untold millions of dollars by hand. Why not do it electronically, one asks? Tita says he prefers the human touch. He is a kind of super gambler held virtual prisoner there because of a costly mistake he made years earlier. In the film, he makes one last life-and-death bluff for a woman. What makes ''The Consequences of Love'' (with Adriano Giannini, above left, and Olivia Magnani) more than a cerebral thriller is the metaphysical weight of Tita's self-knowledge. In a world where money rules more than ever, he is an existential fatalist for the 21st century. ''Consequences,'' which has two screenings today at the Walter Reade Theater, is one of the deeper films in ''Open Roads: The New Italian Cinema,'' the Film Society of Lincoln Center's annual Italian film series, which continues through Thursday. It shares with many of this year's films a visual fascination with the outer limits of modernity. That fascination links it to such Italian films of the 1960's as Michelangelo Antonioni's ''Eclipse.'' In Renato De Maria's ''Love Me,'' Isabella Ferrari plays a beautiful 35-year-old woman, married at 15, who explores her own sexual power after her husband of 20 years leaves her. As she drifts through a world of elegant nightclubs and hotels in one close encounter after another, she suggests a reversal of the alienated neurotic beauty once played by Monica Vitti; she blooms. ''Love Me'' has screenings tomorrow and Wednesday. (Walter Reade, (212)875-5600.)

But the main point is that as a gay man with a perfectionist bent who cited as formative his Roman Catholic upbringing and his fascination with the sideshow freaks at Coney Island, Mapplethorpe connected to a tradition of Classically inspired body-oriented art that began in earnest with Leonardo and Michelangelo.

But soon I was surprised to find myself responding -- and feeling most sympathetic where my initial chuckles had sometimes been loudest. The least slick, most homespun places turned out to be the most spiritually authentic expressions of faith. Mr. Rice's Cross Garden, Pastor Greene's ark and Brother Zoettl's tiny Rome were landscapes of the heart and soul, welcoming the drive-by stranger by revealing very personal religious feeling in an open and vulnerable way. By contrast, the giant Ten Commandments seemed imperious and gaudy. And the Holy Land Experience in Orlando, Fla., the closest thing to a full-fledged religious theme park that we visited, was staged and insular -- and far too coy about its principal mission of promoting its particular brand of end-times ideology. Perhaps the biggest surprise was Precious Moments Chapel in Carthage, Mo., a pilgrimage destination for fans of those porcelain figurines of angelic children with oversized heads and wide-set, teardrop-shaped eyes. Sam Butcher, the creator of Precious Moments, covered the walls and ceilings of the chapel with winged angels and biblical scenes, but in a startling departure from Michelangelo, all of the figures were Precious Moments characters.

nyt_corpus_2005.har/07/24/1689420.xml	        The center of ''The Third Hour of the Night'' is an extended monologue for Benvenuto Cellini, the Florentine goldsmith and sculptor, a contemporary of Michelangelo. Cellini fights to create in his art an ''equilibrium of ferocious, contradictory / forces,'' a ''balance or poise'' that is a version of what we all fight for on the conveyor belt of mortality. But Bidart is less concerned with a formally achieved ''poise'' than with those ''ferocious'' forces. As Cellini narrates his murder of the man who had murdered his brother, Bidart wants us to connect the bloody dagger and the sculptor's knife. When Cellini battles circumstance and the will of his patron to complete his masterpiece, the bronze statue of Perseus with the severed head of Medusa, he himself is a mythic warrior.

In part, it may reflect our growing awareness of the disorder and its milder cousin, Asperger Syndrome. Critics seeking to diagnose literary icons may also be taking the current vogue for finding autism in dead geniuses -- Michelangelo, Wittgenstein -- to its logical conclusion. Given these trends, it's not surprising that the wave of fascination with neurological quirks has also touched contemporary literature. Over the past decade or so, novelists and short-story writers in various markets -- from genre authors to writers of young adult fiction to avant-garde experimentalists -- have all created characters who could be labeled autistic.

Consider the episode of the fried artichokes. The whole thing sounds like a joke. Caravaggio had ordered eight artichokes for lunch, four fried in oil and the rest in butter. When the artichokes arrived at his table, Caravaggio asked which ones were fried in oil. The waiter suggested, not unreasonably, that he smell them. Instead, Caravaggio threw the whole plate of artichokes in the waiter's face and reached for a sword. It's one thing to throw artichokes at waiters and quite another to throw rocks at police officers -- Caravaggio's next offense, according to the Roman police logs. And then there was the little matter of the tennis game gone awry. We all know that tennis can be frustrating, but Caravaggio's game ended with the murder of his opponent.

nyt_corpus_2005.har/10/07/1707780.xml	        For the last few decades Michelangelo Antonioni's 1975 existential thriller has been all but inaccessible to the general public, available chiefly as a crummy home-video rental. Written by Mr. Antonioni, Mark Peploe and the film theorist Peter Wollen, ''The Passenger'' centers on a British journalist, David Locke, who one desultory day in Africa, trades his life for that of a dead man. Also titled ''Profession: Reporter,'' the film stars Jack Nicholson, then at the height of his creative powers and erotic appeal, a breathtaking Maria Schneider and one haunting Antonioni landscape after another. ''There was an accident,'' Locke said. ''Everyone thought I was dead. And I let them think it.''

Meanwhile, his birth mother (BONNIE HUNT) is tormented by her inability to find him. The film takes a nondogmatic view of the delicate tissue of family relations and treats each perspective with compassion.

nyt_corpus_2005.har/11/06/1715174.xml	        THE human body's largest organ is its skin: at an average of around 20 square feet, an ample if challenging canvas for the tattoo artists who, in Sarah Hall's new novel, make this piercing and inking a kind of birth rite for selfhood. The best of them ''bestowed uncompromising communication upon the world'' and ''caught the echo of a person and engraved it on to them.'' Once 14-year-old Cyril Parks -- the future Electric Michelangelo of the title -- apprentices himself to one of these ''scrapers,'' he'll spend the rest of his life working with the human body in all its pain and flux, wiping blood away as he inscribes pictures that both sum up and inspire his customers' lives.
nyt_corpus_2005.har/11/06/1715174.xml	        In an explanatory note, Hall remarks that tattooing doesn't feature much in literature. When it does appear, body art seems to invite a certain narrative gimmickry: in the frame narrative for Ray Bradbury's collection ''The Illustrated Man,'' for example, a man is covered in tattoos that come magically alive, each picture telling a tightly plotted, thrilling story. Hall may hint at a similar device in ''Electric Michelangelo'' -- Cyril is good at guessing which of his stock ''flashes'' a customer will choose -- but her novel is more about images than plot.
nyt_corpus_2005.har/11/06/1715174.xml	        True art is mysterious because an overall effect is greater than the sum of individual elements. The way to read ''The Electric Michelangelo,'' then, is to put aside quibbles about plot and allow the language and imagery to sweep you up. The best moments are like this glimpse of the aurora borealis over Morecambe Bay: ''It was light that had neither the impatience of fire, nor the snap of electricity, nor the fluttering sway of a candle. It was light that was nature's grace, unhurried, the slowest, seeping effulgence.'' Like that mysterious light, Hall's novel is to be admired for its own slow grace.

nyt_corpus_2005.har/11/13/1716977.xml	        Historians take windows where they can find them, and in certain circles this entry from a 17th-century ledger bears particularly vivid witness: On Jan. 2, 1603, a Roman nobleman named Ciriaco Mattei paid 125 scudi -- the liras of the day -- for what his bookkeeper described as ''a painting with its frame of Christ taken in the garden.'' The artist in question, Michelangelo Merisi, known to most of us as Caravaggio (after his hometown outside Milan), was then among the most famous, innovative and copied painters in Rome -- the Picasso of his day, more or less. But tastes change, and the realism that was bracing and revelatory to his contemporaries left a bad odor in the 18th and 19th centuries. By the turn of the last one Caravaggio had become but a footnote in art history. And so, another window: on April 16, 1921, according to the notation on a catalog from a now defunct auction house, ''The Taking of Christ,'' misattributed at the time to a minor Dutch painter, was sold at auction in Edinburgh, for a mere eight guineas, a silk purse pawned off as a pig's ear.

nyt_corpus_2005.har/11/20/1718937.xml	        More recently, however, the work was attributed by a Renaissance scholar to Giovanni Francesco Susini, an Italian artist who worked roughly a century after Michelangelo and is better known for his small bronzes. The scholar, Francesco Caglioti, compared the rare marble sculpture to ''Bacchus and a Young Satyr,'' a sculpture signed by Susini that is now in the Louvre.

Susini was one of the last Florentine sculptors to embrace the classical themes favored by literary academies supported by the Medicis in the 16th century. And that may explain why his work was so readily mistaken for Michelangelo's.

And then there were ''The Tales of Hoffmann'' (1951) directed by Michael Powell; Akira Kurosawa's ''Ran'' (1985); Robert Bresson's indispensible ''Pickpocket'' (1959, on a disc that also included Babette Mangolte's fascinating documentary, ''The Models of 'Pickpocket' ''); Kenji Mizoguchi's ''Ugetsu'' (1953); ''Le Samourai'' (1967) by Jean-Pierre Melville; ''The Flowers of St. Francis'' (1950) by Roberto Rossellini; Michelangelo Antonioni's sublime ''L'Eclisse'' (1962); and Jules Dassin's 1950 ''Night and the City'' (1950). All this, and boxed sets for John Cassavetes (eight discs), Andrej Wajda's ''war trilogy'' and four overlooked Japanese swordplay films packaged as ''Rebel Samurai.''

nyt_corpus_2006.har/02/07/1737811.xml	        Largely silent, with the exception of some choral music by Palestrina that rises slowly during the film's last five minutes, ''Eye to Eye'' depicts the 93-year-old Italian filmmaker (effectively rendered mute by a stroke in 1985) as he pays a visit to a work by another Michelangelo: the sculptor's marble statue of Moses, created for the tomb of Pope Julius II. No words are pronounced, and none need to be as Mr. Antonioni's slowly moving camera caresses the curves and textures of the monumental artwork while it closes in on his own aging, almost translucent flesh. Crosscutting between his own clouded eyes and the frozen, eternal regard of the sculpture, the director establishes a dialogue across time. The artist ages; the art does not.

nyt_corpus_2006.har/02/19/1740720.xml	        It is surprising, then, to learn that at 78, the Spanish painter Francisco de Goya (1746-1828) began making freestyle tableaus on small ivory flats usually used for miniatures. He did this by blackening the ivory, dropping water on the surface and shaping the resulting smears into faces and torsos. What emerged were Goyas as distinct in style and content as any of his paintings or prints, except that these appear to be illuminated from the inside. Instead of applying paint to a surface, Goya seemingly conjured these images from within, much as Michelangelo ''released'' the figure from a slab of marble.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/02/19/1740991.xml	        Italy opened Rodin's eye to the possibilities of realistic modeling. Michelangelo's sculptures, in particular, convinced him that the static, smooth, idealized purity of contemporary academic sculpture lacked life and truth. He returned to Paris and, in 1878, he exhibited his first major work, ''The Age of Bronze,'' modeled 1876, a reduced version of which is on display here. Its intense realism caused a sensation.

nyt_corpus_2006.har/02/24/1741976.xml	        An elderly parishioner's confession of a youthful prank to a parish priest may have led to the discovery of a Michelangelo fresco on the wall of a church in the village of Marcialla in the Chianti region of Italy. For centuries, town legend has said that the fresco above the altar (detail below) was painted by Michelangelo in his youth, and that claim has been mentioned in scholarly texts. The Guardian of London reported yesterday that the priest, the Rev. Rosario Palumbo, was told by the unidentified parishioner that as an altar boy, he had glimpsed the intertwined initials M, B and F, believed to stand for Michelangelo Buonarroti and either fecit (the Latin for ''did,'' as in ''did it'') or fiorentino, the Florentine. Father Palumbo decided to investigate. The Guardian reported that late last year, a stone slab forming part of the altar was heaved aside to provide evidence. Elsa Masi, a retired chemist who leads a local cultural organization, said the letters M and B were ''exactly the same'' as in lettering above a crucifix attributed to Michelangelo in the Church of Santo Spirito in Florence. The Guardian said verification of the attribution of the fresco would be difficult because its central portion had been damaged by dampness and painted over.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/02/26/1742436.xml	        Lucy Ellmann says she resents and fears Christianity because of, among other reasons, ''its deadening effect on the imagination.''Last time I checked, Christianity was the inspiration for 2,000 years of painting, sculpture, architecture, literature and music. Fra Angelico, Michelangelo, da Vinci, Raphael, Titian, Dante, Goethe, Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Donne, Milton, Beethoven and Bach are just a few of the multitudes of artists who have expressed Christian themes, motifs and ideas in their work. Even Philip Pullman, an atheist who loathes the church, has mined Christian theology to produce his fantastic trilogy, ''His Dark Materials.'' One may like or dislike Christianity, but to say it has deadened human imagination seems mistaken.

In one sense, these works were a reaction against the rationalism of the Enlightenment; in another, they represented a search for a uniquely British mythology.

nyt_corpus_2006.har/03/20/1748354.xml	        An exhibition of drawings by Michelangelo has broken the British Museum's record for advance sales, with more than 10,000 tickets sold, the BBC reported. ''Michelangelo Drawings: Closer to the Master,'' which opens on Thursday and has 90 drawings from the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, the Teylers Museum in the Netherlands and the British Museum's own collection, has far overtaken the museum's previous record holder, ''Forgotten Empire: The World of Ancient Persia,'' which sold 3,670 tickets before it opened last year. Hugo Chapman, a curator, said that Michelangelo, who destroyed many of his drawings, would have hated the exhibition. ''He wouldn't have wanted us to understand how he worked,'' Mr. Chapman said. ''He wanted us to go into the Sistine Chapel and be amazed.'' The show includes black-and-white chalk studies for ''The Last Judgment'' on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel, and images of the Crucifixion, along with drawings Michelangelo used for teaching students.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/03/29/1750376.xml	        ''Michelangelo Drawings: Closer to the Master,'' now at the British Museum through June 25, taps the museum's fine collection as well as those of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, England, and the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, the Netherlands, to trace six decades of Michelangelo's genius. The very fragility of the drawings, some more than 500 years old, justifies the museum's contention that this is a ''once-in-a-lifetime'' opportunity to see them.

nyt_corpus_2006.har/03/29/1750394.xml	        The British Museum's acclaimed new show of Michelangelo drawings is an invitation to voyeurism, albeit not, as may be supposed, because of the Florentine master's undisguised worship of the naked male body. Rather, it is because Michelangelo never intended his drawings to be seen by eyes other than his own or those of his family and pupils.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/03/29/1750394.xml	        Michelangelo believed sculpture to be the supreme art, followed by painting and architecture. And he proved his genius in all three art forms -- with the marble masterpieces ''Pietà'' and ''David,'' with the Sistine Chapel and with the dome of St. Peter's in Rome. In contrast, drawings served him merely as tools for preparing these and other monumental works.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/03/29/1750394.xml	        He had two good reasons not to share these ''notes,'' although it is not known which -- if either -- was the real motive for his secrecy: he may have wanted to hide evidence of the considerable effort that went into his art, or he may have feared that the revolutionary ideas in his drawings would be plagiarized. Certainly, Michelangelo was determined to preserve his aura.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/03/29/1750394.xml	        In that sense, then, ''Michelangelo Drawings: Closer to the Master,'' which runs here through June 25, achieves what the artist apparently hoped to avoid: by displaying 90 of the 600 or so surviving sheets of drawings and sketches, the show provides remarkable insight into the way he worked over a career lasting more than six decades.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/03/29/1750394.xml	        To this end, the British Museum has united its Michelangelo drawings with those of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford and the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, the Netherlands, where the exhibition was first presented. The show does not include works from the Queen's Collection or the Courtauld Institute of Art, however, because, Mr. Chapman noted, its purpose was not to recreate the last major Michelangelo drawings exhibition here in 1975.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/03/29/1750394.xml	        The results have won near-unanimous praise from British art critics, with only Richard Dorment recalling in The Daily Telegraph that some Renaissance experts still question whether as many as 600 or so drawings can in fact be attributed to Michelangelo. Other critics, though, have hailed the show as, in the words of Charles Derwent in The Independent on Sunday, ''unmissable.''
nyt_corpus_2006.har/03/29/1750394.xml	        Writing in The Financial Times, Jackie Wullschlager went still further: ''For me, the show makes the artist known even during his lifetime as 'the divine Michelangelo' poignantly, achingly, deeply human in all his brilliance, passion, doubt and terror, for the first time.''
nyt_corpus_2006.har/03/29/1750394.xml	        Michelangelo, it seems, never questioned the importance of ''disegno,'' the Italian word for both drawing and design, itself a central feature of Florentine art after paper became easily available in the 15th century. One drawing from the 1520's carries his instruction to a pupil: ''Draw Antonio, draw Antonio, draw and don't waste time.'' After seeing a work by Titian, he is also said to have lamented that Venetians never learned to draw.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/03/29/1750394.xml	        The exhibition is presented chronologically and, while no studies for ''Pietà'' or ''David'' have been found, surviving sketches for ''Bathers,'' Michelangelo's unfinished fresco of ''The Battle of Cascina,'' immediately illustrate his fascination with the male torso. With black chalk and white lead capturing the beauty and tension of twisting bodies, the effect is almost three-dimensional, as if even here Michelangelo were seeking out sculptural forms.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/03/29/1750394.xml	        But he would return to it more than two decades later to paint ''The Last Judgment.'' And here again, many studies have survived of the figures swirling across this giant fresco. Interestingly, only men are naked; and on the rare occasions when Michelangelo portrayed women, their muscularity -- and the often bizarre ''attachment'' of breasts -- suggests that he probably used men as models.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/03/29/1750394.xml	        Still, this show does not dwell on Michelangelo's sexuality and includes only one of the drawings that he dedicated to Tommaso de' Cavalieri, the young nobleman who was the object of his midlife infatuation. This work, ''The Fall of Phaeton,'' which depicts Phaeton falling to his death from a chariot, is thought to illustrate the destructive power of love.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/03/29/1750394.xml	        More striking, perhaps, is the passion of Michelangelo's late religious drawings. In ''The Lamentation,'' where Christ's inert body lies in his mother's arms, Mary looks away sadly while other anxious figures crowd around her. Then, climaxing the show, are three drawings of the Crucifixion. Beside them hangs the text of a sonnet in which the artist contemplates his own life and death with these closing words: ''Neither painting nor sculpture can any longer quieten/ my soul.''

Apart from providing a glimpse of how Milan's ruling aristocracy once lived (grandly), it's a real hodgepodge of a collection, from significant examples of Lombard paintings to a wacky ensemble of musical instruments.

I am lucky not to have crown moldings; if I did I would put them to work by painting them to match the wall, thus raising its height. Delicate panel moldings would be even better, tacked on the ceiling to create a narrow border. Then paint it the same color as the wall. Since dark colors can bring ceilings down, I started with Kilz2 Latex, a warm-white primer ($13.98 a gallon at Home Depot). Rather than skim and sand to a perfect finish, I experimented with an untinted Venetian plaster by Behr ($31.98 a gallon at the Home Depot). I thinned the plaster to the consistency of pancake batter, then applied it using a roller with a sea sponge cover, smoothing with a trowel. Once the plaster set, I polished it with 1,500-grit sandpaper and another pass of the trowel. After a solid week of the Michelangelo act, rough spots seemed to disappear, aided by the patchy shine of the plaster.

That brings me to what is not new: almost everything in the celebratory exhibition ''Masterworks From the Morgan,'' which fills every gallery. Regular visitors will spot old favorites, like the ninth-century Lindau Gospels cover, encrusted with agates that glow like nightlights; Dürer's pen-and-ink Adam and Eve; Michelangelo's smudgy sketchlets of David and Goliath; and a good-as-new Gutenberg Bible.

BAMcinématek, the repertory film program at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, is presenting an extensive series, ''The Vision That Changed Cinema: Michelangelo Antonioni,'' with 15 features and a number of shorts, all in new prints from Cinecittà. It begins on June 7 with a weeklong run of ''Blowup'' and includes the trilogy of ''L'Avventura,'' ''La Notte and ''L'Eclisse''; early films like ''Chronicle of a Love'' and ''Il Grido''; and a rare screening of ''Chung Kuo -- Cina,'' a three-part documentary about China made in 1972. The series runs through June 29.

''John Wayne was to Ford what David was to Michelangelo,'' the Ford biographer Joseph McBride once said. ''He was the ideal man, the masculine ideal.'' They'd met when Wayne (above left, with Ford, on the set of ''The Alamo'' in 1960) was a college student working as a prop man, and their friendship, forged over poker games in Ford's yacht, spanned 50 years and 14 films, three of them nominated for Oscars. This 90-minute documentary uses home movies, back-lot film footage and interviews to navigate one of Hollywood's most enduringly resonant relationships.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/05/19/1762728.xml	        Michelangelo, in his off-hours as poet and writer, had bitter words for God and his works. Shostakovich lent them a sympathetic ear more than 400 years later when, nearing death in 1974, he set his ''Suite on Words of Michelangelo.'' Dmitri Hvorostovsky, the Russian baritone, sang this cycle of 11 songs, with Ivari Ilja playing the piano, on Wednesday as part of a Russian evening at Avery Fisher Hall.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/05/19/1762728.xml	        A small but destructively enthusiastic part of Mr. Hvorostovsky's audience interrupted the intended continuity of the cycle by applauding after every song, leaving other listeners to make do with fragments instead of a continuing flow of mood. The individual titles are laconic: ''Truth,'' ''Love,'' ''Anger'' and the like. Michelangelo's unrequited religious ardor is interleaved with a reflection on his work, including hammer and chisel blows re-enacted by violent keyboard chords; various love poems; and a tribute to Dante.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/05/19/1762728.xml	        These are less songs with piano accompaniment than duets between voice and instrument, conversations that employ not only descriptive tone-painting in response to texts but also the composer's original ideas about what counterpoint should be. Mr. Ilja is a big man with an unusually prominent resonance to his piano sound, but there was deftness here as well. The final songs in ''Suite on Words of Michelangelo'' are of death and immortality. Enigmatic as ever, Shostakovich lets uplifting assertions on eternity trail away in chirping little repeated figures.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/05/21/1763196.xml	        IF they are known at all, the Apuans usually merit a footnote in the telling of Renaissance masters. While still a young man, Michelangelo kept a residence among the white stone quarries of Carrara. It was said he could see the face -- or at least the rough shape -- of his figures while looking at uncut walls of stone. The David was carved from a piece of Carrara marble and still today, quarry men from Carrara slice away marble and ship it around the world. The town has a gritty ambiance, with a cathedral built with the trademark local stone. Some of its quarries are open for touring. But this is no place for the mountain soul; the hills are deeply scarred, roaded with switchbacks and industrial. The heart of the Apuans is just over the crests, inland.

Vanessa Redgrave and David Hemmings star in the film, set squarely in swinging 60's London (the music! the fashions!), which tells the story of a fashion photographer who might have accidentally documented a murder.

nyt_corpus_2006.har/06/04/1766511.xml	        BROODING metaphysical mood music: that's one way to describe the poetic tone of the films of the Italian master Michelangelo Antonioni. The climate of romantic neurasthenia that seeps into his work is captured in ''Antonioni,'' a song by the great Brazilian songwriter Caetano Veloso: ''Visione del Silenzio/Angelo voto'' (''Vision of silence/Empty street corner''). The song goes on to evoke a page with no sentence, a letter written on a face and love as a ''useless window.'' Like the stories in Mr. Antonioni's films, the melody never quite lands. Plaintively crooned over a sighing bed of strings, it hovers in the air like an anxious, yearning spirit.

It depicts the head and the upper torso of an unidentified woman with one hand draped back over her head in a classic pose; those with some training in art history will no doubt recognize the pose from Michelangelo's sculpture ''Dying Slave'' (1513-16). But Man Ray has made the image startlingly modern, the solarization giving the figure a stark, clean, metallic quality. She looks as if she has been dipped in quicksilver.

The museum will remain open until midnight every Saturday until July 25, when the exhibition of 90 drawings, which has attracted more than 140,000 people since it opened in London at the end of March, is scheduled to close.

nyt_corpus_2006.har/06/11/1768239.xml	        ''Cars are the sculpture of everyday life,'' Mr. Bangle said; the Munich sculpture idealizes the profession. The marble came from a quarry near Carrara, Italy, where Michelangelo obtained the stone for his sculptures. The designers rolled up their sleeves and carved, giving the stone its final polishing by hand. There is a subtext to the piece as well: peeking from behind the marble, visible only at the sides, is an assemblage of real auto parts, like exhaust pipes and suspension struts. At last, the designers managed to push the engineers into the background.

Yet they seem as interested in ideas as in aesthetics.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/06/15/1769330.xml	        The old stereotype that British people, if they see a line forming, will immediately stand in it, has been getting some fresh reinforcement at the British Museum here where a blockbuster exhibition has been created around some relatively small works. The hubbub should be no surprise given that the artworks in question, however diminutive in scale, are by Michelangelo (1475-1564), an artist whose last solo engagement at this museum was some 30 years ago.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/06/15/1769330.xml	        Since "Michelangelo Drawings: Closer to the Master" opened in March, such has been the public enthusiasm that the British Museum has announced that it will keep the galleries open until 10 every night in the show's final week, June 18 through 25. Taking things another step or rather two hours further, on Saturday nights this month the exhibition remains open until midnight, taking the august institution into the city's lively nightlife realm for the first time.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/06/15/1769330.xml	        On these evenings, along with the stunning selection of 90 drawings by Michelangelo ranging from Annunciations, Crucifixions and lamentations to more than a few muscle-bound male figure studies the museum is also serving Italian antipasti, desserts and wines at special stands in the Great Court. For the next two weeks, dinner and a masterpiece will be a viable option to the more typical cinematic Saturday night date.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/06/15/1769330.xml	        In the galleries this past Saturday evening, Kate Williamson and Ben Tan, who had bought their tickets on the Internet the previous day, found the exhibition revelatory. "You tend to think of Michelangelo in terms of his finished buildings or sculptures," Mr. Tan said, "so it's amazing to see how his ideas evolved as he worked." Won over by the drawings, they thought the exhibition a refreshingly "nonalcohol-fueled way to spend an evening," as Mr. Tan put it, though as they headed out around 11:30 p.m., both agreed that a pint sounded pretty appealing.

She has also gotten good at delivering bad news with a gentle smile, especially when disillusioning those who think that Michelangelo is in any way linked to "The Da Vinci Code."
nyt_corpus_2006.har/06/15/1769330.xml	        Because of the small scale and delicate detail of the works, only about 200 people are permitted to enter the galleries each hour. With magnifying glasses available from the museum information desks, visitors often linger in the galleries for several hours in rapt contemplation of the drawings, many of which provide an almost behind-the-scenes glimpse into how Michelangelo's best-loved works, such as the "Creation of Adam" or "Last Judgment" from the Sistine Chapel, came about.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/06/15/1769330.xml	        Asked about the eleventh-hour ticket frenzy and the nearly magnetic pull of Michelangelo's drawings, the exhibition curator, Hugo Chapman, said that "with Michelangelo we typically have to go to him neither the Sistine Chapel nor his 'David' are likely to be coming to London anytime soon so this is a chance to see him both up close and in depth and that's not usually possible."
nyt_corpus_2006.har/06/15/1769330.xml	        Mr. Chapman said that after the dual demands of fielding importuning phone calls from "just about anybody who's ever sat next to me on a bus somewhere," and after the more academically arduous task of having to distill Michelangelo's enormously productive 60-year career down to 90 drawings, he was ready for a break.

nyt_corpus_2006.har/06/23/1771056.xml	        With Leonardo and Michelangelo he forms the Big Three of the High Renaissance. He was routinely called ''the prince of painters'' but was perhaps more like a Sun King: glowing, formidable yet benign. His pellucid light, majestic compositional sense, idealized figures and radiant palette imbued the new system of one-point perspective with clarity, repose and happiness. Few other Renaissance painters attained such gleaming, supple wholeness.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/06/23/1771056.xml	        His career was short and driven. The Colonna altarpiece, one of the last he painted, is a telling transitional work from an artist who was in a sense always in transition, always picking up ideas and making them his own. Commissioned by the Franciscan convent of St. Anthony of Padua in Perugia, Raphael's birthplace, it was completed when he was barely 21, already considered a master and in the process of relocating to Florence. He decamped four years later to Rome, the patronage of Pope Julius II and a stimulating rivalry with Michelangelo. In Rome, Raphael finally escaped both Christian themes and oil paint in his great frescoes for the Papal apartments. By 1520, at 37, he was dead; his tomb is in the Pantheon.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/06/23/1771056.xml	        And yet the central panel is another story: the sky is a white-to-blue fathomless space, and the thoughtful dignity, monumental stasis and sculptural yet solid-colored robes of Peter and Paul indicate an awareness of Michelangelo's latest innovations. In this panel especially, Raphael's light and space radiate with full force, and his colors dance. Saturated shades of red, yellow, blue and green rotate in changing pairs, among the robes and garments of the figures in the central panel and the small predella images.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/06/23/1771060.xml	        Mr. Jayasundara studied film in France and has probably watched his share of classic European art cinema. Although his influences may originate closer to home (in interviews he has name dropped the venerated Sri Lankan auteur Lester James Peries), his use of landscape to convey states of mind suggests that he has more than a passing acquaintance with the work of Michelangelo Antonioni. Like Mr. Antonioni, who once dyed grass in one of his films to underscore ''the sense of desolation, of death,'' Mr. Jayasundara uses color both to create an enveloping mood and to underscore the medium's plasticity. Given that Sri Lanka's horrific history could easily overwhelm even the boldest aesthetic voice, this expressionistic gambit seems as smart as it may be necessary.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/06/25/1771788.xml	        Artists have found inspiration even in the affairs of other artists. Rumor had it that Raphael, the amorous Renaissance master, discovered he couldn't create without his lover nearby. He installed her in a room at a Roman villa where he was painting frescoes so he could visit her whenever he required a creative jolt. Ingres was so fascinated by this liaison that he imagined it in ''Raphael and La Fornarina,'' with Raphael's muse seated on his lap; Picasso imagined their entanglements in a series of explicit drawings, with Raphael's rival Michelangelo watching.

It's no longer possible to look at a Yoruba voodoo object as purely functional, rather than also (perhaps) terrific looking, or to see a Michelangelo as merely beautiful, rather than also as a product of a moment, a society, a religious tradition. Even if it were possible, it would be terribly unfashionable.

His puppetlike characters are isolated in closed spaces (a cave, a cabin, a house trailer, even the sound-stage sets that stand in for nature at night), his distanced camera covering them in shifting, triangular compositions that reflect their fluid loyalties.

Francesco Buranelli, director of the museums, told the newspaper La Stampa that he ''would like very much to have a Picasso'' and plans acquisitions ''above all in sectors like contemporary art.''

And to judge from this 1779-80 self-portrait, in which he stands beside a bust of Michelangelo, wearing a Rembrandt-style beret and the gowns of an honorary doctor from Oxford, he was still desperate to impress the establishment.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/07/27/1778720.xml	        Other painters in the exhibition sought to inflate the stature of artists by glorifying past masters: Ingres with his ''Death of Leonardo da Vinci,'' Gustave Moreau with ''Giotto'' and Delacroix with ''Michelangelo in His Studio.''

As for how gay rumors begin in the first place, they can be triggered by just about anything -- a certain look, too many gay friends, being older and still romantically unattached. And more public figures are being put on the spot about their sexual orientation, something that was once considered in bad taste.

So it required a special request for him to take a portrait like the one of the designer Ann Demeulemeester on Page 242. ''Ann is not one of those faces you see every day in the media,'' he says. An original member of a revolutionary group of German landscape photographers known as the Becher School, Struth has since graduated to deadpan photos of street scenes in cities like Paris, Rome and Tokyo. In his revised 2005 book, ''Museum Photographs'' (Schirmer & Mosel), he captures viewers of masterpieces like Michelangelo's ''David,'' suggesting a relationship between photographic and artistic masterpieces.

Here we see the neighbor's teenage daughter going into Manhattan for an abortion, accompanied by the older of the two Keane daughters, who reads ''A Farewell to Arms'' in the waiting room. And up ahead, Pauline, Mary's old friend from her office days and the Keane family's honorary spinster aunt, is injured in a fall.

But this show, which comes a few months after an excellent exhibition of Michelangelo's drawings at the British Museum, also highlights how these two great artists differed in their approaches to works on paper.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/09/26/1792806.xml	        Michelangelo used drawings to prepare his paintings, sculptures and architecture, then ordered the papers' destruction as he was dying, as if the need for these studies diminished his genius. In contrast, drawing for Leonardo was both a tool of his scientific investigation and proof of his achievements: he protected his sheets of paper by binding them in notebooks.
nyt_corpus_2006.har/09/26/1792806.xml	        Still more strikingly, while Michelangelo captured the movement and muscularity of bodies, not least in his studies for the Sistine Chapel, Leonardo went literally inside bodies to learn how they worked. (At one point he remarks on the unpleasantness of dissecting corpses.)
nyt_corpus_2006.har/09/29/1793390.xml	        The exhibition benefits from certain side trips. One of its sections, devoted to Italy and antiquity, explores the rediscovery of Classical sculpture and its technical finesse. It includes several early Byzantine (or Eastern Roman Empire) marble portrait busts from the 4th and 5th centuries as well as some 13th-century works from southern Italy, also in marble, in which the sculptors head straight for the Renaissance without stopping at Gothic. Nicola di Bartolomeo da Foggia's lavishly turned-out ''Crowned Bust of a Woman'' of 1272 is a showstopper. There is also an even more appealing (if damaged) queenly head from the same decade, and a slightly earlier bust (1225-50) of Julius Caesar whose long, powerful neck and trim, compact jaw evoke Michelangelo's David.

We could use a few more heroes in art today, don't you think? Their absence partly accounts for Picasso's enduring aura. At the end of his ''Discourses,'' delivered as lectures at the Royal Academy in London, the 18th-century painter Joshua Reynolds, whose style couldn't have been farther from Michelangelo's, said what plenty of artists might now think about Picasso.

nyt_corpus_2006.har/12/03/1808852.xml	        Palladio's major commissions were ecclesiastical. His first completed project in Venice was the facade of an existing church, San Francesco della Vigna. While earlier architects had blended classical forms with Christian buildings, Palladio applied columns and pediments on the scale of classical temples to his facade designs, thus injecting some of their aura into Christian churches. With the great Benedictine monastery of San Giorgio and the later votive memorial of Il Redentore, the Redeemer, he achieved a sense of scale and monumentality rarely seen since antiquity. As Cooper notes, Palladio was guided in his religious architecture by the example of Michelangelo, who forged a language of greatness in Rome with St. Peter's and Santa Maria degli Angeli, which is carved out of the Baths of Diocletian. In Palladio's hands, these elements appear less willful and more astringently applied. Through his mastery of engineering and the classical orders, his Venetian churches became the Renaissance equivalent of Roman architecture. There is a logic and clarity to his buildings; component parts effortlessly interlock and moldings fold into one another, eased by his flair for detailing.

Pizza bianca means white pizza and is really denuded pizza -- like a firm, crispy focaccia gently kissed with oil, herbs and salt (1.40 euros for a snack-size portion). Take it into the Piazza Farnese, which is just a block from the hubbub of Campo de' Fiori but a world away in terms of serenity.

Still others, like Theo's wealthy cousin, Nigel (Danny Huston, equally fine), who's stashing away masterpieces like Michelangelo's ''David'' for safekeeping in his private museum while Rome, New York and probably Guernica burn, can only smile as they swill another glass of wine.

The sculptures here were made, however, in the London studio of Anthony Caro after Mr. Smith's death.

The men chat briefly, then join a third, younger man at a large dining table in front of Picasso's ''Guernica.''

This is a spirited account of the battle between France's officially sanctioned history painters and the upstarts contemptuously dismissed as Impressionists -- embodied, for King, in the opposing fortunes of Ernest Meissonier and Édouard Manet. King, author of ''Brunelleschi's Dome'' and ''Michelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling,'' colorfully describes the controversy that raged around the annual Paris Salons (juried exhibitions) of the 1860s and '70s, and the impact of historic events on cultural politics.

Its style and subject matter suggested early-16th-century Florence -- a date ultimately confirmed by thermoluminescent analysis. That was the high point of the Florentine Renaissance, when both Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, as well as the della Robbia family of master ceramic sculptors, were in their prime.

''We now know that Michelangelo definitely had a private space in the basilica,'' said Maria Cristina Carlo-Stella, who runs the Fabbrica di San Pietro, the office where the records of St. Peter's Basilica are kept. ''The next step is to identify it.''

Bare-breasted Helen, knocked over like a lamp in one corner, disappears amid a melee of archers and swords and big-rumped horses and teetering boats, the panorama sharply receding into a swarm of filigreed white-on-dark brushwork signifying distant skirmishes.

Until he sold the company in 2002, Mr. Klein pushed the envelope with provocative campaigns, securing a spot for his Calvins among the top five best-selling underwear brands, where they remain in spite of (or because of) a far tamer marketing strategy.

Going from the Greek and Roman galleries to the Picasso is something you can only do there. Willem de Kooning and Arshile Gorky used to haunt these galleries during the 1930s and '40s and loved the Pompeiian frescoes, whose influence you can see in their works, not far away.

At the same time, in no other city can one wander, with completely empty pockets, and see at least nine works by various Michelangelos -- among them the Pietà by the more famous Michelangelo and a number of sly paintings by the only slightly less renowned one, better known as Caravaggio.
nyt_corpus_2007.har/04/22/1841952.xml	        This free Michelangelo tour takes less than a day. And except for crowds at St. Peter's Basilica, which houses the Pietà, you would probably never even see a line.

nyt_corpus_2007.har/04/22/1841952.xml	        Not far from San Clemente is the basilica of St. Peter's in Chains. There sits Michelangelo Buonarroti's Moses, part of the massive tomb he famously never completed for Pope Julius II. Legend has it that Michelangelo struck the knee of his completed creation in stone, otherwise so lifelike, with a hammer.
nyt_corpus_2007.har/04/22/1841952.xml	        The church of Santa Maria Sopra Minerva, next to the Pantheon, houses what is considered a lesser sculpture of Christ by Michelangelo. Then there is, of course, St. Peter's Basilica, which on its own owes much to Michelangelo. (Unlike the Vatican Museums, entrance to the basilica is free.) Behind bulletproof glass (thanks to an attack on it in 1972) rests the Pietà, completed when the artist was just 24 years old.
nyt_corpus_2007.har/04/22/1841952.xml	        Less sought out, but no less deserving, are the six works by the man sometimes known as ''the other Michelangelo'' (the phrase is used as a chapter heading of a new entertaining meditation on Rome that tourists might consider, ''The Secrets of Rome,'' just published in English by Rizzoli). Michelangelo Merisi is usually known simply as Caravaggio (born a century after the other Michelangelo), and his paintings decorate churches in central Rome, including San Luigi dei Francesi, at Piazza San Luigi dei Francesi, near Piazza Navona, and the nearby Church of Sant'Agostino.

During the day, the Piazzale swarms with tourists, but in the evening, the cafes fill up with local residents who come to watch the sun dip over their city. While you're there, visit the San Miniato al Monte (via Monte alle Croci 34, 39-055-234-2731), an 11th-century church famed for its Romanesque architecture. Listen for the chants of the Benedictine monks during vespers.

Sensing that other films would also begin flouting the code and in turn create a vacuum into which local politicians and censorship boards might rush, Mr. Valenti decided to act.
nyt_corpus_2007.har/05/06/1845208.xml	        Worse, the chapter ends with a whiplash-inducing jump backward to the late 18th century of Rousseau and Goethe -- the crucible of youth-powered Romanticism that should have been front and center at the start. Given this book's sympathy to every modern glimmer of homosexuality, it is strange that there is no discussion of the ancient Greeks' glorification of youth, which was revived by Italian Renaissance artists like Donatello and Michelangelo.

nyt_corpus_2007.har/05/16/1847661.xml	        Every year, the festival gives moviegoers a ''gimme'' bag to facilitate the schlepping of its sundry guides, catalogs and promotional materials. This year's version is colorfully printed with dozens of names of past winners of the Palme d'Or, including luminaries of world cinema like Roman Polanski, Akira Kurosawa and Michelangelo Antonioni. But Cannes is traditionally a place of controversy as well as adulation. Mr. Antonioni was booed when he presented ''L'Avventura'' in 1960, and a gaudy piece of swag can provoke argumentative passion as surely as a jury's vote or an auteur's vision. ''Roland Joffe should not be here!'' Mr. Rissient said, with indignation. Welcome to Cannes.
nyt_corpus_2007.har/05/16/1847749.xml	        The case became synonymous with corporate excess after widely circulated reports that Mr. Kozlowski had used Tyco money for lavish parties, including one that featured an ice sculpture of Michelangelo's ''David'' dispensing vodka, and for furnishings for a Manhattan apartment, including a $6,000 shower curtain and a $15,000 umbrella stand.
nyt_corpus_2007.har/05/18/1848122.xml	        ''Michelangelo didn't repeat Bramante's drawings, and Bernini left his own imprint, too,'' Mr. Cavaglieri said.
nyt_corpus_2007.har/05/27/1850071.xml	        In some sense, Levi's endless theme is Freud's notion, in ''Civilization and Its Discontents,'' that man can stand neither repression nor the lifting of repression. Not having a divine idea of human nature, Levi was constantly exposing the fault lines of secular humanism -- he defended human dignity even as he developed a growing sense that the human animal was somehow indefensible. Despite many memoirs, he almost never wrote as a husband or father, though he was both, which further complicates our understanding of his vision of life. Though he has become a sort of secular saint, he can often seem like Michelangelo's Christ in ''The Last Judgment,'' turning away coldly from the saved even as he consigns the sinners to hell.
nyt_corpus_2007.har/05/29/1850670.xml	        James Beck, a Columbia University art historian who became well known as a critic of what he viewed as the ruinous conservation of world masterpieces, including Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling, died on Saturday in Manhattan. He was 77.
nyt_corpus_2007.har/05/29/1850670.xml	        An Italian Renaissance specialist, Mr. Beck produced 13 books, including three on Raphael and one about the sculptor Jacopo della Quercia, the subject of his doctoral dissertation. He wrote articles on painters from Giotto to Caravaggio, devoting particular attention to Michelangelo.
nyt_corpus_2007.har/05/29/1850670.xml	        He argued that the Michelangelo frescos were being drastically overcleaned -- a process that not only erased some of the subtle volumetric painting, he contended, but also exposed the entire surface to modern pollution.
nyt_corpus_2007.har/05/29/1850670.xml	        In 1992 he and the British journalist and artist Michael Daley founded ArtWatch International, a nonprofit advocacy organization to monitor the restoration, attribution and international shipment of works of art. Among its many campaigns was an unsuccessful effort in 2003 to prevent the cleaning of Michelangelo's ''David'' in Florence.
nyt_corpus_2007.har/06/03/1851615.xml	        ''Ingrid,'' Charlotte Chandler's chummy, unevenly anecdotal new ''personal biography'' of the actress, comes blessed by odd-couple endorsements from Michelangelo Antonioni and the late Sidney Sheldon. But don't get your hopes up for a dose of juicy estrangement or the glamorized ennui of a good scandalous ride on fame's R-rated roller coaster. ''Ingrid'' isn't that kind of book, for Chandler is the soul of circumspection when it comes to her subject's lesser flings or anything that smacks of salacious gossip.
nyt_corpus_2007.har/06/03/1851648.xml	        WHEN Roman soldiers founded Florence around 60 B.C., its original name was Florentia, meaning ''may she flourish.'' It may have taken some 1,500 years, but flourish she did -- becoming home and inspiration to Dante, Michelangelo and a lot of other really, really talented people. That's a source of pride for a city that clings to its history. Wander around, and you get the sense that Florentines never got the memo that Italy's capital moved south 140 years ago. That may explain its enduring appeal to legions of tourists and art-history majors. But the city's reputation as a tourist trap in Renaissance clothing may be undeserved. Florence still has the ability to surprise, with modern art, specialty shops and trendy bars. And with a half-dozen breathtaking gardens overlooking it all, not only is the city flourishing, it's in full bloom.

To see the artist's Pietà in Rome, you could wrestle the crowd and try to glimpse the top of Mary's head. Or you could visit the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (Piazza del Duomo, 9; 39-055-230-2885; www.operaduomo.firenze.it; 6 euros) and walk right up to the Pietà that Michelangelo carved just before his death. He never finished it (the woman on the left was completed by another artist). The museum, oddly empty and under the shadow of the duomo, also houses Donatello's masterpiece, Mary Magdalene, and the original baptistry door panels by Ghiberti.

This enormous palace has terraced gardens, majestic rooms with modern amenities and canopied beds -- not to mention that the facade was designed by Michelangelo. Weekend rates start at 840 euros.

Commanding the courtyard in front of the pavilion, it is two shallow circular reflecting pools, touching to form a figure eight. The pools, weighing 8 to 10 tons each, are made of solid pieces of Carrara marble, the same kind Michelangelo used. (They are the largest pieces taken intact from a particular quarry in northern Tuscany since 1523, according to the exhibition's stone supplier.)
nyt_corpus_2007.har/06/08/1852885.xml	        Johanna Billing's ''Project for the Revolution,'' a looping film of comely young people milling about, is a remake of a scene from Michelangelo Antonioni's 1970 ''Zabriskie Point,'' but with the radical politics left out, and, Ms. Billing seems to suggest, sorely missed.

Commercial success is part of his philosophy of art. ''There was a time when artists provided a real service,'' he said. ''Michelangelo is an installation guy. He built the architecture, painted the ceiling.''
nyt_corpus_2007.har/06/17/1854981.xml	        That's the advantage of being an emerging artist at 50. Mr. Somoroff may be just beginning his rise in the world of fine art, but ''Illumination'' isn't an early work, and it isn't an experiment. It's a fully formed artistic vision, articulated with a career's worth of visual and technical expertise. The art world may wince. But Michelangelo wouldn't.
