On the first pitch to him in the ninth, he hits a catchable foul pop off third base that the third baseman drops for an error. If Mattingly lines the next pitch for a single, does he extend his hitting streak or is it over because of the error? Without the error that extended Mattingly's turn at bat, there could be no hit to extend his streak. But the streak stays alive because it was the hit, not the error, that enabled Mattingly to reach first base safely. The error merely prolonged Mattingly's time up, in effect, giving him another chance for a hit that he still had to make. Had the pop-up been dropped in fair territory for an error, then Mattingly would have made it to first, but his hitting streak would not have made it to 31.

Most everything they do, is predictable. Mark Jackson passes off to either Ewing or Bill Cartwright in the low post, where they are often double-or triple-teamed. They then send the ball back out to the perimeter while seconds tick off the 24-second clock. What the team lacks is a creative player like Isiah Thomas, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan or Larry Bird.

nyt_corpus_1990.har/04/25/0346940.xml	 Boston (53-29) vs. Knicks (45-37) The home-court advantage belongs to the Celtics, which means the Knicks must win in Boston Garden, something they have not done since Feb. 29, 1984, 18 regular-season and six playoff games ago. Moreover, the Celtics had a 9-1 finish while the Knicks were 12-21 over their last 33 games. The key to a Knick upset is the club's ability to run and rebound against the big but aged front line of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish. Reggie Lewis has scored 31 and 34 points against New York in the teams' last two meetings. How well Charles Oakley rebounds off his hand injury and the helps Patrick Ewing are important factors for the Knicks. Ewing averaged 33 points in the five games against the Celtics. Boston won the season series, 4-1. Philadelphia (53-29) vs. Cleveland (42-40) The teams are similiar in that they both have big men who can score inside and outside. Both teams started slowly for different reasons. While waiting for two newcomers, Rick Mahorn and Johnny Dawkins, to jell, the 76ers posted a 16-12 start, but then enjoyed 12- and 8-game winning streaks en route to their first Atlantic Division title since 1982. The Cavaliers, the league's best 3-point shooting team, were without Brad Daugherty at center for 41 games and Larry Nance at power forward for 17 games. They won 17 of their final 23 games, including the last 6. The teams split their four regular-season games, each winning once on the road. The 76ers need to contain Mark Price, who had two 30-point games against them. Charles Barkley and Hersey Hawkins have been most troublesome for Cleveland. Detroit (59-23) vs. Indiana (42-40) An interesting aspect to the series is the coaches. Until the middle of last season, Dick Versace, the Pacer coach, was an assistant under Chuck Daly in Detroit. It figures to be an easy series for the Pistons, who try for a second straight N.B.A. title. The Pistons had the best record in the conference and beat the Pacers in four of their five regular-season meetings. Indiana will look to its running game in an effort to pull an upset. The Pacers must avoid getting into a halfcourt game with Pistons, one of the league's best defensive teams. Chicago (55-27) vs. Milwaukee (44-38) The Bucks discount the fact they have lost 15 of their last 17 games to the Bulls, including 4 of 5 this season. The thinking in Milwaukee is that the playoffs are a new day. Maybe so, especially since the Bucks have endured 26 roster changes and their players have missed 233 games through injuries, tops in the N.B.A. The Bucks are supposedly healthy. But they still must to contend with Michael Jordan, who averaged 35.

nyt_corpus_1990.har/10/28/0396163.xml	        Here is a capsule look at all 27 teams. Statistics are from last season.  EASTERN CONFERENCE: ATLANTIC DIVISION Boston Celtics Quick Recap: 52-30 record last season, lost to Knicks in first round of the playoffs. New Faces: Dee Brown (18th pick in the draft), Chris Ford (coach, a former Boston assistant), Brian Shaw (returned after season in Italy), Stojan Vrankovic (signed as free agent from Yugoslavia). Top Guns: Larry Bird (24.3 points, 93 percent free-throw average), Kevin McHale (20.9 pts., 89.3% f.t.), Reggie Lewis (17 pts.), Robert Parish (15.7 pts., 58 percent field-goal average, 10.1 rebounds). Game Plan: Ford wants the Celtics to use the fast break more, taking advantage of the speed of Shaw, Lewis and Brown. But the average age of the front line is 34, making Boston susceptible to fatigue in April and May. Playoff savvy and experience make the Celtics a contender, but only if they remain healthy.  New York Knicks Quick Recap: 45-37, lost to Detroit in second round of playoffs. New Faces: Greg Grant (free agent from Phoenix), Jerrod Mustaf (17th pick in the draft). Top Guns: Patrick Ewing (28.6 pts., 55.1% f.g., 10.9 rebs., 3.9 blocks), Charles Oakley (14.6 pts.), Gerald Wilkins (14.5 pts.), Kiki Vandeweghe (11.7 pts.). Game Plan: Coach Stu Jackson wants to play more of an up-tempo game, hoping for easier scoring opportunities. If Vandeweghe remains healthy and Mark Jackson returns to old form, New York should win 45 to 55 games. But despite Ewing's dominance, the Knicks need more from the supporting cast to get past the second round of the playoffs.  Philadelphia 76ers Quick Recap: 53-29, lost to Chicago in second round of playoffs. New Faces: Manute Bol (in trade from Golden State), Rickey Green (free agent from Indiana), Brian Oliver (32d pick). Top Guns: Charles Barkley (25.2 pts., 60% f.g., 11.5 rebs.), Hersey Hawkins (18.5 pts., 88.8% f.t., 42% f.g.), Johnny Dawkins (14.3 pts.), Mike Gminski (13.7 pts.), Ron Anderson (11.9 pts.), Rick Mahorn (10.8 pts.), Bol (3.1 pts.). Game Plan: Barkley is completely recovered from shoulder surgery. Bol should put a few more fans into the seats, and a few more shots into the basket. One of last year's biggest surprises, Philadelphia has enough offense to repeat as division champions, but its bench still lacks depth, which will hurt should any of the starters suffer an injury.  Washington Bullets Quick Recap: 31-51, failed to make the playoffs. New Faces: Pervis Ellison (in trade from the Sacramento Kings), A.: J. English (37th pick). Top Guns: Bernard King (22.4 pts.), John Williams (18.2 pts.), Ledell Eackles (13.5 pts.), Mark Alarie (10.5 pts.), Darrell Walker (8 assists), Charles Jones (2.4 blocks). Game Plan: Knee injury to Williams last season ended any hopes for the team to make playoffs. He has recovered, but trade of Jeff Malone leaves major void in the offense. The jury is still out on Ellison, whose injury-plagued rookie season earned him the nickname Out-of-Service Pervis. The Bullets should once again be out of the playoffs.  Miami Heat Quick Recap: 18-64, failed to make the playoffs. New Faces: Willie Burton (ninth pick), Bimbo Coles (40th pick), Alec Kessler (12th pick), Jeff Sanders (in trade from Chicago). Top Guns: Rony Seikaly (16.6 pts., 10.4 rebs.), Sherman Douglas (14.3 pts.), Glen Rice (13.6 pts.), Kevin Edwards (12 pts.), Jon Sundvold (44% on 3-pointers). Game Plan: The Heat's bid for instant respectability failed when Cleveland matched Miami's offer sheet to John (Hot Rod) Williams. Seikaly is becoming a force, but he needs more help. Once again, Miami will watch the playoffs from the beach, but they should crack the 20-victory barrier.  New Jersey Nets Quick Recap: 17-65, the worst record in the league. New Faces: Jud Buechler (38th pick), Derrick Coleman (first pick), Tate George (22d pick), Reggie Theus (in trade from Orlando). Top Guns: Theus (18.9 pts.), Chris Morris (14.8 pts.), Sam Bowie (14.7 pts.), Derrick Gervin (12 pts.), Mookie Blaylock (10.1 pts.), Lester Conner (2.1 steals). Game Plan: After bad chemistry, injuries, lack of talent and nonexistent fan support of last season, the Nets figure things can't get worse. Coleman will help, but he missed virtually all of training camp, which will slow his early progress. No one knows when Roy Hinson will be back from knee surgery. This will be another season when the Nets will be fortunate to win 30 games. CENTRAL DIVISION Chicago Bulls Quick Recap: 55-27 record last season, lost to Detroit in Eastern Conference final. New Faces: Dennis Hopson (in trade from Nets), Cliff Levingston (free agent from Atlanta). Top Guns: Michael Jordan (33.

New York opened the fourth quarter with a 13-0 run, turning a 70-68 deficit into an 81-70 lead. The Bulls simply couldn't score, as the Knicks' defense frustrated and suffocated Chicago.

They went through all the balls in the ball court numerous times, and only three players even hit the rim.

SHAQ ATTACK  With Michael Jordan's retirement, the 7-foot-1, 305-pound Shaquille O'Neal has become basketball's biggest marketing and style force.
nyt_corpus_1993.har/12/26/0658330.xml	        THE COLD-SHOULDER DRESS  Donna Karan designed it, Hillary Rodham Clinton wore it, and manufacturers knocked it off by the thousands. DECONSTRUCTED  The unfinished hems, ripped-apart pieces and asymmetrical cuts of Martin Margiela and other Belgian designers shocked the couture world. SNAPPLE  These trendy thirst-quenchers, including the iced-tea versions, doubled in sales in the first half of the year, an increase of more than $100 million over 1992. BLADING  In-line skating -- that is, Rollerblading -- became an even bigger recreational trend, gliding into popular culture in more and more diverse ways, from commuting to playing basketball (really) to the blading date. WAIF MODELS  The fragile gamin look ruled fashion, led by the 5-foot-7, 100-pound Kate Moss (abetted by Lucie de la Falaise and Amber Valletta). Critics saw anorexia and kiddie porn in this fantasy, but others said no, it was just fashion. THE NEXT NAOMI  Tyra Banks, a black model, became a star at the fall collections, prompting many to call her the next Naomi Campbell. But she had another idea. "I want to see more than one top black model," Ms. Banks said. "I don't want to be the next one; I want to be one of the next." THOSE BIENNIAL BUTTONS  The values of inclusion and multiculturalism were taken to arty and absurdist extremes at the Whitney Biennial. Some visitors, many of them well-dressed whites, were given a lapel button to wear that read: "I can't imagine ever wanting to be white." CU-OOL  As James Truman, the editor of Details, pointed out in his November issue, the cool way to say cool is to use this two-syllable stutter-step. Similarly, dude can be stretched into "doo-ood." BEEN THERE, DONE THAT  Heard it, heard it again, particularly out of the mouths of self-consciously blase baby boomers. Like so many catch phrases, this one is based on an old "Saturday Night Live" skit. WHOOMP!

In the songs, "it" refers to female derrieres; the entire phrases are now used to express approval. THE TENTS  In November, Seventh Avenue and its celebrity hangers-on gathered under two huge white tents in Bryant Park to show the spring collections in one central location for the first time. It seemed a big success until the finale, Donna Karan's show, when a number of influential retailers and journalists were barred from entering moments after Barbra Streisand had been escorted to her seat.

nyt_corpus_1995.har/05/14/0762591.xml	        CONGRESS  Budget-Cutters on the March  Like it or not, Congress is inching steadily closer to dismantling Government as we know it. When House and Senate budget panels approved plans last week to balance the budget in seven years, the main sticking point was tax cuts -- the House wants $350 billion in cuts, the Senate none. They'll have to hash that out if, as expected, the bills pass this week. But then would come the messy part: figuring out specific cuts, not just simple numbers. How bad will the pain be? It's a numbers game. Some estimates put it at 7 percent or more from overall spending. But since Social Security and the military are off limits, cuts in things like education and the environment could be more like 30 percent. That's pain. COMMUNICATIONS  MCI Joins Murdoch's Team  Rupert Murdoch is on a roll. He just got the F.C.C. off his back on the thorny issue of foreign ownership of American TV stations. Then last week MCI said it would invest up to $2 billion in his News Corporation. The new partners' talk was full of grand global plans, of "synergies" -- and these two companies do indeed have a history of rattling all sorts of cages. But analysts saw a coup for Mr. Murdoch, questioning those vaunted synergies. After all, even if MCI eventually owns 13.5 percent of the company, the deal gives it no true voting power. And on the news, MCI's stock fell and the News Corporation's rose. So what's in it for MCI? Clearly, a possibility of fulfilling global dreams that go beyond long distance.  REAL ESTATE  What Went Bankrupt?  It really comes down to two questions: 1) Come on, how could Rockefeller Center possibly be bankrupt? 2) Oh, does it really matter? To tackle No. 2 first, it was best summed up by a candy-store worker, right in the belly of the Midtown beast, who responded to a query about last week's Chapter 11 filing this way: "Truthfully, sir, I have no idea what you're talking about." As for No. 1, let's see: The family took out a huge mortgage. A Japanese company bought 80 percent of the center, paying too much. Rents fell when they were supposed to rise. And somehow, with all sorts of overlapping companies called Rockefeller Group, Rockefeller Center Properties, RCP Associates, things just stopped adding up. Is that clear now? WORK FORCE  Women Pay Their Way  Not long ago, if a woman had a job, it was often for little extras -- not the meat of a family budget. Well, in case you hadn't noticed, that world is long gone. If any doubts persisted, they were dispelled by a survey released last week that showed that more than half of employed women provided at least half of their household income. The study "challenges the persistent notion that women's earnings are supplemental," said Arlene Johnson of the Families and Work Institute, co-sponsor of the survey. Not that all women want to be breadwinners -- 31 percent said that if money were abundant, they'd be tending to their families, while just 21 percent of men stated that preference. And some women, of course, have no choice -- the men aren't around. MARKETS  Emerging Is as Emerging Does  It was a noble idea, fairly oozing with pioneer spirit. Three years ago the American Stock Exchange decided to give a break to some little companies that didn't quite fit the mold but that, it hoped, had boundless futures. Last week the Amex ended the experiment, called the Emerging Company Marketplace, saying no new companies would be added. Not only did some of the companies fail to emerge, but nearly a quarter of them are now worthless. The tales behind the companies range from the blatant (one's largest shareholder was a convicted arsonist) to the bizarre (another's chairman had been sued by the S.E.C., but had since had a sex-change operation). But the lesson seemed to be that there is, after all, a reason for an exchange to have rigorous rules for membership. Or simply this: Emerge first, then apply.  ANNUAL REPORTS  The Pepsi Investor Next Door  Pity the designers of annual reports. They're duty-bound to put heavy machinery or cereal boxes on the covers -- but don't want to make them so dull-looking that stockholders will quickly toss them. Why, they must wonder occasionally, can't they put some glamorous model on the cover? No, what a silly idea, they surely say, as they switch off their daydreams and try to think good thoughts about tractors. But apparently someone at Pepsi had that very daydream -- and forgot to wake up. And so it is that Pepsi's just-released annual report could easily be mistaken for Glamour or Vogue -- there's Cindy Crawford gazing seductively out at you -- without a soda can in sight. The cover line: "A typical investor looks us over." Sure, Pepsi, sure.  RIVALRIES  From Cold War to Cola War  Who says there are no superpower rivalries left? Even with the cold war over, Coke and Pepsi are still engaged in their mythic battle for the gullets of the masses. And even if Pepsi scored one for having the sexiest annual report, Coke caught the Presidential eye in Russia last week. Mr. Clinton, picking an American investment to publicize by bestowing a visit, chose a Coke plant near Moscow. There was a reasonable political explanation: Coke owns its Russian plant, while Pepsi's is a joint venture. But could it be because Coke has contributed more to Democrats lately? Or maybe Mr. Clinton, weary of vodka, craved a soda -- and figured the Coke plant was the nearest place to get a free one. It was, after all, right on the way to the airport. TRANSPORTATION  You Could Always Walk  In a single century, a historical speck, we've gotten used to the odd notion that if we want to be 30 miles away in half an hour, we should be able to do it -- no matter what damage is done to the environment. Now, as the world struggles to retain that luxury, someone had the bright idea of mandating a certain number of electric cars by 1998 -- a down payment on a pristine new world of travel. But is it possible? Practical hurdles still loom, of course -- but there's more: now comes a study saying that emissions from mining and smelting the lead needed for batteries might cause their own nasty threats to public health. But what of the argument that at least pollution would be shifted away from cities? Not so, said one toxicologist; "lead particles can move long distances." SOUVENIRS  23! 45! 23!

Every time the Knicks take the court at Madison Square Garden, he is front and center at his courtside seat cheering on his beloved home team. He has a genuine Knicks jersey, John Starks's No. 3. He has flown from the Cannes Film Festival on the Concorde to catch a playoff game and has dashed cross-country and back not to miss a big game between the Knicks and the Chicago Bulls. In ''Best Seat in the House,'' which presents Mr. Lee's unfocused musings on basketball, he recounts the impact sports has had on his life and career. The book, which was written with Ralph Wiley, a former reporter at Sports Illustrated, has its high moments. Of the decision to skip his father's jazz concert to go to a crucial seventh game in the playoffs, he writes: ''In retrospect I know it hurt my father that I didn't go to the concert. He never let on, though. In fact, he made me give him a blow-by-blow account of the game.'' One longs for more such personal asides. Unfortunately, too much of the book sounds like play-by-play television commentary, replete with colorful trivia often of little relevance to the action. Mr. Lee's interviews with Walt Frazier (his favorite player), Michael Jordan, Bill Bradley and Woody Allen, another celebrated Knicks fan, are entertaining but not particularly insightful.

In doing so, he hopes that the Bouley name will soon signify a top-quality food product available everywhere.

nyt_corpus_1997.har/11/02/0969650.xml	        Rotella's greatest contribution to the already overcrowded field of golf advice, however, may be the case he makes for golf as a reaction sport. True, the ball is stationary when you go to hit it. That, in fact, is part of the problem: the golfer has all the time in the world to think. Most coaches teach that any conscious attention to mechanics should be limited during the golfer's swing to a single thought. That's one too many for Rotella, who contends that ''the best swing thought is no thought.'' In basketball, when Michael Jordan is at the free-throw line, Rotella says, he's not reminding himself to keep his knees slightly flexed or to check the position of his hands -- he looks at his target and shoots.

Like the runaway cost of Michelle Musler's tickets, there appears to be no stopping this locomotive industry, as it has merged with the entertainment game to create a television-fueled explosion of expansion and wealth. Who could have imagined a decade ago that a single player, even one as breathtaking as Michael Jordan, could reel in a reported $80 million in salary and endorsements in a single year? That a media and entertainment baron would bid $1 billion to own a single team, as Rupert Murdoch offered recently for England's world-famous Manchester United soccer club? A year ago, Murdoch paid $311 million for the Los Angeles Dodgers, after Financial World magazine estimated the value of the team and its assets at about $180 million.

Sillerman, a radio mogul, the publicly traded SFX has swallowed up a bevy of pop-music concert presenters and venues, now controlling  more than half the national market, including 31 of the country's 37 amphitheaters. Late last year, it bought Pace, the leading producer of theatrical touring shows in America, then went shopping for other theatrical properties across the map. Since theater on the road is now a far larger business than Broadway, SFX is de facto the most powerful theater producer in the country. We have come a long way from impresarios like David Merrick and Joseph Papp, who produced both high art and schlock but who ventured from theater only to dabble in movies or television.

nyt_corpus_1998.har/12/20/1070978.xml	        This verdict strikes me about as wrong as it could be. By airily removing herself to the cosmic narratives of Huck and Jim, Carby leaps over more recent and relevant buddy pairs who affirm loyal partnership while also making way for women, blacks, Jews and Latinos -- Starsky and Hutch, Crockett and Tubbs, Cagney and Lacey, Bobby and Sipowicz, Chris and Rita in the original ''Silk Stalkings.'' ''Lethal Weapon 2'' reverses the old racial iconography in other ways. The white Riggs (Gibson) is the dangerous primitive, the defiant Dionysian, while the black Murtaugh (Glover) is enveloped in caution and domesticity. When his daughter appears in a condom ad, he's the consummate Dad, foolish and befuddled -- which is to say the black man gets a crack at normality. As their racial banter indicates, such universalism doesn't come at the price of blackness, any more than Oprah Winfrey's or Michael Jordan's white fans stop seeing them as black.

For 15 years, Caray and Stone were the broadcasters for the Chicago Cubs. They were not exactly give-and-take sportscasters: ''Harry did most of the talking.'' Caray acknowledged his garrulousness early in the 1997 season: ''I'm getting older every day. I don't know how many words I have left in me, so I better use them all now.'' Stone says he just watched as Caray extricated himself from silly on-air problems, like talking into a lamp instead of the microphone or turning off the sound by leaning on the cough button for a couple of minutes. Mispronunciations came naturally to Caray, and he knew it. In a game against the Colorado Rockies, Frank Castillo pitched against Vinny Castilla and Pedro Castellano. ''Are you kidding me? They did this to me on purpose,'' Caray yelled. Stone recalls Michael Jordan's refusal to sit in the broadcast booth: ''I love Harry, but I don't want to go on the air and have him introduce me as Michael Jackson.

His father soon abandoned the family, leaving Love to be reared by his mother and a cruel stepfather who evidently resented bringing up another man's child. Love's stutter made him the butt of cruel jokes, forcing him deeper and deeper into a shell. Only through sports, first football, then basketball, was he able to find his place in the world. A star at Southern University, Love was drafted by the Cincinnati Royals, where he played alongside the great Oscar Robertson. Later, he was chosen in the expansion draft by the Milwaukee Bucks, then traded to the Chicago Bulls, where he became one of only three players to have his number retired, the other two being Jerry Sloan and Michael Jordan.

He had absolutely nothing against King Hussein.'') Although he is as isolated and lonely as ever, repairing to a nightly intake of alcohol in order to ''deaden the sense of desolation,'' Schmidt's companionship is sought after by his high-flying neighbor in East Hampton, the ''colossally rich'' Michael Mansour. Mansour, an ''eerily brutal and bright'' Jewish financier with dubious connections, invites him to frequent lunches and dinners, where finger bowls are de rigueur and a bodyguard named Jason provides on-the-spot shoulder massages.

Ennio Stacchetti, an old colleague of Sargent's, received a phone call from Sargent ''strongly hinting that he was on his way to N.Y.U.'' Stacchetti promptly accepted his own offer from N.Y.U. John Leahy at Boston University did likewise. For Gianluca Violante, a young macroeconomist, what transpired among the recruits was ''a critical-mass effect.

In Hank Aaron and the Home Run That Changed America (Morrow, $23.95), Tom Stanton, like Reisler, gives a fresh take on a familiar topic. Though the fact has been largely obscured by time, the majority of sportswriters in the late 1960's thought the more popular and outgoing Willie Mays -- ''cherry-red satin'' to Aaron's ''gray flannel,'' Stanton writes -- would be the man to pass Ruth. The closer Aaron got to the record, the more hate mail and death threats he received; after he hit his 715th home run early in the 1974 season, a deluge of emotion followed, which included more than 20,000 congratulatory telegrams. Even Pravda acknowledged him. Stanton, the author of two memoirs, ''The Road to Cooperstown'' and ''The Final Season,'' is fuzzy on the significance of Aaron's achievement; Hank Aaron may have ''cleared a path for the Michael Jordans and Tiger Woodses of the sporting world,'' but did Jordan and Woods really follow that path?

On the one hand, these stories always seemed a little hard to square with Mickelson's image as a clean-cut, down-to-earth family man, so devoted to his wife that as she neared the end of her pregnancy with their first child he took a beeper with him to the 1999 U.S. Open, fully prepared to walk off the course if she went into labor. Whatever else he is, Mickelson is clearly not a self-destructive head case like John Daly, who really has lost millions. Nor does he display any of the bored, regal aloofness of Michael Jordan, another famous gambler.
