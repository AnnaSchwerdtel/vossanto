* "The Rodney Dangerfield of Stylistic Devices": End-to-End Detection and Extraction of Vossian Antonomasia Using Neural Networks.

** Description
This is an extension of the dataset from [[https://aclanthology.org/D19-1647.pdf][Schwab et al. (2019)]] which
 was the result of a semi-automated VA extraction method on The New
 York Times Annotated Corpus (Sandhaus, 2008) which contains around
 1.8 million articles that were published between 1987 and 2007. The
 dataset creation is based on a syntax-based approach focusing on nine
 syntactic pattern around the source (“the/a/an SOURCE of/for/among”).
 In a second step, the approach used Wikidata for entity
 linking. Here, the authors focused on entities with the property
 “instance of” “human”. At the end, a blacklist was manually generated
 to remove false positive142 candidates. Thus, all instances contain
 one of nine syntactical patterns around the source and all VA sources
 are linked to human entities in Wikidata. 96.3% of the instances in
 the dataset contain the boundary word “of” after the source. In 68.0%
 of those instances, there exists a VA expression. The boundary word
 “for” was found in 3.2% of all instances of which 6.0% contained a VA
 expression and “among” was found only in 0.5% of the instances where
 41.0% contained a VA expression. This shows that the pattern
 distribution is highly unequal and the boundary word “of” dominates.
 We used the dataset and annotated all chunks of the VA expressions
 within all sentences. We also found and updated incorrectly labeled
 instances in the dataset. That included positive labeled instances
 that did not contain any VA expression, only syntactical patterns
 that looked like VA expressions. It also included falsely tagged VA
 expressions that appeared not to be a VA expression. Those instances
 were re-labeled and re-annotated.  At last, we removed duplicates
 that showed up because instances appeared in multiple articles of the
 New York Times and therefore were intentionally not removed before.

In total, the new dataset consists of 5,995 sentences. 3,066 of them
include a VA, 2,929 do not.

Annotations: The target is encapsulated by "|", the source by "*" and
the modifier by "/".

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q303][Elvis Presley]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E7DD1E39F937A35753C1A96E958260][(1998/10/04/)]] And that was fine with the Met's trustees, who looked upon |photography|, more or less, as the *Elvis* of /the visual arts/: fast, slick and indecently young, with a history going back only as far as 1839.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q368744][Charles Atlas]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0D8103CF935A35752C1A966958260][(1990/11/06/)]] And that was when |Charles Oakley|, the *Charles Atlas* of /forwards/, was about to attempt a jump shot.

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22686][Donald Trump]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6DA1F3AF93BA25751C0A96F958260][(1999/02/18/)]] And the strong sense of history prompts obvious parallels: Karen Cord Taylor, editor and publisher of The Beacon Hill Times, pointed out that |Charles Bulfinch|, the famed architect and developer whose gems, like the State House, crown Beacon Hill, was something like the *Donald J. Trump* of /his day/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5593][Pablo Picasso]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402EED6163FF932A2575BC0A9669C8B63][(2000/08/11/)]] And the works of Gonzalez and Picasso, in turn, inspired |David Smith|, an American who might be called the *Picasso* of /welding/, so inventive and prolific was his output from the 1930's into the 1960's.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q298255][Rob Zombie]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E3D61531F937A1575BC0A9679C8B63][(2001/08/24/)]] And their leader, |Big Daddy Mars| (Richard Cetrone), with his leather body armor and lank, dirty hair, seems to be the *Rob Zombie* of /2176/, when ''Ghosts'' is set.

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q153032][Mona Lisa]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE2DE1730F933A25756C0A965958260][(1993/05/10/)]] But Bonilla thought it was going to be a home run, and stood at second admiring it, like |it| was the *Mona Lisa* of /long balls/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q230762][Dale Carnegie]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE4DB1631F933A15755C0A965958260][(1993/06/20/)]] But Christopher Beach, director of the Performing Arts Center, described |Dr. Lenz| as "no more than a *Dale Carnegie* of /the 90's/."
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q92566][Flash Gordon]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E5D91E30F935A25755C0A9629C8B63][(2004/06/16/)]] But |City Councilman Michael McMahon| has become the *Flash Gordon* of /Staten Island/, determined to vanquish the planet of pleasure.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q453251][Horatio Alger]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E1DF163BF931A35750C0A9679C8B63][(2001/03/02/)]] But |Claesen| was definitely a *Horatio Alger* of /the Colonial era/, having made it from indentured servant to wealthy town magistrate.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1511][Richard Wagner]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7D71639F932A35751C0A967958260][(1991/02/01/)]] But |David Greenspan| apparently aspires to be the *Richard Wagner* of /the genre/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q44301][Jim Morrison]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02E4D61639F932A05752C0A960958260][(1996/01/31/)]] But "Excess and Punishment," which opens today at the Film Forum, makes no attempt to lionize |Schiele| as the *Jim Morrison* of /Austrian Expressionists/.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q447215][Lincoln]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE3DD173AF930A35752C0A965958260][(1993/01/03/)]] But Ford revamped the Lincoln for 1990, and the real news in automotive cabin-cruisers this year comes from Cadillac, which has stretched and redesigned its 1993 Fleetwood four-door, making it the longest -- and generally the biggest -- production car sold anywhere in the world.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1929421][Nicholson Baker]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E3DB1731F932A35756C0A9639C8B63][(2005/05/01/)]] But ''Freakonomics'' is so sly, finicky and micro-observant that the Indiana Jones comparison feels a little off -- |Levitt| is more like the *Nicholson Baker* of /economists/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q193156][Ralph Nader]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE0D6163CF930A15756C0A963958260][(1995/05/23/)]] But |Fumio Matsuda|, who is head of the Japan Automobile Consumers Union and is often described as the *Ralph Nader* of /Japan/, said officials there simply did not care as much about safety as did officials in the United States.

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q216288][Garth Brooks]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E0DA163AF93AA15752C0A96E958260][(1998/01/29/)]] But |Grisham| is the *Garth Brooks* of /popular literature/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5582][Vincent van Gogh]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E3D71E3AF937A35754C0A96F958260][(1999/07/04/)]] But I guarantee you, |he| will become the *Van Gogh* of /the 60's/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q855][Joseph Stalin]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DC163BF932A35753C1A966958260][(1990/10/01/)]] But I have seen even greater perversities, if only on the movies or on TV; I saw Hitler waving in a friendly manner to fanaticized little girls of the Hitlerjugend; I saw mass murderer Stalin kissing a child with the red Communist youth organization scarf, a child whose parents ended up like so many in Gulag camps; I saw |Gottwald|, the *Stalin* of /Czechoslovakia/, smilingly joking with young miners, the builders of socialism and soon to be cripples; I saw the Iraqi president Hussein patting the children of his hostages whom - as he now says - he is ready to have shot.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8021572][Willie Horton]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE6D7103EF932A35752C0A967958260][(1991/01/01/)]] But I think it's clearly a warning to us as Democrats that we cannot let them make quotas the *Willie Horton* of /1992/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36107][Muhammad Ali]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E0DB133BF93AA35754C0A9629C8B63][(2004/07/09/)]] But I think she's getting stronger as the Olympics get closer, because it's sort of like |she|'s the *Muhammad Ali* of /her era/.

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5195372][Curt Flood]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E6D81F38F931A15752C0A96E958260][(1998/01/22/)]] But Jack Newfield, who has written several New York Post columns lamenting the industry's neglect of Mr. Price, called |him| the *Curt Flood* of /rock-and-roll/, the rebel who showed a generation of musicians how to stand up for themselves.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2158789][Robert S. Strauss]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E7D8153FF93AA15753C1A9609C8B63][(2006/10/29/)]] But James M. Lindsay, a director of the Robert S. Strauss for International Security and Law at the University of Texas in Austin and a former national security official in the Clinton administration, said big wins in 2006 may well embolden antiwar Democrats in 2008, while pulling ''centrists'' like Mrs. Clinton closer to withdrawal.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766][P. T. Barnum]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504EFDB1539F930A15755C0A960958260][(1996/06/23/)]] But |Kevin J. Kinsella|, known as the *P. T. Barnum* of /biotech/,  has come very close to living the myth.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4859415][Barbara Woodhouse]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DC173FF937A15753C1A967958260][(1991/10/24/)]] But Lady |Caroline Wrey|, otherwise known as Lady Velcro, the *Barbara Woodhouse* of /windows/, has a foolproof barometer.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q186][Ken Jennings]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E1D6113EF933A25751C1A9609C8B63][(2006/12/10/)]] But Lawson, presumably viewing |Oldham| as the *Ken Jennings* of /criminalia/, falls prey to the common trap of letting only the caged canary sing.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q171556][Yves Saint Laurent]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2D81639F932A35751C1A9649C8B63][(2002/12/01/)]] But |Miguel| was being heralded as the *Yves Saint Laurent* of /American fashion/.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254][Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7D81E3DF93AA1575AC0A960958260][(1996/09/29/)]] But Mozart the metaphysical modernist was not the Mozart of late 19th-century musical taste, especially Viennese musical taste, which had transformed him into the wigged and powdered puppet of a bygone age of security and grace.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7302][George Frideric Handel]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07EED7163FF936A35750C0A96F958260][(1999/03/05/)]] But Mr. Adams, not quite out of his post-Minimalist phase, is not the Handel of ''Aureole.''+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q589905][Red Adair]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E7DC1139F93BA35752C1A9669C8B63][(2000/11/08/)]] But Mr. Feld figures their businesses have enough in common that |he| can market himself as the *Red Adair* of /information technology/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q83807][Ed Sullivan]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DD1F3CF930A25751C1A961948260][(1987/12/13/)]] But Mr. Schmidt, too, wonders about Mr. Adams's future role: ''I see |him| more as the facilitator, the introducer, kind of the *Ed Sullivan* of /the program/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8023][Nelson Mandela]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E2DE1630F93BA1575AC0A9609C8B63][(2006/09/28/)]] But |Mr. Shih|, a man sometimes described as the *Nelson Mandela* of /Taiwan/, is now leading a movement that, as he acknowledged in an interview, is heavily composed of Nationalists, his longtime enemies who once ran the country under martial law.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q79904][J. D. Salinger]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE4DD1F38F930A35751C1A9649C8B63][(2002/12/03/)]] But |Mr. Trudeau|, who has not given a sit-down television interview in 31 years, is the *J. D. Salinger* of /comic strip artists/.

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q117012][Yoko Ono]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E7DA143AF930A1575AC0A962958260][(1994/09/23/)]] But |Ms. Love| won't be the *Yoko Ono* of /alternative rock/, mourning with the fans.

+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7312][Franz Schubert]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E7D71238F934A25756C0A961958260][(1997/05/17/)]] But Muscle Beach is an odd place to encounter the Schubert of the late C minor Sonata and the Chopin of the four ballades.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37349][Dalai Lama]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3DC103CF931A25750C0A967958260][(1991/03/12/)]] But President Bush, who so warmly applauded President Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippines, has deferred to China by accusing the Dalai Lama of a "callous attitude" toward the people he has served.+

Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, said the situation was inexcusable, and accused the President Bush of cheating tourists.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q235262][Emmy]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E6DD153EF934A35752C1A96E958260][(1998/11/07/)]] But ''The X-Files'' has grown into something much bigger than a cult hit: it is routinely nominated for the Emmy for best drama.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6691][Homer]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE0DF153BF932A1575BC0A96F948260][(1989/08/21/)]] But |Tony Schwartz| is also the *Homer* of /the Information Age/, a collector and communicator of the aural tradition and a celebrant of the received word in an era that deifies the video image.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q24845001][Oleg Kovalyshyn]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0DF1738F934A25753C1A966958260][(1990/10/17/)]] But Vann McElroy, a two-time Pro Bowl performer who was a Raider for nine years, did not.+

+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q28835627][Taxis]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E4D7133EF935A1575BC0A9629C8B63][(2004/08/26/)]] But a group of protesters from an advocacy group for the disabled, the Taxis for All Campaign, held up signs and testified that even 27 new medallions would be far too few.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386][Rodney Dangerfield]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E4D8103CF930A35751C1A960958260][(1996/12/03/)]] But a new study from Hotwired, the Internet media service of Wired Ventures Inc., concludes that |banner advertising| perhaps ought not to be considered the *Rodney Dangerfield* of /interactive advertising/.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9960][Ronald Reagan]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DF153EF933A15750C0A961948260][(1987/03/20/)]] But after about a half-dozen questions, he seemed to hit his stride, answering at some length and with considerably more composure, even though he never oozed self-confidence like the Ronald Reagan of old.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q44616][Wyatt Earp]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE2DC123AF936A2575AC0A964958260][(1992/09/15/)]] But after that last class bell rings, |the 41-year-old father of two| turns into the *Wyatt Earp* of /the wasp world/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386][Rodney Dangerfield]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE1DD1330F936A1575BC0A960958260][(1996/08/25/)]] But alas, the *Rodney Dangerfield* of /Saddle River/ got no enduring respect from the Clintons.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421][Michael Jordan]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE5D91F31F934A25752C0A96F958260][(1999/01/17/)]] But although Jordan retired from the Chicago Bulls and the game of basketball last week, there's still a *Michael Jordan* of /snowboarding/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9644491][Balduíno Rambo]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E1D8113CF932A35755C0A9679C8B63][(2001/06/01/)]] But an American way of the warrior provides the deeper story in this  novel that combines a bit of ''Thus Spake Zarathustra'' with elements of ''Rambo,'' a *Rambo* for /people who prefer the stiletto to the assault rifle/.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q235262][Emmy]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E4DB1539F936A35752C1A9679C8B63][(2001/11/05/)]] But as Schilling was setting Clemens up for a strikeout, did anyone care that Peter MacNicol had won an Emmy for best supporting actor in a comedy?+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234068][Madeline Kahn]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E7DC173BF931A25756C0A9669C8B63][(2000/05/12/)]] But as portrayed by |Ms. Hoffmann|, who may be the *Madeline Kahn* of /the Clearasil set/, she's also the source of some of the film's best scenes, and the mouthpiece for its funniest lines.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q587455][Barry Diller]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E7D81F3DF932A35756C0A9659C8B63][(2003/05/01/)]] But at other times, the conversation was reminiscent of dinner parties with the high and mighty during which the hostess asks the powerful man to her left a fawning question -- ''Who is the *Barry Diller* of /the Democratic Party/?''
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q367566][Yogi Berra]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804E3DE113EF932A15753C1A9679C8B63][(2001/10/21/)]] But because we cannot merely appreciate his supernatural skill, there has been a movement to make |Ichiro| the *Yogi Berra* of /these times/.

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4912331][Billy Carter]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E0DE1130F932A3575AC0A9679C8B63][(2001/09/01/)]] But by 1991, Ed Thompson had tired of all the bad decisions he had made, and of hearing the governor joke that |Ed| was the *Billy Carter* of /Wisconsin/.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5593][Pablo Picasso]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E4DD113EF933A2575AC0A96E958260][(1998/09/10/)]] But by then, by many accounts, the Picasso of her shrine seemed more real than the living artist.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q285536][Imelda Marcos]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E0DF1238F934A25752C0A9639C8B63][(2005/01/17/)]] But comments occasionally seem deliberately naïve, like a reference by Michael Farquhar, author of ''A Treasury of Royal Scandals,'' to |Marie|, with her fashion excesses, as ''the *Imelda Marcos* of /her day/.''
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q181413][Julie Christie]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E3DE1E3FF93BA25757C0A9619C8B63][(2007/04/18/)]] But either way, she seems at peace with herself, away from the shadow of the Julie Christie of yore.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40531][John Wayne]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401EFDE103FF930A15753C1A9639C8B63][(2005/10/23/)]] But even as |Clemens|, the *John Wayne* of /pitchers/, gave a tough-guy answer about ignoring the aches that he had accumulated in 22 seasons, he probably never imagined he would be in the clubhouse getting his hamstring treated after collecting six outs.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131237][Carl Lewis]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DF173EF936A25751C0A964958260][(1992/02/15/)]] But even if she did not, |she| has at least established herself as the *Carl Lewis* of /her sport/, its dominant sprinter.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q34851][Elizabeth Taylor]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4D9133EF932A15754C0A967958260][(1991/07/21/)]] But even if |she| turns out to be the *Liz Taylor* of /her day/, going through men like diamond necklaces, her audience is already lined up at theaters and newsstands and video stores.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3244512][Harry Potter]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06EFD71F3FF93BA15752C1A9629C8B63][(2004/11/28/)]] But even if the second phase of Yozi proceeded to a third, and the drink became a raging success, the *Harry Potter* of /the yogurt drink market/, |Cristman| would never pack a Yozi, or any of his other designs, in his own daughter's lunch bag.

+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q27230366][B]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04EFDF133BF937A1575AC0A9669C8B63][(2000/09/24/)]] But even she found some exhibits interesting and said that she would also give the museum a B for children younger than she.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q462481][Mark McGwire]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E1D8103CF931A25754C0A96F958260][(1999/07/12/)]] But even though Pedro Martinez is slight enough to be a tattoo on the biceps of Mark McGwire, |he| is the *Mark McGwire* of /pitchers in 1999/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q93957][Gary Cooper]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE1D9103CF93BA3575BC0A9669C8B63][(2000/08/08/)]] But |every male politician|'s fantasy is being called the *Gary Cooper* of /the Senate/.)

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103767][Charlie Parker]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E4DF123EF93AA3575BC0A960958260][(1996/08/09/)]] But for all its admiration, ''Basquiat'' winds up no closer to that assessment than to the critic Robert Hughes's more jaundiced one: ''Far from being the *Charlie Parker* of /SoHo/ (as his promoters claimed), |he| became its Jessica Savitch.''
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q319079][Bob Dole]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E2D61131F935A2575BC0A960958260][(1996/08/16/)]] But for all of his resolve, the Bob Dole of this speech is also fair, imbued with a sense of justice, social responsibility and compassion by his life experience and his father's love for ''a son who was thought to be dying in an Army hospital.''+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q152505][Leonard Bernstein]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E4DE1438F930A35753C1A9629C8B63][(2004/10/03/)]] But for this hardened older listener, at least, the Bernstein of this vintage comes off as the ideal dinner guest: brilliant, almost frighteningly articulate, warm, funny and wise.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16062429][Thomas Welbank Fowle]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE5DE1131F933A25752C0A967958260][(1991/01/10/)]] But give him an F for writing a garish comic book without pictures.+

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q298237][Benedict Arnold]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEED61130F937A15757C0A963958260][(1995/04/24/)]] But he has received a barrage of angry electronic-mail messages from cyberspace regulars, accusing |him|, Mr. Stoll says, of being "the *Benedict Arnold* of /the computer world/."
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q234952][Betsy Ross]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E7D7173BF934A35751C0A96F958260][(1999/02/07/)]] But |he| is not remembered as the *Betsy Ross* of /Arabia/.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7356939][Rodney Hampton]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E5DB1F3BF937A25752C1A960958260][(1996/11/14/)]] But he is not the Rodney Hampton of previous seasons that everyone came to know and respect.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2130627][Randall Terry]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E6DC153AF933A15754C0A9679C8B63][(2001/07/20/)]] But he said that he did regret some of what he has said and done (although he would not say what), and he wondered aloud what yesterday's Randall Terry would say about the Randall Terry of today.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41749][Joseph Goebbels]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D7103EF93AA3575AC0A961948260][(1987/09/09/)]] But he showed little regard for the army, whose spokesman he likened several times to Hitler's propaganda chief, calling |him| ''the *Goebbels* of /Aguinaldo/.''
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q937][Albert Einstein]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE5DA1231F933A2575AC0A96F948260][(1989/09/10/)]] But |he| was a genius, the *Einstein* of /the law/.''
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5592][Michelangelo]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02E4DA113FF930A2575BC0A9679C8B63][(2001/08/13/)]] But |he| will have found the best of whatever it is, the *Michelangelo* of /seashell art/.''
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8005887][William Brennan]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E4D7163FF932A15754C0A9639C8B63][(2005/07/21/)]] But here is where conservatives and liberals may part company about John Roberts: Conservatives hope |he| will be a *William Brennan* of /the right/, using his intelligence and charm on behalf of his deeply conservative views to move the court far to the right of where it was under the moderate influence of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor; liberals fear that conservatives are correct.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q201608][Dennis Rodman]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E1DD1539F933A25751C0A960958260][(1996/02/10/)]] But here |she| is anyway, the *Dennis Rodman* of /the running set/ with her spiked  haircut, an earring in her eyebrow, a tattoo of a rat on one leg and Edvard Munch's "The Scream" on the other.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q235262][Emmy]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDD1F31F934A35754C0A9649C8B63][(2002/07/07/)]] But his career revived in 1994, when he won an Emmy for HBO's searing prison drama ''Against the Wall,'' about the bloody 1971 riot at the Attica Correctional Facility in upstate New York.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1443680][Frank Lorenzo]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4DE1F3CF931A15750C0A966958260][(1990/03/22/)]] But his insistence on replacing strikers with nonunion drivers, and retaining them after the strike, has made |him| the *Frank Lorenzo* of /the highways/ in the eyes of Greyhound drivers, and raised the prospect of a long and bitter strike, Professor Shaiken said.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8619][Pierre Trudeau]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1DB1338F932A25754C0A9669C8B63][(2000/07/11/)]] But his sudden sweep to national prominence, culminating with his decisive election Saturday night as leader of the new Canadian Alliance Party, seems vaguely familiar, leading some commentators to call |him| the *Pierre Trudeau* of /the right/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q712180][Wilford Brimley]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E5DE143FF936A15753C1A9609C8B63][(2006/10/25/)]] But how do you bump off the *Wilford Brimley* of /coaches/?
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9696][John F.

+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37349][Dalai Lama]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E5DD113DF935A15752C1A960958260][(1996/11/26/)]] But human rights groups say China has sought to destroy Tibetan culture, and the Chinese have been largely unable to melt the adulation for the Dalai Lama among many ordinary Tibetans, who revere him as a god and a king.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q271939][Chuck Yeager]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6D91338F934A35756C0A964958260][(1992/05/07/)]] But if |Jordan| is the *Chuck Yeager* of /basketball/, Julius Erving was its Charles Lindbergh and Connie Hawkins was its Wright Brothers.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675][Johnny Appleseed]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E3D71F3DF93BA35751C1A961958260][(1997/12/08/)]] But if Mr. Dunifer's advocates see |him| as a free-speech crusader and the *Johnny Appleseed* of /low-power radio/, the F.C.C., the legal guardian of the common property of the airwaves, sees him as a radio ''pirate'' who is breaking the law, disrupting licensed broadcasters and posing a threat to public safety.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q193156][Ralph Nader]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DEFDB113EF93AA2575BC0A9679C8B63][(2001/08/19/)]] But if Mr. Hevesi (or for that matter, Mr. Green) stayed on the ballot and allowed Mr. Bloomberg to win the election, as Ms. Hope suggested was possible, |he| could become known as the *Ralph Nader* of /New York/, something that could effectively end his career in his own party.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21510184][Bernard Dell]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE7DE133AF931A25751C0A9629C8B63][(2004/02/12/)]] But if an iPod isn't for you, you could do worse than buying the Dell for its simplicity and economy, the iRiver for its super-geeky feature list or the Rio Karma for its excellent design and compact dimensions.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q254][Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E3DA1530F937A15750C0A9619C8B63][(2007/03/24/)]] But if there was honor in being the *Mozart* of ''/The Mole People/'' (1956), there was little glory.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675][Johnny Appleseed]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DA1E3AF936A35750C0A963958260][(1995/03/05/)]] But in 1974, |Brent Musburger| started broadcasting the college tournament for CBS and became the *Johnny Appleseed* of /alliteration/, using the phrase he had known as a high school reporter for the old Chicago American.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q38757][Bertolt Brecht]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5DC1330F933A05754C0A96E948260][(1988/07/30/)]] But in ''Die Walkure,'' the emphasis shifts to the Brecht of ''Mother Courage'' - stark studies of tough, painfully real people on a largely bare stage.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q236540][Rose Kennedy]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02EFDB163DF937A35754C0A96F958260][(1999/07/04/)]] But in Glen Cove, a city where the name Suozzi has a Kennedyesque aura, |Mrs. Suozzi| is the quiet matriarch, the *Rose Kennedy* of /a political dynasty with a small-town cachet/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21847069][Annie Osborn]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E2DA143DF93AA35751C1A961958260][(1997/12/09/)]] But in a social season that crams 300 benefits into three months, turning |City Opera's gala|, a lavish dinner following a new production of ''Macbeth,'' into a *Cinderella* of /fund-raisers/ took more than the wave of a wand.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1225][Bruce Springsteen]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E3DF103FF936A15752C0A9609C8B63][(2006/01/25/)]] But in front of this crowd, he wisely hammered out the standards that made |him| the *Bruce Springsteen* of /Long Island/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7377586][Rudy Boesch]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E1D8103EF93BA15756C0A9609C8B63][(2006/05/28/)]] But in interviews, a rough outline emerges that casts |Mr. Colen| as the Richard Hatch -- albeit clothed -- or at least the *Rudy Boesch* of /the show's contemporary-art island/, and that tends to make Ms. Stupak, because of her already-established art connections, something of a diva.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421][Michael Jordan]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3DD1039F937A15751C1A966958260][(1990/12/24/)]] But, in reality, I think |I| could be the *Michael Jordan* of /12th men/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21847069][Annie Osborn]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DB1E3BF937A25756C0A963958260][(1995/05/14/)]] But in the last five years |it| has become something of a *Cinderella* of /the siding industry/, swept from its humble beginnings by consumer demand for maintenance-free living.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386][Rodney Dangerfield]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E3D71E31F937A1575AC0A9609C8B63][(2006/09/24/)]] But in their locker room, they still view |their team| as the *Rodney Dangerfield* of /the N.F.L./, a squad craving respect.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40475][Joan Crawford]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500EFDF1031F933A25756C0A96E958260][(1998/05/10/)]] But in these last two decades, the Joan Crawford of ''Mommie Dearest'' the movie has lived another, quite different life.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766][P. T. Barnum]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E2DE163AF935A2575BC0A96E958260][(1998/08/16/)]] But instead of the puttering Duchess, it is owned by |the Tussauds Group|, the *P. T. Barnum* of /British history/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q913][Socrates]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE0DF153FF931A15752C0A9609C8B63][(2006/01/22/)]] But it also certifies |Mr. Snyder|'s reputation as the *Socrates* of /the late-night airwaves/, capable of disarming some carefully constructed personas with a few innocent questions.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q562705][Capone]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DC1131F93BA15755C0A961948260][(1987/06/28/)]] But it doesn't sufficiently allow for the Napoleonic element in Capone (the Capone of cinematic myth, that is, not the real man), and it doesn't permit him to dominate the action as ferociously as he does in most movie versions of the legend.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q442202][Vanna White]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E2DE1030F932A15752C0A96F958260][(1999/01/21/)]] But it is |Ms. Vega|, 43, who has become the *Vanna White* of /the lottery drawings/, invited to more charity events and panel discussions and onto the Oprah Winfrey show for a makeover.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16062429][Thomas Welbank Fowle]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E0D61731F931A25752C0A9659C8B63][(2003/01/12/)]] But it received an F for both its laws to protect people from secondhand smoke and its measures to stop children from smoking.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3822242][Mary Agnes Chase]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE6D6143EF937A25756C0A9609C8B63][(2006/05/14/)]] But it was a strong performance for a team that is still finding its way after struggling a year ago and finishing out of the Chase for the Nextel Cup.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q10520][David Beckham]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CEFDB123FF935A15754C0A9639C8B63][(2005/07/26/)]] But it wasn't until |Mr. Cooper|, the man the English press has called the Brad Pitt and the *David Beckham* of /dance/, began to strip to his 18th-century knickers as the irresistibly frozen-hearted, woman-devouring Vicomte de Valmont that the first real frisson shot through the audience.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41421][Michael Jordan]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E2D7173CF936A35751C1A9679C8B63][(2001/12/05/)]] But it's doubtful that the Lightning could justify trading ''the *Michael Jordan* of /hockey/'' for Gomez and White.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2009573][James Bond]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDA1630F933A25755C0A966958260][(1990/06/10/)]] But just as the James Bond of the Bond books gets lost in the Bond movies, the gaunt, teeth-baring, square-jawed Tracy of the comic strips is somehow sweetened and civilized in the Tracy movie.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3324839][Mosquito]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E5DB1431F93AA15752C1A9639C8B63][(2005/11/29/)]] But last month, Mr. Stapleton gave him a Mosquito for a free trial.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7815640][Tom Downey]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7D7113CF93BA35752C1A964958260][(1992/11/08/)]] But last week he was defeated by someone reminiscent of the Tom Downey of old: a young Turk who said the incumbent had become too distant.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q207][George W.

Bush for president chorus early enough.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q319079][Bob Dole]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E2D61131F935A2575BC0A960958260][(1996/08/16/)]] But lest his listeners think of him as sentimental, the Bob Dole of this speech is also a man of resolve.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q222134][Ted Kaczynski]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E3DC1F39F932A15757C0A960958260][(1996/04/21/)]] But many experts, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation serial crime unit that tracked the Unabomber for years,  consider him a member of the fold.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5595635][Grange]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEFDD1F3DF930A25750C0A96E948260][(1988/03/13/)]] But many members, like his father, have belonged to the Grange for a long time.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q180975][Andrew Lloyd Webber]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7D81F3BF933A25753C1A96E948260][(1988/10/10/)]] But more stems from |Mr. Jobs|'s reputation as the *Andrew Lloyd Webber* of /product introductions/, a master of stage flair and special effects.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37349][Dalai Lama]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E3DC1139F935A2575BC0A96F958260][(1999/08/16/)]] But most people seemed to take away something of what they had come searching for, and they praised the Dalai Lama for not elevating himself above those he addressed.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8016][Winston Churchill]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5DD1030F934A15750C0A9629C8B63][(2004/03/27/)]] But now |Clinton| is portrayed as the *Winston Churchill* of /the antiterror brigades/, and Bush is Neville Chamberlain.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q10993][Tiger Woods]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E1DC1F3EF933A05756C0A9629C8B63][(2004/05/30/)]] But now that he is a finalist for the Hart trophy as most valuable player for the second time and participating in the championship round for the first time, Iginla responded enthusiastically when asked questions about how |he| would feel to be known as the *Tiger Woods* of /hockey/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q19837][Steve Jobs]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7DD1339F937A1575BC0A964958260][(1992/08/24/)]] But now |the 36-year-old entrepreneur|, often called the *Steve Jobs* of /Japan/ in reference to the Apple Computer co-founder, is in the midst of a fight to save his company from bankruptcy.

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q91][Abraham Lincoln]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03EED61F39F93BA15754C0A96E958260][(1998/07/28/)]] But on the 19th-century list would be Charles Dickens and Herman Melville, Jane Austen and |Mark Twain| (''the *Lincoln* of /our literature/,'' said William Dean Howells).
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q359416][George Hamilton]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02EEDF1F39F931A25752C1A961958260][(1997/11/12/)]] But on the other hand, |he| was the *George Hamilton* of /the Senate/, spending so much time bronzing on his Capitol balcony that it was dubbed ''Dole's Beach.''
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q309905][John Nash]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04EFDA123CF930A35755C0A9679C8B63][(2001/06/03/)]] But only a hint of all that is reflected in a conversation with the John Nash of today.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7902373][Utah Jazz]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7D61E3DF932A35750C0A967958260][(1991/03/01/)]] But over the six weeks of shooting, they had a 10-9 record to drop into a duel with the Utah Jazz for the divisional lead.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11153][John Roberts]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04EFD71031F930A2575AC0A9639C8B63][(2005/09/13/)]] But people can change, Senator Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, observed, adding, ''So I will be looking for a somewhat different John Roberts than the John Roberts of 1985.''+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4583][Anne Frank]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07E1D9113BF935A35750C0A962958260][(1994/03/06/)]] But say "the *Anne Frank* of /Sarajevo/," and most of us know who you mean.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q128121][Mick Jagger]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E7DA103BF93BA25757C0A9629C8B63][(2004/04/18/)]] But she is breaking some of the nation's most delicate political china, so much so that one recent Vancouver newspaper article described |her| as the ''the *Mick Jagger* of /the accounting profession/.''
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q299211][Pierre Cardin]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01EFDD103AF93BA2575BC0A9649C8B63][(2002/08/18/)]] But should I be the Pierre Cardin of today, or full of hope like I was at 17 years of age?+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q517][Napoleon]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E6D9103BF932A35751C0A96E958260][(1998/02/01/)]] But skip the small, nothing-special oysters in Creole butter and the Napoleon of portobello mushrooms, grilled vegetables and goat cheese made too sour by an overdose of balsamic vinegar.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q363383][Armand Hammer]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E2D8133EF937A15754C0A962958260][(1994/07/24/)]] But such conspicuous spending only enhances |Turner|'s image here as the *Armand Hammer* of /post-Communist Russia/ -- the most ubiquitous, best-connected American businessman.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5480][Bart Simpson]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6D8123DF931A25750C0A962958260][(1994/03/12/)]] But take a healthy dose of |the man| once characterized as the *Bart Simpson* of /the Senate/, who has elevated the sustained whine to a rhetorical form.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q887401][Bo Jackson]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0DD153BF932A05753C1A966958260][(1990/10/31/)]] But teammates they are: Dooley, a fifth-year receiver, too slow and too small to be recruited, and Kirby, a sophomore running back who would only attend a school that would allow |him| to be the *Bo Jackson* of /autumn and winter/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q221048][Jackie Robinson]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE5DC1E3FF93AA25757C0A961958260][(1997/04/19/)]] But |the 21-year-old| who is often described as the *Jackie Robinson* of /golf/ blew off Jackie Robinson -- and the Fan in Chief.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q19673][Al Gore]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E7D81231F933A15756C0A9619C8B63][(2007/05/20/)]] But the Al Gore of September 2005 was not the Saint Albert of today.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q380433][Al Sharpton]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE0DB113AF933A25752C1A967958260][(1991/11/10/)]] But the Al Sharpton of "For the Color of His Skin" is a more sympathetic figure than the Al Sharpton of the daily press.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q42786][Audrey Hepburn]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3D61231F931A15757C0A967958260][(1991/04/22/)]] But the Audrey Hepburn of popular memory dates back to the 22 films she made between 1951 and 1966.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q436386][Rodney Dangerfield]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E5DD153EF936A35754C0A96E958260][(1998/07/05/)]] But the Chancellor has shown little inclination to bargain, prompting the union to dash off a news release the other day urging him ''to treat workers with respect'' -- a line that seemed apt for |an organization| that, in one sense, is the *Rodney Dangerfield* of /municipal unions/.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q298016][Fred Thompson]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E6D91530F932A35755C0A9619C8B63][(2007/06/01/)]] But the Fred Thompson of ''Law & Order'' fame is better suited as chief of staff.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1426891][Michael Myers]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE4DA1E31F935A15751C1A9609C8B63][(2006/12/26/)]] But |the Giants| are the *Michael Myers* of /football teams/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q193156][Ralph Nader]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D9103BF93BA25752C1A9669C8B63][(2000/11/18/)]] But the *Ralph Nader* of /this election/ is |Willie James|, not me.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4883][Ron Howard]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E3DE113EF930A35751C1A9609C8B63][(2006/12/03/)]] But the Ron Howard of ''Night Shift'' preceded the director of ''A Beautiful Mind,'' and before Sean Penn's Oscar turns came Jeff Spicoli.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q200586][Sheryl Crow]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1DC1731F931A25750C0A963958260][(1995/03/12/)]] But the Sheryl Crow of "Tuesday Night Music Club" is actually a committee product.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11242163][Mir]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E7DE1F3FF93AA2575BC0A961958260][(1997/08/19/)]] But the crew was then forced to shut down all major power systems and abandon the Mir for the Soyuz space capsule so they could use its engines to push the wobbling station back toward its orbit.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1889422][Felix Unger]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E3DA1639F93BA15752C0A960958260][(1996/01/28/)]] But the final word rests with |Mr. Dorian|, a lifelong movie fan whose office  is a library of film books, who can't read or watch a film without a yellow note pad in his lap and who calls himself the *Felix Unger* of /collectors of movie-related tidbits/.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23505][George H. W. Bush]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFD91F3CF937A25751C0A964958260][(1992/02/14/)]] But the first part of the strategy may prove more challenging, in part because conservative Republicans count Mr. Bush as a moderate apostate and in part because he has, in effect, begun a campaign against the George Bush of 1980.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81438][Walt Whitman]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E4DA1F3EF933A25753C1A96F958260][(1999/10/10/)]] But the landfill itself needs a *Walt Whitman* of /its own/, someone to celebrate the forces that play upon that immobile, phlegmatic mass, someone to stand over the dumpscape and shout, as Whitman did, ''I announce adhesiveness.''
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6722173][Mac]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9500E0D71739F930A15754C0A96E958260][(1998/07/23/)]] But the larger problem is that many software developers have abandoned the Mac for the bigger and more lucrative Windows market.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4354313][Rob Wright]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE7DD1731F932A35755C0A9659C8B63][(2003/06/01/)]] But |the manipulative and titanically smug Laingian therapist| she runs off with in Vienna is a *Mr. Wrong* of /a variety that, with footwear and psychobabble adjusted to more modern settings, Bridget and her cohort would instantly recognize/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8704][Walt Disney]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEFDE113AF934A2575AC0A963958260][(1995/09/17/)]] But the modern form of comics and animation was created in the two decades after World War II by |Osamu Tezuka|, who is known as the *Walt Disney* of /Japan/.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q259847][Katerina Maleeva]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4DC113DF933A15752C0A967958260][(1991/01/20/)]] But the most intriguing matchup in the women's fourth round could be between the Katerina Maleeva of Bulgaria, seeded fifth, and her 14-year-old sister Magdalena, who stunned Roslyn Fairbank-Nideffer, 6-2, 6-3.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q235262][Emmy]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7DA1438F936A35752C1A966958260][(1990/11/05/)]] But the night before the new television season began, "Murphy Brown" won the Emmy Award as best comedy, and its star, Candice Bergen, the Emmy for best comedy actress.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q19877670][Egyptian]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E5DA143AF93AA35755C0A96E958260][(1998/06/09/)]] But the organization, founded in 1984, has never had a permanent home, and it obtained the Egyptian for $1 from the city's Community Redevelopment Agency, which had acquired it from its last commercial owner.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q13685096][Cinderella]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5D9123DF935A25757C0A964958260][(1992/04/16/)]] But |the plain kitchen hutch| was the *Cinderella* of /the show/.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3822242][Mary Agnes Chase]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E6DE173EF930A2575BC0A9609C8B63][(2006/08/13/)]] But the points are reset when the Chase for the Nextel Cup begins after five more races, and Knaus is not backing off.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103846][Groucho Marx]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFDF1539F934A1575AC0A961948260][(1987/09/27/)]] But the tide eventually shifted, partly because the supreme materialist of physics, |Richard Feynman of the California Institute of Technology|, a man once described as the *Groucho Marx* of /physics/, turned the quest for nuclear substructure into a cause celebre.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3822242][Mary Agnes Chase]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4DB123FF936A15754C0A9639C8B63][(2005/07/25/)]] But the top 10 stayed the same, and six races remain until the field for the Chase for the Nextel Cup is set.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3822242][Mary Agnes Chase]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E3D61331F930A35754C0A9639C8B63][(2005/07/03/)]] But the two would surely not be disappointed to combine to keep as many competitors as possible from qualifying for the 10-race playoff known as the Chase for the Nextel Cup.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7963465][Wally Pipp]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7DF113AF931A35751C0A96E958260][(1998/02/02/)]] But then, by some reckonings, |Mr. Russell| was the *Wally Pipp* of /show business/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5202642][César Tovar]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE4D71738F934A15752C1A9649C8B63][(2002/11/27/)]] But there are nuances: a great team like the Atlanta Braves will cost more to watch on weekends than on weeknights, and a middling team like |the Philadelphia Phillies| has become a utilityman of sorts, the *César Tovar* of /the schedule/, moving through three ticket tiers depending on the date.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q169452][Shaquille O'Neal]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE0DA1E3FF932A35752C1A9649C8B63][(2002/11/01/)]] But there was no flag on the play, one of many that have fueled the belief in the Giants' organization that in the first season after Strahan broke the record for sacks, rules do not seem to apply when it comes to stopping him -- as if |Strahan| has become the *Shaquille O'Neal* of /the N.F.L./
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1173180][Dave Douglas]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE1D71431F936A1575BC0A9669C8B63][(2000/08/25/)]] But there's a resourcefulness here: the players use cheap electronics well, they mine a lot from simple vamps, and |the disciplined, versatile trumpeter Rob Mazurek| may yet become something like the *Dave Douglas* of /the Midwest/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1173180][Dave Douglas]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6DF143AF930A25752C0A9669C8B63][(2000/01/13/)]] But there's a resourcefulness here: they use cheap electronics well, they mine a lot of feeling from single vamps, and |the disciplined, versatile cornetist Rob Mazurek| may yet become the *Dave Douglas* of /the Midwest/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q34453][Boris Yeltsin]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7DF1F39F937A15754C0A96F948260][(1989/07/24/)]] But these are tumultuous times in the Soviet bloc, and |Mr. Modrow| is considered by many to be the *Boris Yeltsin* of /East Germany/ - a symbol of change and innovation among younger party members.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12813086][April]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E4D6123EF93BA15757C0A9619C8B63][(2007/04/28/)]] But this has been an April of indignities for the Yankees' closer, and Rivera had another such moment Friday night.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5593][Pablo Picasso]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E5D7133AF933A05752C1A9659C8B63][(2003/11/30/)]] But this is not about |Spurrier|'s view of himself as the *Picasso* among /finger painters in college coaching/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q133054][Sylvia Plath]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03E2DB1731F937A35752C1A9679C8B63][(2001/11/04/)]] But to devotees of |Kahlo| -- whom the writer Christopher Goodwin describes as ''feminism's premier art icon, the *Sylvia Plath* of /the canvas/'' -- the marriage to Rivera has all the ingredients of a heroic love story.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60029][Oskar Schindler]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DB163EF931A25751C1A960958260][(1996/12/12/)]] But to me, |John Rabe| is the *Oskar Schindler* of /China/, another example of good in the face of evil.''
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9004566][Marina]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEFDA173FF93AA15751C1A96F948260][(1989/12/29/)]] But to say that out loud would make a bad situation worse, so most homeowners declare that they love the Marina for its beauty, would not dream of leaving and are not frightened at the prospect of future earthquakes.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2903144][Bill Buckner]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406EEDE1F3EF934A35752C1A9649C8B63][(2002/11/07/)]] But today |Mr. Savaglio| is the *Bill Buckner* of /American politics/.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21609942][Heinrich Christian Strauss]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE0D9103FF936A35754C0A96E958260][(1998/07/05/)]] But union rules create difficulties, he explained: ''The manager in Philadelphia recently called me, all excited, to say I could have the Strauss for just $15,000.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11662][Steffi Graf]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4D71739F93BA15756C0A966958260][(1990/05/28/)]] But unlike her tearful and ghostly demeanor following her June 1989 loss to Sanchez Vicario, when she worried her family and coach by going into solitary confinement for a two-day crying jag, the Steffi Graf of May 1990 was somber yet composed in defeat.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q222134][Ted Kaczynski]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07E1DF1739F932A25755C0A960958260][(1996/06/11/)]] But we do know that the same law enforcement establishment was unable to track down the Unabomber for 17 years until his brother turned him in.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3559410][Vince Coleman]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0DD1F38F937A25751C1A966958260][(1990/12/14/)]] But we've been looking for a Vince Coleman for years.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q653366][Larry Kramer]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02EED71E38F932A25756C0A9669C8B63][(2000/05/11/)]] But when it came to details like cooperation, |she| was a disaster, the *Larry Kramer* of /the women's movement/.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q38222][George Lucas]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE7D91E3FF932A05752C0A9609C8B63][(2006/01/31/)]] But when the star being interviewed is someone deeply in sync with run-and-gun digital video and visual tone poems -- the supreme example being |Mr. Romanek|, who is the *George Lucas* of /the video world/ -- the effect can be to suggest entirely new reference points for the arts.
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8768][Henry Ford]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE6D81F3BF935A15752C1A9669C8B63][(2000/11/26/)]] But whereas Disney was primarily an impresario and an empire builder, the *Henry Ford* of /fantasy/, |Dr. Seuss|, who died in 1991 at the age of 87, conformed to a different American archetype: the solitary genius who happens, almost in spite of himself, to be a canny entrepreneur.
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37767][T. S. Eliot]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E6DC173FF937A35751C0A9619C8B63][(2007/02/04/)]] But while in many ways pessimistic, ''Man Gone Down'' also relies on the Eliot of ''Four Quartets.''+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q170779][Cassandra]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E0DD173AF937A25751C0A96F958260][(1999/02/14/)]] But while the Cassandra of old was cursed by Apollo to have her prophecies ignored, Mrs. O'Riley, who became enthusiastic about self-sufficiency when she left New York to homestead in the Alaskan bush, finds ready audiences of people who seem to secretly long for an extended Y2K camping experience.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6294][Hillary Clinton]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E0DD143DF932A05752C0A961958260][(1997/01/31/)]] But while the Hillary Clinton who testified on Capitol Hill about health care was not on display today, neither was the Hillary Clinton of the 1996 Presidential campaign, who shunned reporters and stuck mostly to safe topics and friendly crowds.+

+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q827411][Bert Lahr]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E7D61F31F932A25753C1A96F958260][(1999/10/11/)]] It takes a real clown to find the sympathy in such broadly drawn characters and turn the ire into humor, and Dan Wackerman, the Peccadillo director, does not have a Bert Lahr among his cast of 13 actors who tackle the more than 40 different roles.+
+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16210356][Elysium]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E7D6133FF93BA15754C0A9639C8B63][(2005/07/28/)]] It tells the story of a wealthy hunchback, Alviano Salvago, who detests his appearance and is filled with such hunger for beauty that he creates an island paradise, an Elysium of art and natural wonders.+

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2522402][Harry Winston]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E3DE1531F931A2575AC0A9609C8B63][(2006/09/12/)]] It was a present from 50 when I got out of jail a year ago,'' said Mr. Yayo, a member of the G-Unit, referring to a wristwatch roughly the scale and diameter of a hockey puck, covered with pavé diamonds and designed by |Jacob Arabo|, the *Harry Winston* of /the bling-bling set/.

+[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q168733][Valentine]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E6D9173FF936A35750C0A96F958260][(1999/03/05/)]] 'It was easy finding a Valentine for someone like you,'' the card said on its cover.+

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q223766][P. T.

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q369675][Johnny Appleseed]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E6DF133CF932A25755C0A9669C8B63][(2000/06/11/)]] It was only after the *Johnny Appleseed* of /tulips/, a botanist named |Carolus Clusius|, cultivated and cataloged tulip varieties and gave them away as gifts that tulipomania really took hold.

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41166][Jonathan Swift]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02EEDC1439F931A35752C0A9639C8B63][(2005/01/02/)]] It wasn't Jerry Orbach addressing me, but the character he'd created and so thoroughly inhabited: |Lennie Briscoe|, the *Jonathan Swift* of /the N.Y.P.D./, quintessential tough-skinned, nasty-tongued, broken-hearted New Yorker.

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7352498][Robin Hood]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E5D61230F937A35752C1A961958260][(1997/11/04/)]] This national logo is the brainchild of |John Krimsky|, the deputy secretary general of the U.S.O.C., who sees himself as the *Robin Hood* for /obscure biathletes, fencers and other endangered Olympic species/.

And however this esthetic may have conflicted with Bach's, Heinichen's concertos, at least in their externals, recall the Bach of the "Brandenburg" Concertos and the orchestral suites, especially his tendency to blur the distinctions between the two forms.+
[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q103846][Groucho Marx]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D8163DF931A15751C1A961948260][(1987/12/22/)]] This season they have hidden him somewhere behind the boys' clothing section; and yes, his black-rimmed eyeglasses make |him| the *Groucho Marx* of /the Kringle clan/.

[[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2808][Elton John]] [[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E4DB1431F932A25751C1A9609C8B63][(2006/12/11/)]] Though Foujita had a fashion sense that made |him| look like the *Elton John* of /Montparnasse/ (he favored earrings, bangs and show-stopping homemade costumes), and though he is seen here hand in hand with a male Japanese friend during their shared tunic-wearing phase, he is viewed by Ms. Birnbaum strictly as a lady-killer.
