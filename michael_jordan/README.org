The California high school sophomore, who is also the first black player ever to win the junior championship, may be the best adolescent golfer to come along since Bobby Jones won the Georgia State Amateur in 1944 at the age of 14. Mr. Woods began playing as a toddler, and shot a 48 over nine regulation holes at the age of 3. He marks the progress of his career against that of Jack Nicklaus, whom he intends to supplant as the golf world's consensus all-time greatest.

- 1996/01/17/0823248	        In large part, this is due to the fact that Guys approach food as they do most things. Like, for example, war. Or its corollary, sports. When a Guy starts cooking, he wants to be the Joe Montana of mousse, *the Michael Jordan of*  julienne, the Cal Ripken Jr.
- 1996/05/10/0849554	        "Mr. Burry is *the Michael Jordan of* integrating insurance and health care, so he commands a pretty big salary," said William Silverman, a spokesman for Blue Cross.

- 1998/03/30/1006144	        ''*the Michael Jordan of* women's basketball,'' Barmore called Holdsclaw.

- 1999/01/17/1077956	 Doubt it? Check out his news clippings. Jorge Campos isn't necessarily the world's best soccer player, but he can't go anywhere in his country without being recognized. To his publicist, that makes him *the Michael Jordan of* Mexico.

- 2001/11/04/1339731	        While he was a particularly obnoxious version, Yankee fans have long been the ugly Americans of sport. Like the old stereotype of Americans abroad, Yankee fans flaunt an assumption of wealth and dominance. In their case, it's from wearing pin-striped shirts bearing the numbers of the most storied players in baseball history -- the Babe (now known as *the Michael Jordan of* his time), Lou Gehrig (if he hadn't died under contract, he would still be playing and nobody would know Cal Ripken), Joe DiMaggio (less mysteriously dignified but more interesting since the recent publication of a sour bio), Yogi Berra (in a deserved comeback as the role model for Yoda) and Mickey Mantle (redeemed by a gutsy death and Billy Crystal's movie, ''61*'').
- 2001/11/08/1340953	        In his new ''Music of the Line/ Words in Shape,'' which completed the program, the first two of three central trios glow with wonderfully inventive choreography that is full of quietly humane surprises, as do a quartet and a solo in ''Mix 25.''

- 2001/12/05/1348659	        AS a Quebec teenager, he was compared to Jean Béliveau, the best center in the Montreal Canadiens' elegant history. When he was the No. 1 choice over all in the N.H.L.'s 1998 entry draft, he was touted by the Tampa Bay Lightning as ''*the Michael Jordan of* hockey'' -- the ultimate sports mixed metaphor.
- 2001/12/05/1348659	        Center Scott Gomez and defenseman Colin White were mentioned in the reported trade talk and for Lecavalier, and the Devils would probably part with those two.

- 2002/07/25/1410921	        In Pletcher's case, he would like, just once, to hear his name without the qualification that he is a former assistant to D. Wayne Lukas. He learned much from Lukas, who statistically is *the Michael Jordan of* horse racing, and he is grateful.
- 2002/12/22/1450658	        Mr. Barta is neither a Jethro Clampett nor a redneck. He said his political views were ''just to the right of Attila the Hun,'' but he talks about honor and chivalry, grew up in a well-to-do family in Westchester with a second home in Maine, learned his manners at preppy New England boarding schools and buys and sells corporate jets for a living. He writes for Sport Fishing, Marlin and Big Game Fishing Journal magazines and The Improper Hamptonian. He flies turboprops and light jets, skydives and runs an annual blue marlin tournament that has raised $775,000 for charity in the last six years. This month he appeared as the outdoors consultant on ''The Best Damn Sport Show, Period'' with Tom Arnold on Fox Sports. He was introduced as *the Michael Jordan of* hunting and fishing.
- 2003/03/09/1471019	        A month later, Bowden was using only superlatives. ''He's *the Michael Jordan of* the game,'' Bowden said.
- 2003/06/03/1494048	        ''The next thing you know, I get cut for Mr. Indiana Basketball,'' Bowen said. ''I posted him up, shot right over him and scored. The coach says, 'I don't want that.' You don't want that? He was *the Michael Jordan of* Indiana.
