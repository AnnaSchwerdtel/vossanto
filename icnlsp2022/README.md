## Datasets

### English datasets

- [NYT-0](nyt.org): The dataset contains more sentences since they are
  split up, such that each sentence only contains one VA. If a
  sentence contains multiple VA expressions, the sentence appears
  multiple times with different annotations in this dataset. Needs to
  be preprocessed. Also duplicate sentences from different articles
  are not removed yet.
