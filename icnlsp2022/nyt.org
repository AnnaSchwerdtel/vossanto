- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q296][Claude Monet]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D7123CF933A15750C0A961948260][03/20/1987]]) However, you can certainly get into the Andre Mayer galleries at the Met, where there is a Claude Monet of 1873 called ''Apple Trees in Bloom'' that will be the best possible substitute.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9960][Ronald Reagan]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DF153EF933A15750C0A961948260][03/20/1987]]) But after about a half-dozen questions, he seemed to hit his stride, answering at some length and with considerably more composure, even though he never oozed self-confidence like the Ronald Reagan of old.

- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q313013][Brian Wilson]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6D61731F935A15755C0A96E948260][06/26/1988]]) Anyone who remembers the rock musician of the 1970's and early 80's would be astonished by the Brian Wilson of today.

Clouden, who by evoking the seafaring ways of his ancestors, and their descendants' supposed mistreatment at the hands of Grenadians, has begun to arouse strong nationalist passions in his neighbors.
- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q235262][Emmy]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DA143FF932A25754C0A96E948260][07/11/1988]]) Mr. Griffiths is an independent television producer who won an Emmy for ''Domingo Salutes Seville,'' a PBS show, and who worked with Mr. Domingo two years ago on the Central Park concert celebrating the centenary of the Statue of Liberty.

- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q551032][John Wooden]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E2D91731F93BA35751C1A9609C8B63][12/08/2006]]) Years before her mother would co-write a book with Anson Dorrance -- the John Wooden of women's college soccer, whose Tar Heel program spawned, among others, Mia Hamm -- Yael was insisting that was where she would go.

- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q177984][Peter Sellers]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E1DA143DF930A25750C0A962958260][03/13/1994]]) Mr. Kubrick told him, "I think you're becoming the Peter Sellers of the cutting room," and encouraged him to direct.

- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q134183][Magic Johnson]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E1DC1E39F930A25756C0A962958260][05/13/1994]]) Once upon a time, Mason could have been the Magic Johnson of Turkey or Venezuela, a very large man with superior open-court dribbling.

- [[https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5592][Michelangelo]] ([[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E1D7163AF93BA25757C0A9659C8B63][04/18/2003]]) (The French critic ThÃ©ophile Gautier called him the Michelangelo of the menagerie.)
